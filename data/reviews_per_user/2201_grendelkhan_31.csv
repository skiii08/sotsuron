The Avengers," A fine film for the faithful and the casual.
","The story goes that back in 1961, Martin Goodman, the owner of a struggling comic book company, played a round of golf with one of the owners of DC Comics. The man was doing a bit of boasting of their recent success with their Justice League comic, a revival of the all-star team concept of the Justice Society of the 40s. Goodman went back to his editor and asked for something like it. That editor (Stan Lee)put his head together with the company's best artist (Jack Kirby) and they conceived the Fantastic Four. The stakes were high, as the company was close to going under. It paid off and the Marvel Age of Comics, as Lee liked to call it, had arrived. This hit would spawn more, eventually leading to a true rival for the concept of the Justice League, a team of Marvel all-stars; and the Avengers were born. Throughout the years, the Avengers would be a book of visual flair, action and epic tales. In various hands, the book would feature not just a group of stars, but a real team.Now, almost 50 years later, Marvel Studios has done the same. Frustrated with the lack of control over their cinematic adaptations, even when things worked out well, Marvel formed their own production company. They did not have an easy job, as their biggest name characters had long ago been sewn up by Fox and Sony. They would have to start with characters who weren't as well known, outside of the comic world. They began with Iron Man. The film proved a hit, both with the casual audience and the fans who followed the comic over the years. It was well written, well cast, well acted, and well executed. Marvel didn't rest and progressed with their plan to introduce a new movie in close succession to the previous one. Much like the comics, paths crossed and old heroes welcomed new. One by one, the members of the Avengers came forward. It all came to a head with the Avengers movie.The film is first rate, with a great cast and excellent visuals. The previous films established the characters, so time didn't need to be wasted reintroducing the characters. Much like James Bond, we start with action and stop only to plan for the next event. The scope is epic enough to warrant a team of people, rather than an episode any single member could handle (a common fault in many Justice League stories, where Superman dominated all). Joss Whedon, a fan with strong credentials in the comic world, hits the notes right. He introduces the threat, then begins assembling the team. However, teams in the Marvel world rarely work harmoniously at the beginning. They test each other, argue, trade barbs; but, when it counts they get down to business. This truly felt like the comic brought to life, much as Richard Donner's Superman had before, and Christopher Nolan's Batman had more recently.It's not a perfect film, though. There are a few to many convenient moments, like the scientist unconsciously building a failsafe into the dimensional gateway. Hawkeye and Black Widow are still underdeveloped, as they had little more than cameos in the previous films. Dialogue suggests a history, but they are still mostly cyphers to non-fans. Many character moments ended up on the cutting room floor, due to time constraints, so we don't really get to experience Captain America struggling with an unfamiliar world. In a related note, Cap never really sounds like someone from the 40s. Hopefully, sequels will be able to explore these things more and the film series can mature beyond just an action spectacle, as the comics did. Whedon and the cast & crew certainly gave a foundation on which to build.There are many moments to enjoy, from Whedon's trademark wisecracking dialogue, to Tom Hiddleston's layered villain, to the revelation of SHIELD as more than just a glorified Marvel FBI. There are some excellent quiet moments in all of the thunder and we see the human costs of the battle, which is too often missing from these things. In the end, the film earns its success. Here's hoping that Marvel won't rest on that success and try to venture into some of their other books, especially those that don't revolve around superheroes. The company produced some fine western and sci-fi characters, not to mention someone needs to do a Howard the Duck film that is as good as the comic was.",8,0,5,28 September 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining, if not very deep.
","This is a lighter film from Spielberg, which makes for a nice change. Unfortunately, it's also a bit disconnected. It's lacking an emotional center and comes off a bit cold, although it does have a certain charm. It also has a tendency to downplay the seriousness of the crimes committed, while it glorifies the ingenuity of the criminal.The actors are fine, if a bit cold. DiCaprio (not a favorite of mine) is good as the smooth talking con man, although he isn't quite as convincing when he tries to slip into the cover roles that the character assumes. He's doesn't look like he could pass for an older figure, as the real Frank Abignale did.Tom Hanks is his usual self, some good scenes, some mediocre. He can be a good actor, but he seems to take himself too seriously in his dramatic roles. I thought his performances were much better in his comedies.Christopher Walken is great, as usual, as the influence and motivating factor in Frank Abignale's life. He lives his life as a lie and provides the blueprint for is son to do the same.The period detail and music are good, without hitting you over the head, as in Down With Love. Some attitudes don't ring true, but that is a minor quibble. The pace is leisurely, if a bit too much so when the 'chase is on.' Thankfully, Spielberg is not of the 'epileptic editing' generation of filmmakers.Ultimately, this is an entertaining, if lightweight film. It's a nice caper story that tries for sympathy, but never quite gets it. Like most capers, it treats serious crime with a laissez faires attitude, but is lacking the subtle charm of a classic caper film. It never decides if it is a comedy or a drama and doesn't seamlessly blend the two. Still, it provides enough entertainment to sustain interest. Worth a rental or a matinée viewing, but not destined for any top 10 lists.",Null,1,3,16 October 2004
Casablanca," One of the Greatest Films of All Time
","All my life (36 years), I have heard what a great film Casablanca is; yet, I never sat down to watch it.  A romance? Ugh!  I heard the cliches over and over, saw the numerous references throughout various media, and read its title on every 'Greatest' list.  Finally, I decided to rent it and watch it. I was blown away.  I have been called a cynic by friends, but this film moved me like few others.The movie has everything for any viewer: romance, intrigue, suspense, drama, comedy, great characters, a wonderful score, politics, inspiration, history, adventure, great songs, and great performances.  The scene where Paul Henreid has the orchestra play 'La Marseilles' brought tears to my eye. Here were refugees singing in defiance of their oppressors, regardless of the consequences.  It is easy to see why it stirred audiences of the time.The ending is a classic and one of the finest ever conceived.  I can find no fault with this film; only with myself for ignoring it for so long.",Null,0,0,29 December 2002
The Fifth Element," Great European Sci-fi
","When I first heard about this movie, I knew I wanted to see it and I had a hell of a time when I did. I could see right away that this film was heavily influenced by the work of French graphic artist Moebius. Sure enough, when I saw the credits, there was Moebius' name. The film captures the European sci-fi style that permeated Metal Hurlant and featured the work of Moebius and other top European artists. I think this is one of the facets that many film critics couldn't understand. They only seem to be able to handle Kubrick or Lucas. I was amazed that many called the film incomprehensible. It makes more sense than the last third of 2001: A Space Odyssey!The film has nice balance of action, drama and comedy. It doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it degenerate into camp; and, it is always exciting. Bruce Willis puts in a nice turn as the hero and Mila Jovavich shines as Leeloo. Gary Oldman gets to chew some scenery and Ian Holm is always good. Heck, even Tiny Lister is passable, which is saying a lot for him. The music is outstanding, as is always the case with Eric Serra. The opera piece was hypnotic. I didn't even mind Chris Tucker.I have heard some people claim that the story is borrowed from the Harry Canyon sequence from Heavy Metal. Actually, Harry Canyon was borrowed (or stolen) from Moebius and Dan O'Bannon's 'The Long Tomorrow', a Dashiell Hammet rif in a sci-fi setting. The producers were unable to secure the rights for the story and created their own, similar sory (much like Tarna was inspired by Arzach). The Fifth Element owes more to the Valerian graphic novels by Jean-Claude Mezieres and Pierre Christin. These stories date back to the late 60's, and Mezieres was a conceptual designer, along with Moebius, for The Fifth Element. Moebius' 'Incal' was also a major influence. In fact, the original story for this movie was changed to make the hero a taxi driver (instead of a factory worker) after seeing a flying taxi in Mezieres' latest Valerian album.Although there is no set up for a sequel, I would love to see these characters again, or see Besson work in sci-fi again. I need something to take away the bad taste of the new Star Wars films! (By the way, was the Princess Leia hairdo on the female soldier a deliberate homage? I laughed my head off when I saw that scene in the theater.)",Null,0,1,25 February 2003
The Mummy," 'Weird Tales' come to life!
","Regardless of what critics say, I love this film.  It was like watching a modern pulp adventure.  The humor works well in conjunction with the action. The characters are likeable and the actors have fun.  The scenery s put to good use and the effects are used in service of the story.To say that this is a cheap Raiders of the Lost Ark rip-off, is to say that film is nothing but a bunch of Republic serial cliffhangers strung together. Raiders was influenced by the Republic adventure serials, as well as the old pulp novels.  'The Mummy' is obviously also influenced by those old pulps; one part Adventure Stories and one part Weird Tales.  Like Raiders, it uses humor to keep things lively.  Unlike Raiders, it plays up the horror elements more.I don't care what anyone else thinks; this is a fun film.  Heck, I even liked the sequel, for the most part.  It has a lot more problems, but it was still fun.  Personally, I would like to see more of these characters, although enough with Imhotep!",Null,0,1,17 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Care Bears Save the Universe
","This one is a mixed bag, for me.  Empire delivered so well on the promise of Star Wars, that expectations were even higher here.  Well, they didn't quite pan out.  The movie starts out well, but gets lost a bit in the middle, and is uneven at the end.Spoilers, but who doesn't know what happens in these films?The introduction of the new Death Star is fine, as are the scenes revolving around the attempt to rescue Han. Luke's entrance as a full Jedi has impact. The only problem here is how far advanced Luke seems, compared to how much time appears to have passed since the end of Empire.  Hormonal teenagers got to drool over slave girl Leia, an image that came from a Frazetta painting and entered into many a fanboy's fantasy.  Han gets thawed out, but doesn't really get to lay the smackdown on Boba Fett.  Fett only gets dumped into the most Freudian image yet in these films.The middle drags a bit.  The introduction of the Emperor is great, as he definitely looks like someone who could control Vader.  The Endor mission is straight out of every WWII commando movie.  The speeder bike segments are good; you can only really detect the models in a few shots.  Then, enter the Ewoks.Rumor has it that Wookies were originally intended to be the primitive force that helps bring down the Empire.  Since they were shown to be too sophisticated, the race was changed; to a bunch of teddy bears.  OK, the Ewoks have a few moments, but mostly they were there to be cute for the little kids.Aside from the Care Bears, er, Ewoks, we have the Luke, Leia revelation, that puts a weird spin on Star Wars and makes Allen Dean Foster's Splinter of the Mind's Eye really twisted.  Quite frankly, this was too big a pill to swallow.  The Vader-Luke relationship was one thing (and I still maintain that it wasn't in the cards, initially), but this is just another surprise for the sake of replacating Empire's big secret.  It's also a convenient way to get Luke out of the love triangle without a fight, or something that might require good writing.The finale works for about two thirds of it.  The space battle is spectacular and the lightsaber duel tops Empire's.  It was fun watching someone other than Luke take out the Imperials.  The shots of the damaged Star Destroyers always bring cheers.  The problem is the Endor battle.The forest battle is too cute.  There are too many spots played for laughs, in what should be a serious battle.  The one death of an Ewok is the lone serious moment, and it it just too, 'aw, the little bear got smooshed.' Had this been played more seriously, as it was in the novelization, there would probably be fewer Ewok-haters.In all, this is still a good film; but, with big flaws that presage the mess of the prequels.  The problem seems to come from George meddling to much, a weak director, and too much emphasis on commercialism.  Irvin Kershner was strong enough to check Lucas' more extreme tendencies, but Marquand wasn't. In fact, most stories tend to hint that Lucas pretty much whispered instructions into Marquand's ears.  That may be fanboy jealousy, but there is some truth in that idea.  Still, the film does end on a high note and delivers enough of the goods that you forgive its shortcomings.  The music change at the end of the Special Edition is unnecessary, but the celebrations were a nice bonus.  My only quibble is that the Empire wouldn't crumble that quickly.  Yes, without the fleet, much of the Empire's firepower was gone, but there still had to be a strong stormtrooper presence in the key areas.  This was an idea that Timothy Zahn explored beautifully in his first Star Wars trilogy.Hopefully, on that grand day when the Star Wars dvd's are released, George will have listened to the large number of people who want to see the films in their original state, warts and all.",Null,2,4,19 June 2003
Captain America: The First Avenger," Fourth Time is the Charm...(mostly)
","It's been a long road to a major motion picture for the good Captain, with many potholes along the way. First, there was the 1944 Republic Studios movie serial, starring Dick Purcell, with little identifiable from the comic (the script had been created for another comic book character, probably Fawcett Comics' Mr. Scarlet). Then, there were two made-for-TV movies (pilots for a series), starring Reb Brown, which drew on more elements, though suffered from budget and lackluster writing and directing (clear plexi shield didn't help). The 1990 21st Century production, starring Matt Salinger didn't even make it to theaters in the US and is a textbook case of no money, poor direction, and bad producing. Finally, we have a Captain America film with a budget and a definite connection to the source material; and it's pretty darn good! The cast are universally excellent, with Chris Evans having the hard task of playing a good, honest, determined hero. That's a lot tougher than a villain or more flawed person. Evans lets you connect to Steve Rogers the man, so you cheer for him when he becomes the hero and symbol of a country at war with evil. We share his frustration when he is held to a propaganda role. We cheer as he smashes the bad guys with his mighty shield. We keep hoping for him to finally land the girl.The first half of the film is brilliant, detailing the origin story. Steve is a man determined to stand up to the bullies of the world, no matter how many times he gets knocked down. We see him get his chance and prove his mettle, even before he receives the super soldier formula. The film hits every note perfectly up to the point where he defies orders to undertake a rescue mission. Then, the chief flaw of the film comes to the fore.The studio was so determined to lead into Avengers that it sacrifices the second half of the film and plots for potential sequels. The montage of attacks by Cap and the Howling Commando demands to be expanded further. It feels like one or two more movies was truncated into about 10 minutes, then a mad rush to the climax. Joe Johnston was working the same brilliance he displayed in the Rocketeer, until he's forced to kick the film into overdrive. It's not bad, but you feel cheated out of scenes and time with characters, especially Bucky. We really get a Cliffs Note version of their friendship, which makes Bucky's apparent death less impactful. The Howling Commandos are also cheated of time to connect to the audience. All the actors do great work, with a few scenes and lines (Thor had the same problem with the Warriors Three).The film is still quite good, but could have been great, given some more time. As it stands, it still rates above the rest of the Marvel Studios films, except possibly Iron Man. Here's hoping that Avengers will pick up the character and give the audience more time with him, without feeling like half the story was left for another time.",Null,0,1,29 October 2011
Notting Hill," Charming, If Slightly Improbable Romance
","Writer Richard Curtis set out to answer a question: What if I showed up to a regular get-together with friends, accompanied by the World's Most Famous Woman? This is his answer. Hugh Grant plays a bookshop owner, in Notting Hill, who lives his life within a very small area. Of course, as these things go, he has a chance encounter with Julia Roberts, who is stretching her acting muscles by playing a famous, superstar actress. After an awkward first encounter, a series of events lead to a slightly more charming, if improbable second encounter. From there, an incredulous, and rocky romance develops.As with four Weddings and a Funeral, the film is largely a series of sketches, driven by dialogue between the characters. Curtis excels at this kind of stuff and his scripts have memorable exchanges. Perhaps his plots are a bit far fetched, though stranger things have been known to happen. They do tend to tread a bit on a romantic fantasy of life; but it is a romantic comedy, after all.The cast are first rate, with Hugh Grant returning to the Curtis world as yet another charming, awkward man. He can pretty much play this part in his sleep. Julia Roberts plays a version of herself, though with a bit of tweaking here and there. The rest of the cast are filled with terrific character actors, including Curtis alumni Tim McInnerny (Black Adder series) and Emma Chambers (Vicar of Dibley), as well as newcomers Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville, James Dreyfuss and Rhys Ifans. Curtis knows how to write character pieces and these actors make music of his writing.It's easy to pick apart the reality of the film, that a famous actress would find true love with an ordinary guy that she, literally, bumped into; but, the scenario is so wonderfully done that you don't really care. The chemistry between the leads makes you forget the plot holes and the rest of the cast create an atmosphere that would be attractive to anyone, famous or not. It doesn't have a huge laugh quotient, but peppers the film with some really great comedic moments to keep you amused, while it charms you and brings a tear or two to your eye (like the scenes at the park bench, or when Roberts is in Grant's shop, begging him to forgive her). You can dismiss it as forgettable fluff; but, chances are, you'll be swept up in it, even if it's for just a little while. That's what movies do.",8,0,1,30 November 2014
Watchmen," Music Video version of the story
","I'll preface this by saying I have an inherent bias; I read the comics when they first came out. No movie can compare to that experience, nor to reading the complete book. It was specifically designed to exploit the unique strengths of comics as a storytelling medium. Trying to leave that out, how is the film as a purely cinematic experience? Enh.The film is nicely shot and staged, but the performances vary from great(Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan), very good (Billy Cruddup), uneven (Patrick Wilson, Malin Akerman) to lifeless (Matthew Goode). The film is more of a string of music videos, with dialogue in between, than a single narrative. Many of the line readings are flat, which detracts from otherwise fine scenes. The Nixon make-up is laughably bad and distracting. Those scenes come across like a bad SNL skit. The historical montages are very good and the most effective pieces.Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan really bring their characters to life, which is good, as they are central to the narrative. Billy Cruddup manages a fine performance, even while dealing with effects rigging for the CGI visuals.I have only viewed the director's cut on DVD, so can't really comment about the theatrical cut. Suffice to say, it's a long 3 hours. It is engaging at times, but it's like riding in a car with a manual transmission and a brand new driver; there are a lot of fits and stops, with occasional smooth moments.Ultimately the film is disappointing. It does attempt to bring the source material to life, but it gets bogged down by the weight of the material, and is unable to capture most of the subtext. At the risk of fan heresy, I would say the film would have been better served to depart more from the source material to make a tighter story. For a full on adaptation, a mini-series would have been a better vehicle, as the time to properly translate each chapter would be better used. As a theatrical experience, it doesn't flow well.Anyone looking for a pure action movie would be disappointed by the source material, as well as the film. Watchmen is about the concept of the hero versus the reality of the world's problems. It does have action scenes, but they are not at the center. The film does convey the jist of those ideas, without really exploring their depths. Really, you could have gone two ways with this film and been more successful. You could go the Kubrick route, ala 2001, and explore the ideas presented; or, the pure action route and just focused on the murder mystery/conspiracy. This film tries both, but succeeds at neither. It's a worthy attempt, but, ultimately, a failed one.",5,1,3,27 July 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Ambitious and successful
","Peter Jackson set out to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, a monumental undertaking by anyone's reasoning. Immediately, people questioned whether he could succeed. The story was too long, too dense; the characters too complex, too different. Other filmmakers had failed before. Weta was untested on this kind of scale. The director makes low budget horror films. How can this succeed? Oh ye of little faith! Jackson was an intelligent director. He knew that the story would need to play out over more than one film, plus, the story would have to be pared down to the essential details. The right actors would need to be cast, and everything must be believable. He first convinced Hollywood to take a chance, and then convinced them that his home country, New Zealand, would make the perfect setting. Then, he began assembling the right mix of people.Writers Fran Walsch and Phillipa Boyens, along with Jackson, undertook the task of distilling the essential story out of the book. Some favorite parts were jettisoned, but their choices were well thought out. They shifted dialogue between characters, expanded some, and paid tribute to others. However, the true essence of Tolkien's story remained.The casting was near-perfect. Each actor brought something special to their character. Veteran actors worked alongside relative unknowns, motivating the young actors to step up their game. The performances are uniformly good, with each actor getting their moment to stand out and to support their fellow actors. It was truly an ensemble.The New Zealand locations were awe-inspiring. You really felt like you were in another, ancient world. The land became a character unto itself.Weta Workshop and Weta Digital proved they were up to the task of creating this world; and, in so doing, proved they were the equal of any Hollywood effects house. From the designs to the sets, costumes to make-up, everything made this fantasy world more real.The film provides sweeping vistas and tight character focus. The camera moves with the action and stays still for actor's moment. Each piece of glorious detail is taken in, while expanding to show the entire scene.The music hits all the right beats, without making itself the focus. It enhances the emotion, without solely providing the emotion. It is equally soaring and terrifying, somber and joyous. It is of an epic scale, to match the epic story.This film captures the beginning of Frodo's journey, from quiet life to deadly mission. We are introduced to his colleagues and his antagonists. The saga unfolds and we are drawn in. By film's end, we truly believe this world and the inhabitants within. Now, the question is, can this magic be sustained? The next installment would answer that.",Null,1,2,7 January 2005
Man of Steel," Superman for the Video Game Age
","Let me preface this by saying I am a fan of Superman. I grew up reading the comics and they helped shape my moral outlook. Superman grew from wish fulfillment in the Great Depression into an icon of the best of humanity; at least, as much as a fictional character can embody that. He went from being a character created to entertain children into a figure of modern mythology, known the world over. I still remember standing in line to see the Richard Donner film and watching the story unfold; cheering as Christopher Reeve flew towards the camera and then banked off to the side. Superman has been adapted to the times; and so, given that it sometimes feels like we are in very dark times (war, shootings in schools, government shutdowns organized as powerplays, environmental disasters, etc...) we get a dark Superman. However, it can't even find the human connection in the darkness. Instead, it wallows in video game-like destruction, with few consequences for the principal characters. The Screen Junkies group, in their brilliant Honest Trailer, summed it up best: 'God forbid a Superman movie be any fun!'The film first serves up a Krypton that is derived from Avatar, with little to make us care about its destruction. It might have as well been the prologue to a game that is immediately skipped so player can start punching things. Next, we get a Cliffs Notes summation of Clark's isolation from humanity, while he tries to find his purpose. Smallville (the TV show)it ain't. Again, we just seem to be marking time before we start smashing things. We next encounter Lois Lane, who apparently has ticked off the military but goodness knows why, given that she doesn't exactly exude that charisma that a star investigative reporter would have. Then, enter Zod and company to start the destruction.I could live with mindless destruction if I gave a damn about the characters. Henry Caville is a lump of beefcake with the emotional range of a turnip. Amy Adams, a decent actress, doesn't exactly fill Lois with the personality of the hard-charging reporter. There is no spark between the two, unlike Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. Their relationship is really rather clinical, like the script is afraid to have real emotions, for fear of losing a teenaged male audience. So, instead, we just start blasting and smashing things, with no visible consequences to innocent bystanders or regards to the laws of physics. Even Avengers managed to bring moments of the human cost of things to the moments of destruction.There are germs of ideas here, like the potential reaction of humanity to a known alien, especially one endowed with tremendous power. The idea that the government would feel threatened by a power it can't control. The film never really gets beyond introducing these ideas as it instead goes for effects work to keep up the visual distractions. As such, there is such an artifice to the film that the viewer has trouble connecting to anything. The only human moment that meant anything to me was at the end, when we flashback to young Clark running around with his dog and Jonathan Kent recognizes the potential in his son to be a hero for humanity.The end result hear is a dark and soulless film. I keep returning to the metaphor of a video game because that is how I felt during the film. What little story there is exists only to bridge the next effects scene, with little future consequence or character development. It's not storytelling; it's marking time. Richard Donner is still king and Christopher Reeve is still the truly iconic Superman. Warner would be better served talking to the creative people at Warner Animation, who crafted the brilliant Batman The Animated Series, Superman TAS, and Justice League. They were able to create epic stories with believable characters. Smallville was better able to craft a relatable hero out of Superman and put a new spin on the myth, while still paying homage to the legacy.Do yourself a favor, watch the Donner film, or Superman the Animated Series. Seek out Elliot S! Maggin's novel 'Superman, Last Son of Krytpon.' Read one of the thousands of classic stories from the past 75 years; or, play a real video game because at least then you will be able to have an active involvement with the story.",4,2,6,5 January 2014
Batman Begins," True to the source.
","Finally, we have a Batman film that lives up to the nearly 65-year legacy of the character. Batman Begins transfers the true essence of Batman to the screen, while taking advantage of the strengths of cinema. It takes its place alongside Superman The Movie and X-Men as the standards to which comic book adaptations should aspire.Christoper Nolan has grounded the film in the real world. He brings an underlying logic and rationalization to the concepts of Batman, from the decay and corruption of Gotham, to the technology employed by Batman in his war. Everything looks as if it could really function. Batman has long been inspired by real world technology and ideas, from Bill Finger's (original Batman writer) files of Popular Mechanics clippings, to current research into microfibers and vehicle designs. But what really stands out is that he has captured the true essence of the character: Bruce Wayne is the mask, Batman is the true identity. Batman was born in the violent event that took away Bruce's parents, and young Bruce's innocence died alongside them. From that point on, his life revolved around his crusade.Christian Bale is magnificent in the dual role. Much like Christopher Reeve, he understands that each identity must be played as a separate character. His voice, mannerisms, and body language are different as Bruce and Batman. He has an intensity in his eyes that is true to the character. He also wonderfully portrays Buce Wayne's mask, as the vapid playboy. The fact that he has signed on for three films gives great hope for the movies to come.The cast is filled with outstanding actors: Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, Katie Holes, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman; but it is Michael Caine who most stands out. He shows his range, bringing caring and compassion, along with irony and sarcasm. He shifts modes like a true master of his craft.The effects are fantastic and in service to the story. There are few gratuitous stunts or explosions and CGI is kept to the essential moments. If I have one complaint, it's that the fight scenes are a bit too chaotic. They are not as 'epileptic' as other recent movies of this ilk; but, they don't allow you to take in the essence of the fight, as in the golden age of James Bond, or Bruce Lee. They are more impressionistic, with a few key poses emerging from the chaos.The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is suitably epic in scope, propelling the story along and adding grandeur. It takes its place alongside Danny Elfman's work in the Burton films.The script is top notch, focusing on Bruce Wayne's motivations and development. It keeps the characters grounded in reality, while providing exciting scenes.This is the perfect Father's Day film. Fathers are at the core of the story. First, we are introduced to the loving, caring Thomas Wayne. He is father not only to Bruce, but to Gotham as well. His death deprives both of a great influence. Alfred becomes a surrogate father to Bruce, reminding him of his family's legacy, while providing guidance in his crusade. Ducard is a stern father who teaches Bruce tough lessons, but also helps Bruce determine his true goal. Luscious Fox was a friend of Thomas Wayne, and provides material support to Bruce in his battles. James Gordon is another mentor and sounding board. Each has his role in shaping Bruce Wayne/Batman into the figure he becomes. They impart wisdom, discipline, compassion, understanding, and love.I have only one real quibble with the film, and it is one that only comic book fans would understand or care about. The film continues the sorry tradition of ignoring the work of Bill Finger in the creation and development of Batman. Finger created the personalities, technology, settings, and most of the characters that made Batman unique. He did so without receiving the credit he was due. Bob Kane continues to receive sole credit, despite producing little work over the course of the life of Batman. Finger and artist Jerry Robinson provided most of the work, in those early days, while Kane got all of the credit. Where Kane's true genius lies, is in securing a deal which gave him sole credit for so many years, for other people's work. By all rights, the movie titles should read 'Batman created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.' Does this detract from the movie? No; but, since the film is about justice versus revenge, it's the right thing to do.",9,5,8,17 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Sophomore effort shines as brightly as the first.
","After Fellowship, the world wondered if Peter Jackson could sustain the momentum. The Two Towers is the shortest segment and the story is split into parallel tales. More characters enter the story, including one of the most important. Can Jackson do it? Of course he can.Spoilers: Two Towers sustains the magic of Fellowship, while expanding the scope of the story. Gollum enters the picture, in full view not shadow, and is a triumph to behold.The story cuts back and forth between Merry and Pippin's encounter with Treebeard and the Ents; Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn and their attempts to locate the hobbits and free them; and Sam Frodo and Gollum as they move closer to Mordor. Each aspect is well covered, without losing track of the other story. Rohan provides the setting for the first great battle (aside from the prologue in Fellowship) and what a battle it is. Gandalf returns, much changed from his encounter with the balrog. The evil of Wormtongue appears, and Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer take the stage.There are many great moments, from the mounted battles to Gollum and Smeagol's dialogue, Legolas' surf archery to Theoden's cure. Helm's Deep is a spectacular segment that takes one back to the epic films of the past. Darkness looms for Frodo and Sam, as Frodo slips deeper under the spell of the ring. He finds new, and sometimes strange, allies; as well as new foes. His journey becomes more difficult with each step.The quality of the production continues. The Rohirrum are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost Anglo-Saxons. The battle scenes are engaging and terrifying. War is depicted with all of its consequences. Your heart is torn as you see the young separated from their parents, innocents are killed, and destruction abounds. At the same time, strength and hope come to those in desperate need and courage comes in the unlikeliest of moments. You find yourself in the lowest depths, as all seems lost; and then your heart soars, as hope comes at the last moment. This is storytelling at its finest.This is not a sequel, it is another chapter in an epic saga. As such, it builds on the previous chapter and advances the story. The pace quickens as the conflict rises. The stakes are higher and the danger greater. The audience is on the edge of their seat, as darkness looms, while the threads of hope begin to weave together. The stage is set for the final battle.",Null,11,12,7 January 2005
The Incredibles," Best superhero movie ever!
","Pixar continues its winning streak, with an assist from Brad Bird, director of the wonderful Iron Giant. This time, we have a superhero family story, ala the Fantastic Four, plus some nice homages to James Bond and Jonny Quest.Spoilers: Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are retired superheroes, raising their kids in the suburbs. Bob (Mr Incredible) works for an insurance company, but longs for the old days. Helen (Elastigirl) has her hands full with the kids. Son Dash has super speed and a personality to match. Daughter Violet creates force fields and can turn invisible, which matches her shy nature. Baby Jack-Jack does what babies do.A secret benefactor offers Bob a chance to relive the glory days; but, all is not what it seems. It will take the entire family to save the day.The film features the dazzling computer animation we have come to expect from Pixar, but they have added subtle nuances. Human characters are the hardest to render, especially with realistic hair and expressions. The Incredibles features new triumphs in character animation. The colors are dazzling and the effects are stunning.The characters are brought to life vocally by Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L Jackson, and Jason Lee. Nelson brings an everyman quality to Bob, while Hunter shows flair for both the spectacular and the mundane. Wallace Shawn brings some Rex-mojo to a supporting role, while Jason Lee indulges his inner-Brody.The design is wonderful, with nods to Ken Adams' James Bond sets, Modern architecture and design, and a little Jonny Quest for good measure (spiders!). The music also hearkens back to the 60's jazzy sound, part John Barry, part Hoyt Curtain.This is the ultimate superhero film, replacing Superman and the X-Men. It remains to be seen if the upcoming Fantastic Four feature can live up to this; but, here's hoping for more adventures from the Incredibles.",Null,0,1,7 November 2004
Slap Shot," Ah, the 70's!
","Ah, the 70's!  What a weird decade it was.  This film brings back a lot of memories;from the god-awful clothes to the failing economy in an industrial town, to the loser local sports franchise.I grew up near an industrial town in the 70's and early 80's and this film brings back the memories of that time and place:  the depression and despondence brought on by the economy and the fact that your only sports team sucks!I'm not much of a hockey fan, but I love the games in this film.  The progression from a hapless team to carnival freaks is great fun.  Who doesn't love the Hanson brothers?  From the silly announcer to the crazed general manager to the team of losers, half-wits and just plain weirdos; this film adds new meaning to the term 'cast of characters'!Looking back on this film, you wonder how it happened.  Paul Newman in a hockey comedy?  Ralphie's mom (Melinda Dillon) topless?  The sheriff of 'Twin Peaks'?  That 'failure to communicate' guy? That was what made some of the films of the 70's great.  They weren't the predictable fare we see today.  Big stars weren't above making character movies or just having some plain old, goofy fun.  What other decade gave you Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and Superman?This film is still a lot of fun, and if it seems dated, it's only because you didn't live through that time.  And given the current economic climate and fashion, it still looks pretty timely.",Null,0,2,10 December 2002
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Stands on its own merit, still prefer the original
","I'll admit upfront that I grew up with and love the original Willie Wonka. I was prepared to dismiss this film, except for two things: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. That combination has always resulted in interesting, if not great films. I was pleasantly surprised to find the new film entertaining, though no more faithful to the source material than the original.Depp is fun as the off-kilter Wonka, playing him as a wonderful eccentric, much like Ed Wood. I could have done without the ridiculous unresolved father issue (shades of Spielberg!), but it was nice to see Christopher Lee. Freddie Highmore is good as Charlie, capturing the right note of honesty and wonder. The rest of the kids are fine, but don't quite compare to the original cast. Julie Dawn Cole is still the ultimate Veruca Salt. Francesca Hunt was waisted as Mrs. Salt. Her background facial expressions were wonderful, but she should have had lines. James Fox was fine, but I miss Roy Kinnear. David Kelly was fantastic. He has been a favorite of mine since I saw him in Fawlty Towers.The convention that Deep Roy is the sole Oompa-Loompa works well and he is a great performer. However, the musical pieces just don't have the same flair as the original. Oh, they're entertaining, but they lack that magical sparkle.Visually, the film is a treat and the advances in effects works allow it to look better than the original, but I still felt the candy room in the original was more awe-inspiring. Here, it looked too artificial. The design was good, but it seemed a bit lifeless.On the whole, the film is very entertaining, with some nice moments. The younger generation will probably have a greater love for it than people of my generation, but there is much to love for us old fogies. It lacks the charm of the original, and the sense that the unexpected could happen at any moment. Still, it looks great and keeps your attention. The performances range from adequate to great, with no real bad turns. The inclusion of Charlie's father is nice, and the squirrels are welcome. If only Burton could have spent less time focusing on the bizarre and more on the charm of the story, it would have been so much better. Roald dahl is still a tricky author to capture on screen. Kids will love the film and adults will find much to please them, as well.",7,0,1,20 May 2006
Major League," 'Juuust a bit outside.'
","Let me preface this by saying I can't stand baseball; I find it to be one of the most boring sports out there.  With that said, I love this film. It has a great 'underdog' story, some genuine comedy, great characters, and heart. It's a minor film, but it's thoroughly entertaining.  If more films could just be entertaining, I might go to the theater more often.The heart of this film is the characters.  We have the broken down veterans, the rookies, the love interest, the wise old coach, and the villain.   These are rather cliched characters, but they are written and performed so well, you don't notice.  Much of the humor arises out of character moments, which keeps it from becoming tired or dated.Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen were hot, coming off of the success of Platoon.  Corbin Bernsen was enjoying fame on LA Law.  Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes were relative unknowns who got a chance to shine.  And then there's Bob Uecker!  Uecker is the glue that brings everything together and he gets the best lines in the movie.You can't go wrong with a film like this.  Everything works well and a good time is had by all. Too bad the sequels forgot what made this a success.",Null,8,13,28 July 2003
Rocky," Still the champion
","In 1976, a minor actor took a shot at creating something for himself and scored a knockout.  It's hard to remember; but, at this stage of his career, Sylvester Stallone was a relative unknown.  He had a small part in a Woody Allen film, and minor success in the movie The Lords of Flatbush.  The studio took a chance on a script from this minor actor and sat stunned as it became a huge success.  Gee, kind of sounds like the plot of the movie!Rocky was not only the quintessential boxing movie, it was also the story of a man reaching for his dreams; and a surprisingly tender love story. Stallone was tailor-made for this part and he brings many layers to it. People often underestimate Stallone's intelligence and talent because of his voice and some of his career choices.  Rocky showed a Stallone with tremendous skills and promise.  Unfortunately, Stallone seemed to be more like Rocky at the beginning of the third film: living it up and taking the easy fights.  When Stallone is challenged, like in Cop Land, he can surprise you.The film is filled with great character performances, including Burgess Meredith as the cranky trainer Mick, and Burt Young as the course, but caring Pauley.  Carl Weathers' Apollo is a cinematic Ali and makes a great contrast to Stallone's Rocky.This movie is as much about emotion as it is about achieving your dreams. It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, of happiness andÂ pain.  The soundtrack was everything that a movie score should be: if there were no dialogue or pictures, it could tell the story.  it ebbs and flows in time with the story.  It starts out slowly and builds and builds; and then swells to the emotional climax.  Your heart starts pumping along with it.The movie gave us it's famous and often copied training montages.  They've become cliched, but they work so well in these movies.  We see Rocky struggle to build himself into the challenger.  With each step, he grows stronger and more confident.  In the end, he is standing tall.Unfortunately, Stallone went to the well one too many times.  He did the same with the Rambo films.  The first three Rocky's make a fine trilogy: The challenger who goes for the title and misses it by a hair, the rematch and the struggle to find the one element needed to capture the gold, and the downfall of the new champion and the rediscovery of what it took to rise to the top.  After that, the series is reduced to jingoism and caricature.  The same is true for Rambo.  In First Blood, he is a weary and lost veteran who is pushed to the breaking point.  In the subsequent films, he is just a cartoon supersoldier, blowing up tanks and helicopters with arrows and fighting armies alone.There is talk of yet another Rocky and Rambo.  Hopefully, Stallone will let them stay retired and look for something more challenging.  You can never recapture lightning in a bottle.  You have to be satisfied with your accomplishment and move on to the next challenge.  This movie cannot be topped.",Null,0,0,6 April 2003
Thor," Fine adaptation, entertaining film.
","So, next up from the Marvel Comics pantheon is Thor, or the Mighty Thor as he was known to fans (or Goldilocks, as he was to Ben Grimm). Here, we have a tale of Norse gods filtered through a lens of superheroes. Thor is the arrogant son of Odin, ruler of Asgard, and the time has come for him to take the throne. At his side is his brother (half brother in mythology, bit more complicated here) Loki, the trickster god. Everything looks hunky-dory, until a commando team of frost giants enters Asgard to try to take back their power source (we get a Lord of the Rings-style history lesson into the Asgardians and the frost giants, as well as the relation to myth). Thor, defying his father (and with a bit of easy prodding by Loki) goes of looking for answers as to why the FG's have broken the truce; or, more precisely, to kick some ice. Thor and his buddies indulge in a bit of mayhem and are rescued when the frost hits the fan, and a lecture from pop. Dad is so mad he grounds Thor, literally, exiling him to our world (if our world had armored billionaires, green-skinned monsters, and we fought HYDRA in World War II). There, we indulge in some fish-out-of-water hijinks, a bit of puppy love, some violence, and we're off to the races.Kenneth Brannagh proves to be the correct director for something as grandiose as Thor. Marvel's Thor, as shaped by Jack Kirby, was a world of hyperbole, a kind of Hell's Kitchen version of Wagner, with Stan Lee's pseudo-Shakesperean dialogue. Brannagh knows how to handle the real Bard and keeps things from getting too silly, drawing theatrical performances from the Asgardians, while keeping the mortals grounded. He treads a fine line but keeps it believable. These things are all about action and plot, but Brannagh keeps the focus on characters and relationships, so the film doesn't devolve into a video game, like films featured in the previews on my DVD.The cast is good, with Chris Hemmsworth making for a fine Thor, but Tom Hiddleston (a colleague of Brannagh's, from the Wallander series) shines as the devious Loki, giving real emotions to the trickster, not making him a cackling cliché. The mortals serve their purpose, but Natalie Portman has about as much meat here as she does in the Star Wars films and seems a bit wasted. Kat Dennings adds some nice comic touches, while Stellan Skarsgard provides the Scandanavian angle, though he gets a couple of good scenes. The Warriors Three get a bit lost, since they don't really get a chance to build their characters, though they get some quick action against the Destroyer.As is fitting for a Marvel character, the film cribbs from other sources, most notably, Superman II, with the Destroyer scenes (one can almost hear Terence Stamp calling the place Planet Houston), though Thor himself cribbed liberally from Superman and Captain Marvel, back in the Silver Age. There's plenty of nods to the Lord of the Rings, itself a byproduct of the Norse Eddas and a bit of Wagner. There is nothing earthshattering her, but its all handled in a pleasant and entertaining manner, which befits a film drawn from light entertainment.I can quibble with many minor things, like the relative lack of Thor's trademark helmet (which here looks more like Mike Grell's Warlord than Kirby's Thor), or that the 'romance' seems to evolve rather quickly (gods are busy beings); but, not enough to dislike the film. It isn't high art but 'low art' has its place in the world (and often has greater impact, without all of the snobbery) and so does this. If you want to see how bad this could have been, just check out Dolph Lundgren in He-Man, which swiped wholesale from the works of Kirby.Fans will be happy to see the characters, the easter eggs (Cosmic Cube and other objects, nods to Hulk and Iron Man, etc...), the cameos (Stan Lee and writer Joe Straczynski, but no Walt Simonson, alas...) and the general tone of things. Non-fans get some thrills and entertainment, without needing to read 40+ years worth of comics or a graduate course in mythology.In the end, Thor is a fun film, with a mostly satisfying conclusion, despite the need to set up Captain America and the Avengers. There is a nice James Bond touch in the credits, which shows that Marvel is using the right template for light action movies, and a nice nod to some of the creators of Thor (including Walt and Weesie Simonson, who handled the character best, even taking into account the King). Those who want to find fault with the casting or story can't see the film for what it is. Marvel's Thor is not Norse mythology (despite the names and some of the trappings), nor is it the Ring of the Niebelung. It's a blond guy swinging a hammer around, while his brother plots against him. That's more than enough.",Null,0,1,15 September 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not perfect, but much closer to the originals
","As a long time fan of Star Wars, (but not a rabid fanatic) I have looked forward to this chapter, more than any other. From the moment Darth Vader set foot on the Rebel ship in Star Wars (I refuse to use the episode title) he captured my imagination. Hints given by Lucas in interviews added fuel, as did other media appearances. Now, I get to see how it all transpired. However, given the dramatic content of the previous two installments, I entered the theater with a healthy dose of skepticism. The final verdict: nearly there, but not perfect.The problem with the prequels is that it is hard to live up to 28 years (man, I feel old!) of imagination. I've also grown cynical as to how much of the story was really mapped out in advance. Given the contradictions that carry through the entire series, I firmly believe that Lucas had more of a sketchy outline, than a blueprint. I think that is why the prequels don't hold up as well.With all of that said, did I find the movie entertaining? Yes, absolutely; but, there was still too much incidental padding. The Clone Wars never seems to have the scope it was given by a few mentions in the original films and other media works. It just seems to be a thin metaphor for Palpatine's consolidation of power. Also, the opening sequence smacks too much of eye candy and James Bond storytelling (big opening with little relation to the story). Much of the dialogue is still stilted and laughable, although chills ran down my spine as Natalie Portman said, 'So this is how Liberty dies, with thunderous applause.' It bears a strong relationship to world events and the Patriot Act.The much-touted addition of the Wookies amounts to little more than a cameo, as does Christopher Lee's presence (Lee seems to have really bad luck when it comes to part 3 of a saga). Yoda's battle with the Emperor lacks a suitable conclusion; not that I wanted to see him win, but his withdrawal from the battle seemed forced and illogical.Now, what does work is the work of Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor, and to a certain extent, Natalie Portman. They finally get some meat to their roles and they sink their teeth into it. Palpatine's seduction of Anakin is almost Shakespearean, and shows the true power of the Emperor. McGregor moves beyond caricature to performance, and shows great emotional range. Portman's role is reduced to reaction, but she has enough moments to bring out the magic she had in the Professional. Hayden Christiansen is much improved, but doesn't seem capable of portraying the conflicting emotions well. He still seems unable to play a range of emotions with his expressions; and, although not 'whiny', he still seems more of a spoiled brat, than a corrupted soul. He gains some spark during the final battle, particularly after the final stroke, but needed more work on his performance.Lucas still proves that he is better with concepts than with performances. His best movie, from a performance aspect, is still American Graffiti. There, he had seasoned actors and real life drama, so it was easier for the actors to create a performance. Still, it is a vast improvement over the previous installments.The bridging sequences at the finale are a nice nod to the fans of the original series. There is a strong connection to the images and emotions of Star Wars. The one element I still wanted to see was Han Solo's past. Maybe that will be pursued in the proposed TV series, or future prose works (previous books have eluded to incidents, but haven't illustrated the key moments, such as Han's expulsion from the Imperial Navy).Ultimately, the film is a success and does unify the previous films into a more coherent story (although Ep I is mostly padding and introduction). It casts the original series in a new light, not as the story of Luke Skywalker as the liberator of the Galaxy; but, the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker. It still has plot holes you could drive a Star Destroyer through, but it still inspires and entertains.",7,1,1,27 May 2005
The Queen," Excellent film!
","The Queen is a masterful piece of cinema. The performances are true examples of character work, with Helen Mirren and Micheal Sheen transforming themselves into Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair. As I watched the film, I forgot I was watching the same actress who played Jane Tennison and Morgan Le Faye, and felt like I was watching the actual Queen. I have always enjoyed Mirren's work, but she really produced a masterpiece here.The film really captures the events of the time, but gives them a new, human perspective. at the time, as an American, I felt the whole thing was a rather gross spectacle; but, you get a different perspective here. Director Frears skillfully blends archival footage with filmed scenes, allowing you to see behind the news footage. You come to understand the Queen and prince Charles' perspectives more. It's also amazing to watch Sheen as Blair. He is elected as a modernizer, someone who would seem to want to do away with the anachronism of the monarchy; yet he seems to fall under the spell after he meets the Queen, one-on-one. He comes to understand her perspective, the role she plays, and the events that shaped her life and character.At times, I watched the film and again wondered why the British put up with this institution and the insanity that seems to surround it; but then I realize that Americans do the same thing, with politicians, celebrities and sports figures. They cease to be people to us and become icons. The monarch represents the living history of Britain. It's a fascinating idea that the film captures well.The film is one of the best I have seen in some years and Mirren has won every accolade. As of this writing, it appears that the announcement of her Oscar is the surest bet since the outcome of Rocky 2, and deservedly so. Mirren pulls off a true piece of character acting; she literally becomes the Queen. Michael Sheen deserved an equal nomination for his portrayal of Blair, but was snubbed. The rest of the cast acquit themselves with considerable skill, as well; with Helen McCrory getting some of the best lines and scenes, as Cherie Blair.The film has many fine moments and draws real emotion from the audience. For me, the most moving scene is when the Royal Family are outside Buckingham Palace, viewing the the mound of flowers and cards. Mirren's reactions give you a sense of how Queen Elizabeth must have truly felt. The moment that she asks the little girl if she wants her to place her flowers with the others, and the girl says '..no, these are for you,' brought tears to my eyes. Mirren is so visibly touched by such a small but honest expression. it is not manipulated, but emerges from truth, the best form of drama.This is a film and a performance that is worth seeing and studying, particularly for an aspiring actor.",10,1,2,27 January 2007
Blade Runner," Future Noir
","The title of Paul Sammon's excellent book about the making of Blade Runner, Future Noir, sums up the film best.  In style, it bears a strong resemblance to the great works of film noir; but, with a new technological twist to it. We have your hard boiled private eye/cop sent to solve a case, characters who aren't what they seem, moral dilemmas, corruption, passionate but dangerous affairs, dark atmosphere, decay, depravity, and paranoia.  In short, all the ingredients of Chandler, Cain, and Thompson.Ridley Scott, by this point, had made a name as a visual stylist.  His films were amazing to look at, even if they weren't exactly showcases for great acting.  What kept them from becoming total visual exercises was the casting of fine actors.  Here again, he assembled a fine cast, but the visual elements dominate the film.  The actors do their best with the difficult, often confusing material; but, ultimately, they are merely another component of a cinematic painting.  It's not surprising, given that Scott had been a graphic artist.The design of the film owes some debt to films such as Metropolis and Just Imagine, the architectural drawings of Hugh Ferris, the city scenes of Tokyo, the work of Moebius, and the art of Edward Hopper and the futurist designers and graphic artists.  Conceptual artist Syd Mead provided blueprints that Scott and company built upon and added layer after layer. DVD technology allows you to linger on each detail, taking in all those elements you couldn't see in the theater, but helped to complete the picture.  Every piece of paper, every photo, sign, and magazine cover was created to add depth and character to this world.  In fact, the city is the strongest character of the film.Much has been made of the number of replicants, whether Deckard is a replicant (is Holden also a replicant?), the nature of humanity, the role of animals, and many other themes and questions relating to the film.  The beauty of the film to its fans (and major criticism from its detractors) is that so much is left open to interpretation.  It's a film you can watch again and again and discover new ideas, or look at them from a new angle. When I first saw the film, the idea that Deckard was a replicant never entered my mind.  After reading Sammon's book, I watched the film again, both the original theatrical release and the 'director's cut' and noticed the subtle hints for the first time.  The glowing light in the eyes never appeared deliberate before; I just assumed it was a reflection of the lights.  After reading the book, I noticed that it only occurs in certain situations.The performances vary in quality.  Even the so-so actors have their interesting moments; but some are stronger than others.  The cold, dismal atmosphere of this film doesn't lend itself to a variety of emotions, so the performances tend to come off as limited.  The replicants are more alive than the humans, possibly due to their short lifespan.  They seem compelled to get as much living in as possible.  As such, the replicant actors are more interesting, if not more skilled than the humans.  Rutger Hauer is all over the place:  he is menacing, laughable, haunted, distraught, psychotic, reflective, and destructive.  Darryl Hannah, Brion James, and Joanna Cassady provide less rounded performances; but they are effective, in a quirky manner.Harrison Ford brings a Chandleresque weariness to Deckard, a man who hates his life but is trapped by it.  The more he is in contact with the replicants, the more his humanity comes out.  It is not his best performance, but it exceeds more recent work.Sean Young is a bit of a dilemma, she looks good, but she doesn't bring much to her role; but that is the nature of the character.  So, is the flaw her acting, the direction, or the script?  On one level, it is perfect for an artificial character whose life is an empty shell.  On the other hand, it is frustrating as she never seems to rise to the moment.The Vangellis music is another source of polarization.  I personally love a lot of synthesizer driven music of this era, while many have nothing but derision for it.  To me, the synthesizer gives a voice to technology and helps animate it.  Given that the city and technology of this world acts as another character, the music acts as that character's dialogue.  I wouldn't want this type of music in a period piece or a comedy, but it works within the framework of this film.Ultimately, this is a film that either challenges you or turns you away. It stirs the imagination with its detail, and its omission of detail.  You are often left to fill in missing elements.  On some levels, this can be frustrating and probably the source of much derision for the film.   On the other hand, it can be extremely stimulating to the mind and take you places that you never dreamed.  It is not a prefect film, but it is an important one, from a design sense and a thematic one.",Null,0,1,6 May 2004
Bull Durham," Funny, nostalgic, moving, and sexy.
","There was a time when you saw a constellation of stars turn into the logo for Orion Pictures.  When you saw that, you knew (usually) you were in for a good time.  For a brief, but wonderful time, Orion Pictures signified great movies.  This was one of them.Bull Durham is a wonderfully romantic look at the world of minor league baseball and relationships.  Director Ron Shelton presented a loving tribute to his days as a ballplayer and the men who played with him.  He also presented one of the most interesting love triangles and some of the most romantic and sexyist love scenes ever put on celluloid.Everyone is great in this.  Costner is the aging ballplayer just trying to hang on until it's time to hang up his cleats.  Susan Sarandon is the existential groupie who molds young players, but falls hard for the veteran. Tim Robbins is the rookie who learns about the game and life from both. Add great supporting performances from Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl, as well as the rest of the team.The film has endured well because the emotion and relationships that are the center of it hold true.  It's not just a baseball movie.  It's a coming of age story, a romance, and the end of a chapter in life.  It is warm, funny, loving, and oh so entertaining.It's interesting to watch the dvd and listen to the commentary track from Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins. It is quite entertaining, but, when the film reaches Costner and Sarandon's love scenes, Robbins gets very quiet, and Costner becomes very uncomfortable trying to cover the silence.  Robbins' comment that they haven't shown this film to their kids brings a bit of a chuckle.  How do you explain Dad with another woman at the beginning and Mom with another man at the end?  Probably one of the more unique parenting dilemas.Watch this film.  It is one for the ages.",Null,0,1,28 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," An excellent film, sequel or not.
","X2, or X-Men 2, if you like, would be an outstanding film, even if it weren't a sequel.  You do not need the first film to enjoy this one, but it does add flavor and detail.  The story is good, and the characters do get their moments to shine, although sheer weight of numbers undercuts some of the focus.The original cast picks up where they left off, with Halle Berry getting a stronger role (Oscar influence, no doubt) and Hugh Jackman continues to dominate.  The Rogue/Iceman romance gets a little more development, but gets lost in the third act.There are plenty of new additions to the cast, the most welcome are Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, Nightcrawler; and Brian Cox as William Stryker. Cumming continues his scene stealing streak in movies as the outcast Nightcrawler, a mutant who can't hide what he is.  He carries a devout faith that sees him through his troubles.  Stryker, in contrast, carries a deep hatred that drives his actions.  Where Senator Kelley feared mutants (in the first film), Stryker wants to see them destroyed.Bryan Singer has again done justice to one of the most popular and complex comics of the more recent era.  He has distilled the finer points of the X-Men lore into the framework of the film, but has given it a unique cinematic showcase.  The film can be enjoyed by longtime fans and newcomers, who have no idea that Wolverine is missing his mask.SpoilersWhile Wolverine is in Canada, searching for clues to his past, the president is attacked in the Oval Office.  Stryker uses this emergency to set in motion an attack on Xavier's school.  The X-Men must regroup and stop Stryker.  Wolverine learns more about his past, and something is happening to Jean Grey.The film nicely sows the seeds for the next film, one that if comes to fruition, may make X-Men fans very happy.  Even if it doesn't, we have a nice pair in these X films.There are some nice nods to the comic fans, some very subtle, some quite overt.  Hopefully, some will be explored in the future, possibly by Bryan Singer. Either way, this is worth the price of admission.",Null,0,0,3 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A satisfying end to a great saga
","With The Return of the King, Peter Jackson caps off the greatest saga in film history. Forget Star Wars, there are no ewok moments here. This is the final chapter in an epic tale and it is told with all of the skill of the previous chapters, and then some.Spoilers: Frodo and Sam have reached Mordor and must face not only the treachery of Gollum and the spreading disease of the ring, but the full might of Sauron's realm. Gandalf and Pippin must flee to Gondor, where they enter the heart of the conflict. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Merry must lead the men of Rohan to aid Gondor. Through it all, the little hobbits demonstrate courage and strength beyond their size.The siege of Gondor is a wonder to behold. It takes the drama of Helm's Deep and expands it exponentially. The battle comes in many stages, with triumphs and tragedies, much like real combat. Jackson continues to show that even just wars have their prices. Eowyn gets her chance to prove her worth on the field of battle, while Theoden finds the glory he had lost. Sam demonstrates that this is as much his story as it is Frodo's.ROTK is the longest of all the films, yet never seems to stand still. The characters once again get their moments and earn the final pay-off. Sean Astin really steps forward as Sam, as he becomes Frodo's engine, propelling him to the end. Gollum is refined and shows that his part is more than villainy. John Noble is a delight to watch as he portrays Denethor's madness. Bernard Hill and Viggo Mortensen get to deliver rousing speeches and truly act as Kings. Miranda Otto gets to engage in the fight, while Merry and Pippin move beyond comedy.Once again, every aspect of production is in service of the story, and what memorable service it is. Weta has become the ILM of the 21st Century, while showing Hollywood how effects should be used. The writing proves that great literature can be adapted to film, if respect is shown to the source. Peter Jackson shows that he is a storyteller first, which all great directors must be. Howard Shore brings back the epic score; one that can stand alone, yet always supports the scene at hand.This film won every accolade and deservedly so. Yes, the Oscars were really for the entire saga, not just this film; but, the Lord of the Rings is one story, comprised of three segments. It is fitting that the rewards come at the end of the story.The Lord of The Rings proved that fantasy literature could be adapted to film and adapted well. It showed that great acting can be had in a genre film. It showed that special effects can enhance a story, without just being eye candy. It demonstrated that good storytelling will always connect with the audience. It is a masterpiece worthy of a classic work of literature.",Null,2,4,7 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic in every sense of the word.
","I still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of Star Wars.  It was a trailer shown on tv.  I knew nothing about the movie at that point; and, thus, got many wrong ideas.  There was a quick cut between Luke and Leia swinging across the chasm in the Death Star and an extreme closeup of Darth Vader's face, from the cell interrogation scene.  Also, there were shots of stormtroopers falling into a pit.  I thought Vader was a giant and Luke and Leia were swinging away from him and the stormtroopers were fighting in some city and fell off a ledge.  Boy did I have a lot to learn!  Now, you must understand; this was the era of Sinbad films and Star Trek in syndication only.  The closest thing to sci-fi in the movies were films like The Land That Time Forgot.  2001 was shown when I was a baby and Silent Running was unknown to me.I didn't get to see the film right away.  First, I saw the three issues of the comic book that Marvel Comics released before the film. Unfortunately, they waited a while to release the other three.  Next, I read the novel. Then, I saw a 'making of' special on tv.  I was now champing at the bit to see this film.  All of my friends had seen it, there were pictures everywhere.  When, Lord?  When will it be my turn?  Finally, my parents took my siblings and I to see it.I sat there with wide eyes as the opening title crawl stretched across the screen.  Then, my jaw dropped as the Star Destroyer flew across the screen and kept growing and growing.  I had chills down my spine when Darth Vader entered Leia's ship.  I smiled as Ben Kenobi dispatched troublemakers and Han shot Geedo under the table.  Man, this movie has everything!  The Death Star was awe-inspiring.  The actors went from one cliffhanger to the next. The ligthsabre battle was thrilling and the escape breathtaking.  My heart was pounding through the dog fights just waiting for that shot; and then........ BOOM!  Bye-bye Death Star.  The audience was cheering, the cast was cheering, the producers were cheering!  I had to see this again, and again,.....and again.No amount of criticism will ever dampen this movie for me.  No changes in special effects or addition of scenes, or ill-conceived prequels will change the experiences this film gave me the first time.  It was magical, mythical, wonderful, exciting, creative, and just plain fun.  To a large number of my generation, this was THE film.  It was a shared experience.  It tapped into something primordial in us.  It was hard to articulate.  Was it the fairy tale story; the battle of good and evil?  The cool effects and space battles?  The great characters?  The cheesy, but sincere dialogue?  Was it the optimism it brought in a dark time (post-Vietnam and Watergate)?  Or was it just, so cool?  It was all of these, none of these, and so much more. It was our myth, our saga; it was ours.  And the rest of the world joined in.I saw the Special Editions and the prequels; but the changes are artificial. The original version is the reality.  I know Lucas says that the Special Editions will be the only versions available, and there are rumors of scenes to be retrofitted in the fabled DVD release, but I would like to just have the original film, warts and all, as it was.  Maybe with the deleted scenes on a supplemental disc and commentary from Lucas and the cast.  OK, George; we're waiting.",Null,0,0,8 February 2003
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Delivers over-the-top fun, the way that Bond used to.
","When I heard that Miark Millar's comic, The Secret Service (with artist Dave Gibbons, of Watchmen fame), was being turned into a movie, I had a pretty good idea of what we wood get: a lot of vulgar language, over-the-top violence, and a decent plot. What surprised me was how much felt like a tribute to the glory years of James Bond, far more than anything from Eon and MGM. It revels in what made Bond great fun, while adding a modern spin. It also pokes fun at the often pompous, upper class world of Bond and espionage fiction (and reality) and doesn't take itself too seriously. It is vulgar and ridiculously violent, though the violence does tend to be more in service to the story than some of Millar's other work.Mathew Vaughn direct; unsurprising, after Kick-Ass; but, as he showed in the early segments of X-Men: First Class, he gets spy-fi and delivers it well. He's not too overboard with the jump cuts and does let you soak up some of the screen, before throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you. I do wish he would slow things down a bit, here and there; but, it's a modern film world.Colin Firth is the linchpin that holds the film together and presents us with a cross between James Bond and John Steed, either of whom he would have played wonderfully. In fact, I wish we had a time machine and take Vaughn and Firth back and redo The Avengers (the Ralph Finnes and Uma thurman one, not Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the rest). Michael Caine provides a nice tribute to the golden days, as Harry Palmer's glasses also seem to figure into the formula, while Caine gets to play the toff (though his accent slips in his last scene). Vaughn brings back Mark Strong to show why he is greatly under-appreciated in Hollywood (the man is a great actor and has been since at least Prime Suspect 3). Taron Egerton makes an excellent young Eggy, while Sophie Cookson is the capable, but self-doubting Roxy. On the bad guy's side we have Samuel L. Jackson, as a sort of Richard Branson crossed with Bill Gates and Russell Simmons, with a dash of megalomania. he is aided by his henchperson, Sophia Boutella, as Gazelle, the most memorable sidekick/assassin since Oddjob. All do a wonderful job.This has just about everything I felt had been missing from Bond, for years (even before Daniel Craig and the serious tone): a great villain, plenty of action and intrigue, a sense of humor, and a sense of danger. Modern Bond has the danger and intrigue, but has lost the sense of humor and the sheer fun of a super-agent. There hasn't been a memorable Bond villain in years, yet Samuel L Jackson delivered a great gonzo billionaire, where Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce struggled.I can quibble about a few things; some of the violence would be better left to the imagination and the language really doesn't add much; but, on the whole, those are minor criticisms. The characters are engaging, the plot is entrancing and the action is well staged and rarely gratuitous. This is pure cinematic fun, with a dose of brainpower. I can't wait for more.",8,6,10,26 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 'Wars not make one great.'
","The best of the Star Wars films and the most mature. Lucas was greatly aided by the writing of Lawrence Kasdan and the direction of Irvin Kershner.  The characters have grown and so has the story.  The tone is darker and more exciting; and, even though this has a cliff-hanger ending, the main elements are resolved by the end.Thankfully, George let other people play in his sandbox this time.  Lucas showed great promise in American Graffiti and shepherded Star Wars, but he doesn't have the same ability with actors as he does with the more technical elements.  According to Harrison Ford, his direction usually consisted of 'faster, and more intense.'  Kershner is a more seasoned director and was able to draw out the performances from the actors.Kasdan adds greater depth to the story by introducing a romantic element to Han and Leia's relationship, while bringing Vader to the foreground.  Plus, we have the new character of Yoda to dazzle us.  Frank Oz is able to bring life to this muppet and delivers one of the best performances; although it was weird hearing Grover's voice in a Star Wars film!This is the model that Lucas should have followed for the later films, but didn't.  As a result, the ending of this trilogy falls flat and the prequels are shallow and unengaging.  Maybe if Lucas had ceded more control in the creative process, the results would have been better.  Regardless, this film stands as a testament to his and his cast and crew's vision.",Null,0,1,19 June 2003
Sin City," More hard boiled than a 90 minute egg!
","Frank Miller's Sin City series of graphic novels are stark tales of hard boiled men, tough dames, nasty villains, corrupt cops, and steely-eyed killers. It was inspired by the works of Jim Thompson, James M. Cain, Mickey Spillane, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler; film noir, and the works of Bernard Kriegsten. They are told in black and white, with occasional splashes of color, in an almost impressionistic style. Miller made a name for himself working on costumed heroes, like Daredevil and Batman, instilling them with his love of crime fiction. When he created his own stories, he left the costumes behind and went full-tilt noir.Sin City, the movie, perfectly captures the look and tone of Miller's stories, with identical staging and the use of stark contrast in lighting. There are flashes of color, which have greater impact after the noirish scenery. The violence is over the top, in keeping with the comic origins. The characters look the part and the world exists in its own time and place.The dialogue is pure Miller and sounds like it could have been spoken by Bogart or Cagney. That does present a slight problem, after years of more realistic dialogue in crime dramas. However, the actors deliver it with conviction, although it is a bit shaky in the opening scenes. It gets better as the film progresses. Much of it is delivered as monologue voice-over, in keeping with the traditions.Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are the stand-outs, both able to convincing deliver the dialogue and carry the character. They dominate their scenes, although they have the best material to work from. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro are good, but their segment is a bit weaker. The various actresses perform their parts well, but the women of Sin City are a bit lacking in depth. There are no Barbara Stanwycks here.Robert Rodriguez has captured the look and feel of the source well. The use of digital imagery captures the noir look, without the need for complex sets and lighting. However, it does tend to give everything an artificial aura. Real noir presented a harsh, fantastic world, but it always had substance. Despite advances in technology, the human eye still detects the artifice of CGI.Overall, the film is quite entertaining, although extremely violent. This is not a date movie (unless your idea of romance is Natural Born Killers). It is modern noir, with the cynicism, corruption, depravity and vice. It's also a hell of a ride! The film is being compared to Pulp Fiction, but they are two different entities. Tarrantino's was a slicked-up homage to pulp storytelling; this is pure pulp. So, grab your favorite coat, a pack of smokes, a blue-steeled automatic, and enter the chiaroscuro world of Sin City.",Null,0,2,2 April 2005
The Breakfast Club," When teen films had something to say
","Remember when teen films had something to say?  The 80's had an abundance of teen films, some good, many bad.  The current millenium has a slew of films aimed at teens, but they aren't really about teens.  John Hughes made films about teenagers; whether it was the angst they felt, or a bunch of goofy scenes.  His films are a mixed bag, often trying to blend comedy and drama, with mixed results.  The stock company of actors lent a sameness to them, but they were still on a higher plane then most of the other teen films.The Breakfast Club features a group of stereotypes, but there is truth there.  Every public school has a jock, a princess, a brain, a delinquent, and a basket-case.  In most films, that would be the sole aspect to the character.  Hughes actually tried to explain why these personality types exist and give them a three-dimensional personality.  The delinquent is the product of abuse and neglect.  The jock is driven by his father's dreams of athletic glory, not his own.  The brain must succeed at academics, a 'B' is unacceptable.  The princess is indulged by her father and used as a weapon for her parents arguments.  The basket-case is ignored and seeks attention. Now, you can debate whether the parents are to blame, or the children for using these excuses to behave the way they do.  Personally, I believe that the parents and the environment do play a major part in the development of these personalities.  Yes, the teens make conscious decisions, but those decisions are influenced heavily by the environment they have developed within.With a John Hughes film, you know you will hear some great dialogue and have some funny moments.  You will also run into some absurd events and coincidences.  For instance, when the kids are running through the school halls and nearly meet up with the administrator at ever turn.  The drama is often overplayed, a fault of both the director and the immature actors.  The actors are still developing their talents, and haven't learned restraint as well as they might.  The director should be the one to pull them back, but Hughes often fails in this task.Ultimately, this film is a bit uneven, but there is so much good, even great, material to be found in it. The performances overall strike the right cord.  The soundtrack is great and the setting used for great effect.  There is a lot of truth to be found here.  There are a lot of laughs and a few honest tears.  It's not perfect, but it's a darn good try.My only real problem with the film is this:  who gets detention on a Saturday?  No teacher, principal, dean, or school official is going to give up their Saturday to babysit some kids; and no parents are going to spend Saturday shuttling their kids to and from school.  Yeah, I know it's a device to get the kids together, without their peers around' but, come on!
One last note about John Hughes; the man knew how to put together a great soundtrack!  All of his films feature great music, especially to those of us whose musical tastes froze in the 80's.  Those were the days; when MTV actually showed videos, and they were worth watching.  Where there was some variety to the music there and on radio.  When a band could get some mileage out of one really great song.  Give me Wang Chung or the Police over Creed or Brittney Spears any day!",Null,0,1,3 May 2003
V for Vendetta," Good film, but a 'Cliffs Notes' version of the story.
","It is hard to comment on a rich story, such as V for Vendetta, within a 1,000 words. It is a story of ideas, filled with rich language and subtle nuances. It has iconic imagery and liberal use of symbolism. It presents deep political arguments and moral ambiguity. The film captures most of these themes, but in a more compact and simplistic version. It is faithful to segments of the story, but drastically alters the course of the tale.The acting is quite good, across the cast. Stephen Rea is a particular standout as Finch, the detective in pursuit of V. He is good man who has lost his way. He made choices that he thought were in the best interest of his society, but soon learns how wrong they were. Hugo Weaving is able to move beyond the limitations of a mask, using only voice and body language. Natalie Portman sports a dodgy accent, but conveys the innocence and growth of her character with skill. John Hurt provides a bit of irony, as he looms over video screens, like the Big Brother that tormented him in 1984. Stephen fry brings a touch of humor, some tragedy, and a large dose of humanity to the film.The film mostly captures the themes of the source, that true power in a society derives from the people, not the government. Totalitarian states rule through fear, and when the populace learns that it has nothing to fear from its government, it is able to tear it down and replace it with something better. It mostly ignores anarchy, as a political concept, but does capture the feelings of euphoria that come over the populace, when they are freed of surveillance and control. It shows that labels like 'terrorist' and 'freedom fighter' depend greatly on which side of a conflict you are on.Fans of the graphic novel will find the film a mixed bag: the basic themes are there, but the subtleties and depth is lacking. Those unfamiliar may find some of the ideas challenging, but worthy of discussion. The visuals are memorable and, generally, in service of the story. There is much greater depth than most recent 'genre' works, but there is much room for improvement. The film builds to a stirring climax, albeit a simplistic one. This is definitely a film that stirs discussion, and is very courageous and timely.",7,0,2,24 March 2006
