Casablanca," Î‘ Versatile Look Of War!
","I often find myself reading comments or reviews about a movie. A certain topic always seems to come up, 'You should watch a movie and have in mind the time it was made.'Some people agree and some people don't agree with the above statement. I happen to be on the first side and I have to admit. if you watch 'Casablanca', you may think that it's an other war-movie or you may be captured by the beauty of this movie and like it almost immediately.It's important though to have in mind the time when this movie first came out ( Whether you think it's important for a movie or not. ). 1942, the war was still in its peak. This movie, spotlights with the most beautiful of ways the circumstances of the war, the corruptness, the way people saw Nazi Germany and in the end, it lits a little spark of questioning ( Rarely executed subliminally well in movies. ): What is more important, oneself or the great good?I would recommend it, to anyone, who loves the essence of Cinema.",9,1,2,14 July 2015
Citizen Kane," Simple... But powerful!
","So I decided to write a review because I saw lot of people do wrong to this movie and others being a little unrealistic. The following is purely my opinion on the movie. I'll try not to go into much detail about the movie itself. Let's just think first when this movie was made, 1941. The story starts with Charles Foster Kane ( The protagonist. ) dying and breathing out his last words which were 'Rosebud'. So, from the beginning of the movie there's an enigma, what is 'Rosebud'? A journalist who'll write an article about the death of Kane tries to find the meaning of this word. So, with a lot of flashbacks and a flawless storytelling process we get to know who Kane was, where'd he come from. He's nature, he's good characteristics and his bad characteristics. We get a taste of how his life progressed. What I liked about Citizen Kane except from it's mystery and simplicity is how well we got to know our protagonist. By the end of this movie you may or may not understand what was the meaning of 'Rosebud'. I just have to suggest one thing, try and watch it. If you like it, you'll watch it again. If you don't, give it an another try and if you still don't like it then you never will. It's one of this movies that passed the test of time and still matter because in it's core, it's a movie about a human being. It was a classic 'must-see in your lifetime' movies that really lived up to their hype!",10,4,6,16 January 2015
