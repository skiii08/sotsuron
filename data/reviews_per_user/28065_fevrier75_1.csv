Mission: Impossible III," mission
","M:i:III' was the action we have been waiting for. In the TV series it was not difficult to predict the happy end, decorated with the prints of charm and intelligence.. I watched this movie with my 14 year old nephew and each time he asked me why he killed this man and than that women and the Chinese man on the towers and many others I had no answer.. Maybe, each time they were stuck, they chose to kill some instead of searching new solutions and thinking more, however, it was not easy to explain it to him.. So, I will be happy if some one would be so inclined to help me to find a logical explanation for a 14 year old boy..why did he kill all these people all around the world?",4,1,2,26 May 2006
