Scarface," Pointless
","When I first heard that Stone and Pacino were remaking Scarface I was intrigued. What did they think they could add to Paul Muni's Original? As soon as the movie came out, from the very first scene, I knew: nothing.The only thing the two movies had in common was the title. Why they had announced it as a remake was a mystery.So I sat back, now without expectation, to see what movie they had made.Throughout the screening I paid close attention to all of Scarface's elements, from cinematography to acting, and finally came to the conclusion that the only reason the movie was made was Stone's ego and Pacino's determination to prove how greatly he could ham it up.Scarface, despite its commercial success, is a manneristic disaster that never should have seen the light of a projector.I do not agree that any of its flaws are fatal - overacting, lack of story, pacing, poor cinematography have all been overcome in numerous movies.What made those movies was something to care about; Scarface lacks that quality. Tony Montana is a nonentity; Pacino's portrayal is not that of a independent character but of an 8-year-old's fantasy of being as bad as possible. In short, there is no Tony Montana - only Pacino playing out that fantasy.And this is a crime common to many, especially many successful, directors and actors. More common among the Europeans but spectacular when an American puts his ego above the audience.So Scarface is a movie about nothing and no one, punctuated with a great deal of equally pointless violence.Many have pointed out that Pacino's overacting and the extreme of carnage were meant to makes points, to portray the real-world carnage of the drug trade.Pardon me? There's no hint of reality in the movie. Pacino isn't portraying a low-life, low-class 'Gangsta'. Pacino's trying to achieve an epic ham. He succeeded so well that the character was left behind.My reason for writing this review now is a show I saw last night that traced Scarface's transformation from critical bomb to cult classic. One of the show's implication was that all the critics were wrong - I disagree for the reason listed above.As for cult status - fine, even if Plan 9 from Outer Space was a better movie.",1,23,48,3 March 2014
Inglourious Basterds," First of all, Pitt's accent ...
","Texas? Brooklyn? Midwestern? Couldn't tell but whatever it is irritated me greatly as an affectation.Then there's both plot and story - not so much as plot and story (fantasy is fantasy) but their presentation, which struck me as pretty much being on the same level of affectation as Pitt's accent.Same with script, cinematography, characters, soundtrack, acting and anything else I may have left off.Now I can see how one could see this as a ridiculously off the wall parody of a war/cum spy movie but, as such, it just irritated me - neither plot nor story made sense, none of the characters were engaging and none of the 'bits' - like the German officer trying to negotiate medals, position and pay for allowing the bomb plot to go off - worked. For me.Given the movie's success and rave reviews, mine is obviously a minority opinion. Which is fine and congratulations to all of you who enjoyed it. Just as I found it a weird exercise in slightly ugly pointlessness, it is fitting that if it does work for others, it works. That is the nature of any work of the imagination, that both viewpoints are valid.",1,22,39,30 May 2016
Hostel," PrePubescent 18-year-olds
","This is a truly rotten movie with nothing to recommend it. For example, the first half-hour or so has a lot of T&A, all of which is ruined by the three male protagonists running around going Oh Oh Naked Women! like a bunch of 8-year-olds snapping towels in a girls' locker room. When they do get lucky, it's all pretty much So That's Where It Goes! Stupid instead of sexy.Personally, I'd tie 'em up (the guys) to a chair and pull out a scalpel. Which is precisely what happens to them and the rest of the movie turns into a very long, very boring gore-fest. Since these guys have already alienated the audience, the long, drawn-out process of dismembering them has all the satisfaction and drama of a medical school dissection.Speaking of which, the whole movie seems to have been stitched together in the worst possible way from Teenage Male Virgin and Teenage Slasher films.Like most males, once I hit puberty I knew what I had, knew what it was for, and very much looked forward to my first test drive, making that Teenage Nerd Virgin snickering at Naked Ladies seem just plain weird, just pain offensive and just plain retarded. Can you really reach sexual maturity and retain the world-view of a dirty-minded yet clueless 8-year-old for six, eight or even ten years thereafter?",1,1,2,29 April 2013
Tangled," Terrific surprise.
","Agree with all the tens, understand why some people limit themselves to 8 or 9 but IMDb really should toss out (from weighting) most of the negative reviews.Read them all and each one captured somebody riding a hobby horse.Like a person, every movie should be judged on its merits as a movie, not some imagined hidden agenda or some PC baggage about mistreating a rare flower or (Wily Coyote) impossible physics in a cartoon.Saw Tangled on Direct TV (2D) and anxious to see the original 3D version.Great movie.Will buy on DVD.Is this ten lines? What a ridiculous requirement. Hate WebNazis.",10,7,10,21 April 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Couldn't disagree more
","First of all, the visuals are stunning in all three movies. My favorite, the attack of the Ents. All of the battle scenes were great, as well the trek through the caves. Special effects unparalleled.Problem for me: no one to identify with. Elijah Wood's Frodo was a disaster; throughout the trilogy his conflict with the power of the Ring struck me as more of a struggle with constipation. And no else rose above the level of journeyman; all good actors, all performances either flat or histrionic. I just couldn't care about any of them and, in the Fellowship, I actually found trying to watch the meeting forming the fellowship painful.No doubt a lot of my disappointment stems from comparison with the book. Tolkien spends a lot of time establishing the Shire as a Eden, all innocence and ignorance of the big bad world beyond. Frodo's initial journey was one of broadening horizons, a pantomime of the journey from childhood to adulthood, culminating with the recognition of the power of the Ring and the formation of the Fellowship to deal with it. The rest of the trilogy is, basically, an adventure tale. Tolkien, with a lot of precedent to draw from, from the English glorification of the rustic ideal to Treasure Island, succeeded beyond measure. The movies don't.One problem: the English (New Zealand might as well be one of the British Isles, culturally it shares England's core values) don't really understand their own literature. English culture is all about order and repairing that order when it's knocked out of whack. English lit is all about the individual's struggle both with his/her culture and the larger issues of just plain living. This emphasis began with what we call Old English poetry (Beowulf, The Wanderer, the Wayfarer, Deor) and Shakespeare had tons of fun with it in Hamlet and Macbeth and Lear, playing the Individual off the Re-establishment of Order with virtuosity. Dorthy Sayers did the same with Lord Peter Wimsey.Point is, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy suffers from being English; in fact it seems to deliberately down play the characters as individuals. There were times that I couldn't distinguish Aragorn from Boromir or Gandalf from Saruman and, when Gandalf is resurrected from the pit, he seems to be an entirely new character. Tolkien did not suffer from these confusions.Another problem, the nature of the conflict: Tolkien was obviously thinking of Germany and Russia vrs the weak Western democracies as they existed during the 30's but the English have a very different read on the resulting conflict than the other Allies. Again, to the English, the war was about restoring order, with overtones of good vrs evil but not really. And the movies reflect this lack of scope. For all of its grandeur, I just didn't get a sense that the conflict encompassed the apocalyptic conflict between the values of Good and the values of Evil, as it did in Tolkien's original.So, I disagree and, despite the production values, give it four stars.A final point: I couldn't get into the movies because of the acting, emphasis and lack of moral scope; all very personal parameters. If you were able to get into them, for whatever reason, more power to you. I would have loved to do the same.A P.S. - I did identify with the Ents.",Null,0,0,22 April 2012
1941," Obscene
","Thank God Mel Brooks never tried to play the Holocaust for laughs - unfortunately the producers of 1941 didn't know any better, mocking the initial and short-lived fear of a Japanese invasion following Pearl Harbor.This movie was obviously made for the Animal House generation and their strange, slightly warped, sensibility; something like a child's fascination with gross body functions and preference for using feces over oil or watercolor as media.For that generation, the aftermath of Pearl Harbor may well have seemed fair game for their version of what they considered irrelevant humor; after all it'd been 35 years since the real thing and who really remembered the shock and horror of the real 1941? That may have changed in 2001 with the shock and horror of 9-11 and I doubt that those same producers would dare do 9-11 The Movie; hopefully, no set of producers in 2036 will try either.Just as such a movie would be obscene in 2036, 1941 was obscene in 1979 and still is.Apart from the poor choice of subject matter and on its merits as a comedy, there aren't any. By most generations definition of schtick, 1941 was a bomb - as many reviewers pointed out, Three Stooges, not the Marx Brothers and, apart from the Animal House generation, The Stooges get really old around age 6.Bottom line - it just ain't funny.Humor is a very individual characteristic so, if you're an adult and you do still find the Stooges funny, that's your right and I'll defer to your sensibility on the point.But I will not defer to the obscenity of trying to exploit one of the most traumatic events in the history of America for laughs.The wars that followed are fair game - from Catch-22 to Kelly's Heroes or Mr Roberts to the Caine Mutiny but 12-7-1941 and its immediate aftermath isn't, any more than 9-11.Update 9-11-13.'The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming' is a movie I kept trying to remember while writing this review. You may or may not have heard of it but it deals with War Hysteria with intelligence and wit, unlike 1941. Haven't seen it since it's first run but remember it as being gentle and humane, making the point, 'Hey, we're all just people'.",1,19,33,25 August 2013
Brave," Destined for a better reception
","First of all, unless you're talking about a sequel or re-make, comparing films rarely makes sense. I'm sure there are exceptions but Brave isn't one of them.This movie stands on its own quite well - the pluses far out weigh the minuses.The big pluses: Merida and Elinor. The big minuses: Fergus and The Suitors. Fergus himself looks like he's had his head squished between a pan and a rock while all of the suitors share similar physical deformations. Comic relief I guess; Brave doesn't need it.All three of the movie's movements center on Merida and Elinor. The first chronicles Merida's growth into a fiercely independent teenager, a growth supported by both Elinor and Fergus, until it gets to be time for the traditional betrothal of The Princess, which comes as a shock to Merida.She doesn't react well, launching the second movement in which she flees, searches for an alternative and winds up making a very bad choice, which winds up turning Elinor into a bear.Third movement is the ultimately successful quest to reverse the curse.Merida and Elinor are central to all three parts and all three approach, at moments, perfection. From Fergus presenting Merida with her first bow to Merida's rejection of the suitors and the process they represent, Merida's growth into that teenager is about as focused and entertaining as you can get. Same with the other movements: tight focus on the issue at hand, told with skill, intelligence and an eye toward the unexpected and its consequences, as well as Merida's successful conquest of those consequences.As for the ending - well, it is a FairyTale with a FairyTale ending and, while weaker than than the other three parts, does serve well enough as a coda returning to tonic.Brave does occasionally swerve into irrelevant shtick, especially towards the end, but manages to keep on the road and what is a movie without its minor imperfections?",9,2,5,20 April 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Review the movie
","A brilliant example of being damned once you produce a cult classic. I'd suggest removing every review mentioning The Evil Dead so that people don't have to wade through 'this movie isn't the Evil Dead and I really liked the Evil Dead and why didn't Raimi remake the Evil Dead again so I think this movie is a bomb and I really wish he'd remade the Evil Dead' over and over again.I was lucky - caught the movie on USA without knowing, or caring, that it was made by Sam Raimi Who Made the Evil Dead. Instead, I got to see the movie as it is, without reference to Evil Dead, and what I saw was a well crafted, old fashioned, scary and thoroughly entertaining Horror Movie. Cast was great, pacing was great, all of the little 'predictable' bits were great as predictable little Horror Movie bits: when you hear the music, you know something's coming.It did meet a personal prejudice - I don't like Kill Stupid Teenagers/ Slasher movies; was dragged to Texas Chainsaw by a friend on first run long, long ago and was shocked by its emphasis on gore and total lack of a plot. Got over that and was able to appreciate Chainsaw for what it was but still not the kind of movie I'd pay money to see. Same with the first two Evil Dead; loved the third precisely because it had story and plot which is why I really enjoyed Drag Me to Hell: not only did it have story and plot, it had characters you could recognize as human beings, that you could identify with as human being and who were attractive, i.e., who you cared about.So Raimi made an old fashioned Horror Movie and did it extremely well. I can see how those inured by two generations of Slasher Movies would be disappointed that a master of that genre didn't make another one but Get Over It, like I did with Chainsaw. If you don't like old fashioned Horror Movies, that's your right just like it's my right to dislike the Slasher genre, but keep it down to This Wasn't a Slasher Movie. Otherwise, review the Movie on The Screen, not the the movie that wasn't.P.S. Drag Me does have a lot of references to recent (relatively) movies. Main character is straight out of Clueless and Buffy and that oh-so predictable séance scene was full of references to both ancient (30s and 40s) and modern movies, like every vampire movie made in the last 15 years. My only complaint, the compulsory Carrie ending. Even that was well done but I would have preferred Happily ever After and forget Carrie.",10,1,2,29 October 2011
The Happening," Ummm . . .
","Don't know quite how to rate this; wish IMDb had a N/A.First, most of the audience should have been warned that this is a massively manneristic movie so forget any Hollywood conventions. Nothing wrong with either the acting or the direction.Second, the movie is about evoking a sense of unrelieved dread in the audience without providing a comfortable denouement to release the tension it builds up. I saw it on FMC; if I'd been in a movie theater I'd have been out of there half-way through precisely because of that tension. Then I would have looked for it on Netflix (they don't have it).As I watched, two analogs immediately came to mind: John Wyndham's book, The Day of the Triffids (not the movie) and the movie, The Uninvited (1944). The book echoes the movie's sense of increasing isolation in the face of a (initially) inexplicable 'natural' force and the movie (Uninvited) echoed the unrelenting sense of dread and tension (which were relieved). And that's what The Happening is all about, period. It wasn't about the characters (you want bad acting in a manneristic Film, try Kramer vs Kramer or Diary of a Mad Housewife).The characters in The Happening are there to be watched, observed, not identified with. They were meant to be distanced from the the audience. That's what the pacing was about: basically stopping everything every so often just to send the audience back into the theater, and that's why the characters just seem to pause, foreshadowed by the sudden pauses that presaged the attacks. That's why the characters go suddenly flat periodically and that's why there are no panicking hordes or scenes of urban destruction with fires and sirens. The Hollywood goal of drawing the audience into the movie is turned on its head.Bottom line: this is very spooky movie that, however you feel about it, does what it intends to do And has a nice turn on the ubiquitous Carrie ending: a return to tonic instead of a kick in the groin.",8,2,4,13 August 2012
Contact," Well Done
","Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work.Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type.But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot.And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the 'Me Tarzan' thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge.And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues.The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling.This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen.Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere.While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone?That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.",9,2,5,6 May 2013
