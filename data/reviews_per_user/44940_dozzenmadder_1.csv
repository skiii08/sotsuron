Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Take it for what it is
","Utterly fantastic, for what it is. The stories in this series are simple, the acting not very deep, but the settings are literally out of this world. The scope of this movie jumps from planet to planet, and the attention to detail is simply stunning. There is always something happening. I think it would take several viewings before you actually catch every single event that takes place. Overall, a worthy successor to the original series, although it seems primarily aimed at children. I wish they had subtitles when Jar Jar Binks was speaking.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
