The Ring," The horror! The horror!
","And I thought The Exorcist was scary... I'm usually bored, when I see a so called scary movie. These days they're all about a masked avenger stalking young, hot looking girls with a knife. But this one, The Ring, was different. I was so scared during and after this movie, that I expected to have a heart attack. Half the time I couldn't even look straight at the screen, which was a first for me. It has been three days since I went to see The Ring, and I'm still avoiding my VCR. This movie had great actors who I had never seen before, great plot and real live and loud horror. I'm surprised if I ever go see another scary movie in my life! I'm glad, that there is still someone out there who can make a real horror movie. But at the same time I wish I had never seen this one. If you're going to see this I have one advice: DON'T GO ALONE!",10,1,2,10 March 2003
