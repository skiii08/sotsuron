Mission: Impossible III," This time the mission WAS impossible
","I didn't like the third mission; I didn't like it at all. The first two were much, much better.First of all, the script was pedestrian, nothing special there. Kerri Russell was completely wasted in this  she deserves better roles. This is Tom's show  and Tom's show alone. That's fine with me  he IS Ethan Hunt after all  but he was very annoying this time around and his screen presence was definitely lacking. The action scenes were only so-so. And, yes - the love story was very unconvincing. Miss Monaghan looks great (so does Cruise  for his age anyway) but there's no chemistry between them.Don't watch this on the big screen  If you must see it, rent the DVD.",3,7,14,7 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," sucks
","I'm very disappointed! This movie is long and boring. They should have cut it to 100 min. to make it work. The Zion scenes are completely unnecessary and dull. Action set peaces are crafty filmed but, at times, are very monotonous. The story is VERY thin and farfetched and the ending is just awful . And one more thing: Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor! He maybe looks cool, but he just can't act. Plus: Fishburne is to fat for the part, and his character is EXTREMLY annoying this time around. All in all: cheap thrills and no substance, a couple of good action sequences are all you could hope for. 3/10",3,0,0,23 May 2003
