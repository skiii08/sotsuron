Minority Report," Fantastic movie!
","I don't usually see so many good movies, but this one is amusing very good. To have full open eyes all the time. Near future. Who can say opposite, is faking. Tom Cruise is great actor, he have couple/some/so many of good movies and this one proves it.Don't need to much to talk about the concept. It explains it self. It is very long, and productive movie. And fits to the real fictions. Not Li-La boring Aliens, vampires, wolf people, and other super man...My ten points.Sincerely, D",10,1,2,9 December 2006
The Italian Job," It is not good as think it was.
","They done the job. They are already the millionaires and one of them must take all? And no where in the movie you can see what for he take it? O yea, bought a big TV? The funny think they all stay a live - with oxygen bottle idea? About the faces... guy with a mustache - o everybody caring mustache this days... and what is the point, they found him and then make a competition with him? One an hour car scenes around the city for nothing... pretty much boring film.I can't give you more than 2 point -- sorry. I need something real good. Production is maybe good, but the actors and concept totally boring.Best, D.",1,3,9,2 December 2006
City of God," What to say?
","What to say,this movie must be seen two times. It just developing all the time. Scenes never stop. It is not usually LA circle crap. When somebody writes something what he actually have seen it must be good. When somebody all his life sits in his office and start to write a movie scripts. usually goes: Aliens comes...Is incredible thing how the small guys can create the story? I have recently watch movie: ''Moi Caesar'' - a French movie, it is so similar when the young guy is main person there.And start with a chicken it is racial! I like it!my recommendation is: ''dom za vesanje''My ten points.Best,",10,0,2,21 November 2006
The Big Blue," ''This is the One of the best movie I will ever watch''
","''You can see it so many times and always you will feel the same. The same wish and the same beauty of feeling about it.'' This is the One of the best movie I will ever watch, is there any movie around who can be compared with this one? Titanic perhaps... But the Big Blue is the master peace of this earth ever. Two main actors in this movie are the most if I can express ma self: the nicest and the prettiest actors ever!!! Not mamas blond boys...I would like to see something similar to it... but you can found, nothing than a shark stupidity on Atlantic / Pacific oceans. Mediterranean will live for ever as it beautiful and always welcome.",10,6,8,21 January 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I like it.
","Very smart story. There is something to learn form it. I like the idea about the future TV. When the boy have get inside TV tube. Also very good production. I recommend it to everyone. Even the oldest one.The thinks I didn't like: I don't like musical, make me sleepy or nervous when the really action will start... I usually use forward button... who watch the musicals anymore? And as I heard the story is devolved from the original old movie? So probably was easy to write it? Is it audience really like to watch new movies based on the old ones? That is the reason I did not vote here? Do I must vote for a cast, production or a screenplay?",9,0,2,26 December 2006
Total Recall," master peace
","i think by sc-fi genre this is the top movie and never ever will be done something similar too. to found a good interesting sc-fi movie in video store is a ''joke''...if i make this movie to day, what i would change: bullets which can not goes thro the glass cupola. kinda of magnetic catch. but if u come with the weapons from the earth i guess u can break it...i do not believe in aliens, so will not use them anywhere. but writers constantly do? there is couple of silly things in the movie like when the taxi car hit the wall and get explode by pisses robot taxi driver? what for? (cars in the future could be better) ALSO gravity has nothing to to with the oxygen thing? ALSO to make the planet runs by changing the air gas substance it will take centuries..SATURN is a gas planet there is no possibilities to live there watching the movie is really pleasure dom but whole concept is easy and short.I recommend this movie to all travel agencies!!! Best wishes, I am writer too PS about the Recommendations, If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends: NOT GOOD",10,7,16,8 November 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," ''Elita movie''
","High movie, It is even beyond me. To shame. I drive a good car, but I don't have that fun. I don't now anything about this story, I don't read Hollywood Report... but I truly believe plot have come from some rich bad west garage.It is fantastic movie. No doubt. Lovers should watch it. If you are jealousy guy, you will not like it. But you just have to let your emotions flow up... Production and the actors are so fine. This is not cheep production. And it is very long, I like it.Recommendation for DVD-s collection.",10,2,4,25 December 2006
Blade Runner," Master peace.
","This movie is the master peace from the all others. This is the best movie of Harrison Ford (I am not his fun). Comparable with old Arnold Schwarzenegger movies like: Terminator 1, The Running Man, Total Recall, etc... even the Alien 1979.This type of the movies I called magic - creative geniality of the writer. The people who can see or create a near future. And I don't like when the other new writers use idea like: zoom me this picture? It is so shabby.I give 10 points for this one. And would like it to have it in my DVD collections.",10,2,4,19 December 2006
Contact," Intelligent movie!
","where James Woods is, got to be good. He is not looking, but he is unique. I believe he is the only actor in Hoolywood who really reads the screenplay. He really chose the script where he is going to play. Some actors always play the same similar rules... but actually they don't fit there.My big ten points for this movie! This movie needs brain to watch it. The only thing I din like it (I am engineer) is: schematics for construction of that ship. Radio waves, why should aliens use radio wave? Codes, 3-dimensional, etc.. are stories for a kids...(this line i have extra add here: about the religious in this movie. i have notice half of you talks about it. Yes, u can simply say religion has nothing to the with it, and is doll. but it makes this movie more longer, and more participating)Best,D",10,0,4,29 November 2006
