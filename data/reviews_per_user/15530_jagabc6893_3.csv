Whip It," Whip It....Skip It!
","This movie was not as good as I thought it would be. Ellen Page is sweet and she is obviously very talented. However, she is starting to come off as a whiner to me. She was not quite as sarcastic, and she did not try to be as 'cool' as she was in Juno, but she is still a little annoying for some reason. Drew Barrymore's performance was really disappointing to me. I felt she did very little and her role was almost a 'cameo'. She just pops up from time to time, says very little, and tries to act tough. Also, let me ask you this? Does Ellen Page look 21? No, she looks like she is 14. How in the world are her teammates surprised when they find out she is only 17? Also, being a person who has roller skated for over 30 years, I guess I found it hard to believe that Bliss would be the fastest person out there when they were doing time trials. She looked slow and awkward. They guy that Bliss falls for looks like a loser. My wife was like, 'why is she even bothering with that ugly guy?' I didn't get it.I hate to bash this movie, because I was really looking forward to seeing it. However, I am finding it hard to say something good about it. Juliette Lewis actually gave one of the best performances in the movie. She is one of the few who actually pulled off the 'edgy, tough roller-girl' persona. This movie was nothing special, and the box office returns will show it.",5,20,40,12 October 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious, Pleasant Surprise
","I'm ashamed to say it, but I did not have much desire to see this film. I decided to give it a shot after it was playing at the right time to coincide with some free time I had. That was one of the best decisions I've made lately regarding movie watching. It was probably the best movie I have seen this year.In my opinion, Christoph Waltz steals the show as the 'Jew Hunter'. He speaks four different languages, and he displays a sort of sophisticated ruthlessness that few could duplicate. He is calm, cool and collected for most of the film, but you can tell he could explode at any moment (which he unexpectedly does in one surprising scene). The French actress, Melanie Laurent, gives a fine performance as the young owner of a cinema in Paris with the chance to change the course of World War II. I'd like to see more of her in the future. Brad Pitt is a bit over the top in his portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine, but he is still entertaining to watch.What made the movie so special to me was Tarrantino's ability to build tension and an uneasiness in certain scenes. Without spoiling anything, I will speak about this in general terms. In three or four scenes, you are aware that the bad guy and the good guy are both onto each other, but the tension comes from seeing who will break first or make the first move. The consequences will be great, so this just adds to the emotion and the suspense of the moment.In short, if you had any reservations about seeing this film, please put them aside, don't be too critical of historical inaccuracies, and just go and enjoy a very good movie.",9,0,5,13 October 2009
Wanted," Wasted: Money and Time
","I don't usually write any comments about movies I have seen, but this one is so bad I feel I have to warn others who are considering going to see it. Unless you like hearing the 'f-bomb' every other sentence, and like seeing about 100 people get shot in the head, don't waste your time on this one. I'm used to seeing violence, but the amount of carnage in this film is ridiculous. In one scene, the cadaver of an old lady who could be your grandmother is used for target practice and shot in the head. In another scene, the main character of the movie shoots a fellow assassin in the eye, pushes the gun through his head and shoots at others...while running with the dead guy hanging from his gun. Give me a break. This is just a couple of the many examples of how ridiculous and over the top the movie was.As far as the performances go, James McAvoy has been pretty good in some others movies I've seen him in, but this type of movie is not his thing. He is unconvincing as a 'bad-ass' killer, and his attempts at trying to be tough border on annoying. Morgan Freeman is emotionless and gives little to the movie. Angelina Jolie is decent and plays her part pretty well, but that does not help with the rest of the poor cast.This movie might appeal to some, but I did not care for it at all. My wife turned to me about 1/4 of the way through and said, 'I hope this gets better, because it really sucks so far.' It only got worse, and I considered walking out a couple of times. The only positive of the movie is that it had some pretty creative shots and gimmicks here and there. If you want to see it, wait until it is released on DVD.",2,17,50,2 July 2008
