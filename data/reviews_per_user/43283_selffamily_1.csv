Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This old lady found it funny
","My kids warned me repeatedly - 'you wont like it mum', and 'I don't think it's for you.' 'Not your taste' etc. Well I'm happy to say that I ignored them and rented it out anyway. What a delight! Light and funny all the way through and cleverly done - constantly we asked each other, did these people know it was for a movie? The only people I felt sorry for were the owners of the antique store and the bed and breakfast hosts. I could go on for pages, as others have done, but it's lighten up time and smell the coffee - this guy has parts of society tagged and sorted. It wouldn't matter what country he made the movie in, he would find these people. Very good",8,1,2,5 April 2008
