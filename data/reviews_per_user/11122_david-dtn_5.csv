The Avengers," Overrated but worth a watch
","Avengers was completely over rated in my opinion and for many reasons. The four main characters were great Hulk, IronMan, Capt and Thor but the rest were just there to provide filler and the two assassins Hawkeye and Blackwidow had way too much screen time especially Blackwidow played by Scarlett Johansson. She is in almost every scene and is a really poor choice for this role in my opinion. I could think of a handful of actresses who are more deserving for this role than Johansson and put that with the fact she is is the weakest of all the actors in the film and you really begin to grate at the sight of her. As far as the look of her character black widow i would say she is no where near what she should look like. In all of her fight scenes she looks non atlethic and you can clearly tell when the stunt double fills in for her. Her fight scenes were laughable and really brought the rest of the great cgi fight scenes down. The second half of the film drags a bit with a lot of the Chitari henchmen being used as cannon fodder for our heroes and are are dispatched so easily you would wonder why there were sent in the first place as most of them are incompetent or just plain stupid! Its a solid enough film just let down a lot by Johansson and Jeremy Renner who was used as filler since the cgi fight scenes between the Hulk, Capt, Thor and iron man must have cost a pretty penny and they obviously felt it was too much of a risk to over spend in case the film bombed. Its a pity because it could have been a lot better without the unnecessary padding.",7,2,5,5 February 2014
Blood Diamond," A strange mix
","What an odd film. I usually go into watch a film with a bit of background knowledge concerning plot or the general theme. I never saw the trailer for this one so i had no idea what to expect. To basic plot is about a civil war in Sera Leon and the murder and exploitation of its own people for the acquisition of its diamonds. Instead of helping the people in the region to free themselves from the tyranny of the rebels who are hell bent on using there own people as slaves to collect and harvest diamonds, the governments of the west exploit them further by aiding the rebels with money and fire arms. There are a few sub plots concerning the political back drop. The problem is its not really that interesting or entertaining. Thankfully there a few of these scenes and the story focuses more on the three lead charterer's and their own individual stories. Decaprio plays a diamond smuggler at odds with himself and his country, and is good in this but I'm not sure about his South African accent. It seemed forced in certain parts but this is only a minor grip. Jennifer Connellys plays a reporter in the midst of the turmoil. Her character seemed a little clich√©d at the start with her presence only serving as a love interest but as the film progress's we soon learn more about her motivations and her own personal struggle. Djimon Hounsou really stood out in this in his role. I remember him in Gladiator, however he was a bit wooden there but wasn't given much material to work with. He has more to do in this film and steals every scene with a very genuine performance. My only problem with this film was what it was trying to be. It was a mix of different genres and as a result it felt a bit disjointed. I wasn't sure if i was watching an action adventure, action drama, war/romance or some combination of the above. For the most part this strange mix actually worked and combined to make a very watchable film. I don't think i would watch it again but the performances from its lead characters (especially Djimon Hounsou) make it 2 hours well spent.",7,1,1,16 March 2007
Blade Runner," 'The light that burns twice as bright lasts half as long'
","On first viewing of Blade Runner most people will be left confused and probably a little disappointed. Even thought the studio had there way to some extent (cutting part of Scotts original vision in order to increase profits) this was not a film made to appeal to a mass market audience. Anyone looking for a generic action film with an obvious conclusion will be disappointed. For these reasons it did fail commercially on its first release in 1982.It could be best described as a film noir set in the future. Power hungry corporations harness control over a mixed race of neo-Tokyo lower-class citizens living in a decadent Los-Angeles slum. Enter Rick Decard a retired private eye who gets unwillingly hired to hunt down and eliminate a group of replicants who have escaped an off-world colony and arrived on earth to in order to extend their four year limited life span.Based on the Philip K. Dick novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep', there are many existential themes running throughout and many questions purposely left unanswered so the viewer can come to his own conclusion. What is the nature of our existence? What does it mean to be human? Do we fully appreciate life? Are but a few.Everything about this film works. The cinematography is outstanding with every scene meticulously shot. The set and design are also stunning and still sets the standard for which every sci-fi film aspires too.The actors are also cast perfectly. Harrison Ford plays Rick Decard a man troubled by the demons of the past with seemingly no escape from his violent reality. Rutgar Hauer is Roy Batty the replicant leader haunted by his mortality, unable to find a cure. The supporting cast also put in memorable performances. A special mention to the futuristic, synthetic score by Vangelis that draws the viewer deeper into Scotts dystopian view of the future. It gets better with repeat viewings in that you slowly uncover new insights into the character motivations and the heavy use of symbolism. Its a near flawless film and could entertain endless hours of discussion. Watch both the directors cut and voice over editions to fully appreciate this masterpiece.",10,6,11,6 February 2007
Casino Royale," Deserves the accolades
","As Bond films go this would have to rank up there with the best of them, if not the Best. Only Connery's From Russia with Love and Gold-finger entertain on the same level. This is a more cold, calculating hard-edged secret agent similar to the original Novel. Full marks to Daniel Craig for his portrayal of Bond. He should be cast in a lot more lead roles after this to make use of his considerable acting talents. He looks the part too, obviously packing on a bit of muscle for the stunts and the physical roles that are by far the best seen in any Bond film thus far. There are one or two weak moments but this has more to do with the script than the plot which is well thought out and offers up a few twists which keeps your interest right the way through. Its a long film but the action never lets up and there's enough eye candy in here to keep your interest even through the less dramatic moments. The score has been criticized by many but it fits the theme quite well and will stay in the memory long after the film ends. The casino scenes could have so easily been the low point of the film after the action that proceeds but it manages to be engaging through most of the scenes and this is important since its what carries the plot. Don't expect many campy gadgets or cheesy one-liners although they are there but are used sparsely and help to lighten the dark tone that runs right from beginning to end. So to sum up. Bond is back, shaken but not stirred.",9,0,2,14 December 2006
The Matrix," Open your mind to the matrix
","Im not going to elaborate too much on the plot of the Matrix because there are whole websites and even books devoted to the subject. The story revolves around the main character Neo and his evolution from lonely computer hacker to the savior of the human race. Part of this evolution is the realization that not all is as it seems in the reality in which he lives in. If your any way philosophical or just like a good sci-fi you cannot go wrong with the matrix. There's a strong religious sub text apparent within the story and a lot of Neo's actions and decisions seem to mirror that of Christ. It can also be looked at as an allegory of modern day society and the control governments have over their citizens. Whatever way you look at the matrix it will make you think below the surface of the pretty visuals and the dynamic actions scenes. These range from martial arts face offs against 'agents' to post apocalyptic worlds inhabited and controlled by strange machine like creatures. The Matrix has a visual style like no other and it deserves its spot in the top 250 films just for the story alone.Keenu Reeves was born for this role and delivers a very subtle but effective portrayal of of Neo while Hugo weaving seems like he was having fun playing the bad guy Agent Smith, Neo's nemesis. The score is high tempo filled with modern dance and electro tracks. They fit perfectly and come alive during the adrenaline filled fight scenes. This is one film you really shouldn't miss. I've seen it at least ten times and each time i discover something that i missed the first time. Its a deep film with its own universe and philosophy that many people (fans of sci-fi or not) will be fascinated by.",10,0,1,21 March 2007
