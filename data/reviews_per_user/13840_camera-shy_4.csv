Black Swan," Its beyond me...
","Im a regular guy, no psychotic tendencies or mental health issues, whoever wrote this however is a seriously twisted individual that should really seek help.The film its self is so highly strung that virtually every scene makes you feel uneasy. Its not like a horror movie or a thriller ,they may be frightening but they have normal structure that keeps you grounded in the real world , well not this film. If i had to class it id have to say its a psychological snuff film, you feel like you're looking into the mind of an insane person (the writer). Its not my cup of tea, i gave it 4 for good acting.It does beg the question if that is what the life of a ballet dancer is like with the whispering, name calling and the paranoia with everyone trying to stab you in the back why would anyone want to be a part of it?. And if its not what the hell is the writer trying to say? is the ballet part of it irrelevant and the story could as easily been about a waitress or business woman. Why not just skip it all and go film some real loonies at an asylum and save the millions of dollars.",4,1,3,14 March 2011
Meet Joe Black," truly amazing
","I think this is one of those occasions that film has created something bigger than its self, film is just celluloid and a great number of talented people doing their job however in this instance due to what can only be described as beautiful acting and an incite by the director and writers into the true depth of what makes us human, they have made something truly meaningful.As an independent filmmaker myself i can only wish to work on a project with a cast as talented as these, Its incredible how the eyes of a great actor can convey more than any dialog ever could and for that reason It is and will always be one of my favorite films.",10,2,3,10 July 2008
Centurion," A bit confused
","Im a big Neil marshall fan, he seems to be one of the few Brits who can still entertain you. I know he's a man of the people and likes going to festivals doing Q$As so i'm hoping he reads these reviews........please don't ever do a British gangster movie, you, Ridley Scott, Danny Boyle etc are our only hope for a decent film industry over here.Having said that with this film although i loved it like i knew i would being a Scotsman i was a bit confused as to whom i should be cheering on!. Its always been a great bit of Scottish pride knowing we were the only country they couldn't invade and for that reason i was all for the Picts. On the other hand the characters were engaging and you couldn't help wishing them to safety.....its kind of like watching the battle of the bulge from the Germans point of view.Anyway its a good solid movie well worth watching.",8,14,31,12 August 2010
Braveheart," Its just a movie but its a great one
","I've been reading the reviews on here and i noticed there are very few if any from Scottish people, well i thought id do the honors. I was born in Lanark, the town at the start where his wife was killed ,(which looks nothing like Lanark by the way, the terrain i mean obviously our houses have seen improvement over the years..... there are no huge hills in the background), i still live there to this day. So you can imagine Wallace has always been a prominent figure here.As far as the bad reviews about historical inaccuracies are concerned I had to laugh..... how accurate do you expect it to be from a time when most people couldn't write? you can squabble over the little details if it makes you feel better.....I'm sure Wallace was a ruthless man in real life who most likely did horrible things but it was a ruthless time. No one can say with any real accuracy what actually happened....it was 700 years ago and if you think you can then your as bad as the people you are attacking......most people have trouble remembering what they did 15 years ago in their own lives so give it a break.Bottom line, there are some historical facts in this movie you can take to the bank ,his wife was killed, he rose up and gathered an army of angry Scotsmen and took the country back.....I know this because I don't have an English accent. You guys that pis# and moan about daft little things would make horrible filmmakers, I'm sure your movies would be boring as hell.Its just a movie and if you can watch this and not feel something then you're dead inside. It will always be a favorite of mine despite them screwing up what my hometown looks like!",10,4,10,5 December 2010
