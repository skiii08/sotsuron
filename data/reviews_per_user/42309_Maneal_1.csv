Requiem for a Dream," More than say no to drugs
","After reading various comments on the film, I read a comment stating that the films only apparent message is 'say no to drugs.' I have to ask this question: why on earth did these characters begin using in the first place? Look at Sara for instance: her life revolved around the TV. Upon hearing she is going to actually be on TV, she becomes obsessed with looking perfect, fitting into the ideal dress. She can't restrain herself, because us spoiled americans rarely have to live on limited means, and ends up on miracle pills to help her lose the weight, rather than use self control. This film is a commentary on material culture as a whole. Why does Harry sell drugs? To make money to buy 'stuff.' Well, yes, sometimes that stuff is more drugs, but he buys his mother a large screen TV, as if that would make her happy. These characters have no understanding of how to achieve happiness. And how can they in this world that tells us that purchased goods equal happiness? So to limit the film to anti-drug propaganda or what not is utterly ridiculous. This is a brilliant film criticizing not drugs, but culture. As Tyrone's mother tells him, I don't want you to make it rich (in so many words), I just want you to love your mother. I may be exaggerating my point, but please see this film for something more than surface value.",10,0,0,11 November 2000
