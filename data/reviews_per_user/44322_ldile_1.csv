Iron Man 3," My word its bad.
","There will be spoilers here. This movie fails because there too many jokes and doesn't get really serious. Stark as a character will always be emotionally distant but it would have been nice to see him fell more, but all we get are a few panic attacks and flashbacks that are suddenly cured just before the climax of the movie. What was done to mandarin was weak at best. it feels the big reveal that the mandarin is an actor was well not thought of,a seriously weak twist, basically turning iron-man's biggest villain into a joke. I'm not saying the mandarin is iron-man's joker but he is a massive villain in the comics. AIM was messed up as well and how come his suit gets destroyed so easily after the avengers movie where he took Thor's hammer to the chest and defeated alien hordes with each of his getting beat up but still in working condition. I get that Shane black wanted show the brilliance of the man out of the suit but we know about his brilliance from first movie, i mean he built a frickin suit in cave. As an action flick, its great. so go watch it but I'm a fan of comics so i cant abide by this piece of crap. It killed continuity for a villain an a terrorist think tank.",3,6,12,4 July 2013
