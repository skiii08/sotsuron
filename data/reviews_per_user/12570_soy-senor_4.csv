Divergent," Something Different
","The divergent series is a extremely different concept used by Neil Burger, its unlike the other action, romantic and thriller movies we usually get. The series highlights the future that may come wherein each human would be divided according to the faction ie their human characteristic. The problem is the person who has some characteristic of all faction needs to killed since they are considered as a threat to human society who do not fit in any category. The story revolves around how Shailene Woodley the lead who is a divergent gets into one of the faction and later is recognized as a divergent. Amazing role of Kate Winslet who is casted in a negative role who requires all the power in her hand and control of all the faction. Overall an amazing movie with some different concept.",9,1,3,6 December 2015
