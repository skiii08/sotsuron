The Rock," An action packed, high octane thriller with great performances. ***1/2 out of ****.
","THE ROCK / (1996) ***1/2Starring: Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, Jon Spencer, David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, and Vanessa Marcil. Directed by Michael Bay. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated R (for strong intense violence, language and brief sexuality)Notes taken while screening The Rock:· The film contains superior character development of both the antagonist and protagonist. Each is clear and well defined. We also learn the characters motives, reasoning, dramatic situation, and premise--all brilliantly introduced within the setup.· Sean Connery provides us with strong character development through John Patrick Mason--although the character is somewhat a rip off of the Anthony Hokins' Hannibal from 'The Silence of the Lambs.'· It is uncanny how well the movie's visual style works. It propels the film's suspense the extra mile, increasing the tension and enticement. Also contributing to the style is the fitting soundtrack.· Some of the events are excessively coincidental. For example, during an exciting chase scene, Mason dashes out of a building, escaping the clutches of concealing police, discovering a Hum-V seemingly awaiting his arrival. Experienced chemist, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), chases after him, in a high speed Ferrari  sitting outside his position in a building. Another coincidence occurs in the high security prison, where Mason escapes a grenade blast by dashing at random into a room, where, of course, there just so happens to be a secure bathtub to climb in. · There is a stolid, aggressively effective cast present. Each actor contributes a taut, penetrating performance, especially Ed Harris as the film's villain, General Francis X. Hummel who demands a moral purpose holding the lives of an urban area at stake.* The character's motives and perfectly defined, especially General Francis X. Hummel.  Even as the film's bad guy, he serves an understandable position, thus we empathize with him, unlike most villains witnessed in modern day thrillers.· The standard three act structure is flawless: each scene propels the plot forward. The sequences either create a new problem or complicate a previous conflict, favoring with the later concept. This raises the line of tension even further.· Most of the production takes place in a high security prison, Alcatraz, crafted with a complex, awe-inspiring atmosphere towering over that of most action movies.· Sean Connery handles the complicated role of John Mason with mere simplicity, yet easily torments the audience with a sense of omniscient knowledge of the plot.· The picture is unpredictable and contains several inducing and unexpected twists proving this movie is imaginative and free to surprise us. The conclusion is not fomulatic. 'The Rock' is filled with artful design and crafty performances. It is one of the year's best action films.Brought to you by  Hollywood Pictures.",8,72,104,20 March 2000
The Devil's Advocate," Smart in its use of the devil as its villain--and great performances. *** out of ****
","THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (1997) ***Starring: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron, Craig T. Nelson, Connie Nielsen, and Jeffrey Jones Director: Taylor Hackford  144 minutes  1997  Rated RBy Blake French: 	'The Devil's Advocate' is like an HBO Friday night guilty pleasure movie. It gets so many things right on the money, from suspense to gore to how the devil really does work. Most of the time movies exaggerate monsters and myths, legends and killings. But Taylor Hackford gets his information correct: Satan is not a red colored monster with horns and a spiky tail, but a deceptive, conniving, individual in disguise and lives everywhere. Thus, 'The Devil's Advocate' is so smart it's scary. 	The story is something to see. It is so wonderful and evenly laid out. It stars Keanu Reeves as Kevin Lomax, a young successful defense lawyer who, with his wife Mary Ann (a flawless and emotionally charged Charlize Theron), has recently moved to New York in order to hit it big with his occupation.
And that is exactly what happens. He soon stumbles upon a powerful man named John Milton in charge of the cities biggest and best defense attorneys. He offers Kevin a deal, a beautiful office, a competitive wage, and bang, he his in goodbut he doesn't know yet how good he actually is in yet.Then things begin to happen. Bad things. Horrible things. Mostly to Mary Ann, Kevin's wife who has meet a friend, Christabella, who isn't quite who she seems to be. Then come the experiences: She hears someone in the house while alone at night that turns out to be a small child who isn't quite as innocent as she seems. Then the visions of people being brutally killed appear in her mind. Then the loneliness, such a big, cold apartment with no husband to share it with, for he is always at work.  Such things may or may not lead to other events that trigger an involving series of happenings which make this subplot almost more interesting that the real story itself.
Then come the criminals who the wondering Kevin witness as they walk away from a case that surly points to their guilt. And then the temptations that he is lured with every day at work. It is when his wife doesn't something drastic when he questions just exactly is his new boss, and where exactly did he come from.The film is very interesting from beginning to end, and is certainly different than your typical horror/slasher movie. This one doesn't overdue the gore, but puts in more than enough to turn a head. The violence is harsh and cruel, only proving what powers this character in control has. The sexual orientation is a bit over the top, and yes, this film is adult with every atom of it's being, but to put in such copious amount of nudity and sexual content is still a little much. But once again, is only present to make clear that the devil works with enticement and lust, rather than sucking his victims in with force.  Al Pacino is delicious and devilishly on target as Satan himself; I personally could not think of someone better to cast. He is, however, a little aggressive. The film works because of the way it uses the devil as its protagonist.  But Pacino seems to push the evil and demonic qualities, like his voice at times, and kind of destroys the concept of why this movie succeeds. Don't get me wrong, his performance is near perfect, but a little off the film's accomplishment.  Keanu Reeves is well casted also. He performs confidentially like a real lawyer would, and seems to be knowledgeable in his territory. I also found Charlize Theron's performance to be superb. And going from this to 'Might Joe Young' is an awful big change in pace. But this performance not only proves that she can conquer characters in horror thrillers better than family adventures, but also that she can perform with depth and depression, with feeling and emotional impact. I find her Oscar capable.
There is one major problem in 'The Devil's Advocate' that struck me as a shock. The film runs well over two hours and gets pretty tedious at times. But the flaw comes with the film's finale: the movie builds up so much for a powerful confrontation between Lomax and Hilton a.k.a. Satan at the end, that it somehow actually finishes in an ending that lasts but ten minutes, and only succeeds to prove it's overall message: you can't mess with a man's free will. There Is character tension, but it is used with dialogue instead of physical contact, and only the last fragment accomplishes anything that it should. This closing is mostly a disappointment. But that's permissible because I am not recommending 'The Devil's Advocate' for the closing scenes, but for the acting, the cleverness of the story, and the use of Satan as its villain, in an altogether adequate movie on Taylor Hackford's credits.",7,5,14,26 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," One of the most scary and realistic films of 1999. ***1/2 out of ****
","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) ***1/2 Starring: Heather Donehue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard Directors: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez   80 minutes   Rated R (for strong language)By Blake French: MICHAEL, JOSH, DO YOU HEAR THAT? ITS PROBABLY A DEAR OR SOMETHING. NO, ITS NOT. THE SOUNDS ARE COMMING FROM ALL AROUND US. WHAT IS THAT. OH MY GOD! ITS GETTING LOUDER! OH MY GOD! ITS COMMING CLOSER! OH MY GOD! WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT! OH MY GOD, ITS EVERYWHERE!That is just a sample of how the new film by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, 'The Blair Witch Project,' is able to scare the living daylights out of an audience without ever having to include scary music, graphic violence, or a gooey, slimy, bloodthirsty creature. The film is created with no special effects either and much of it takes place during the night, and being shot from a camcorder, there is only a black screen in front of us. We witness no one's death--although there are several murderous events that are implied heavily. 'The Blair Witch Project' is one of the years best films.
The movie is more of a documentary than a regular horror thriller. It is based on a 1994 event in Maryland, where three film students, Heather, Josh, and Michael, all follow the idea of Heather to go out into the woods by themselves during the weekend and shot film on the legendary Blair Witch who is supposed to haunt an area nearby. They begin with interviewing people who have seen and or heard about the witch. Then they take one of their cars and drive into the supposedly haunted woods. All of this is being shot on one of two home video cameras held by either Heather or Mike, therefore we see all of the story through the eyes of the characters. What a novelty!Their first day of shooting however, they begin to finds some very weird things. Like a pile of rocks staked in accordance to one of the interviewed witnesses' descriptions. Then what looks like big voodoo symbols carved in the sand and made out of sticks and twigs that appear everywhere. What could be doing this? One of the students believes someone is playing a joke on them. But Heather knows that nobody has any knowledge of their presence there. Therefore, it must be something else...Then mysterious things begin to occur. First the crew discovers they seem to be lost in the woods and have somehow gone off the rout--but Heather insists otherwise. Then they notice the map carried by Heather has disappeared. Soon afterward they start to turn on one another going from being best friends to constantly fighting and bickering at each other. After that, they detected that they have been traveling in circles all day long--and have not covered an inch of ground. That night the crew hears strange noises coming from all around them--ones that sound like young children screaming in pain--but no body is out there with them? When Josh disappears the night afterward, and severed fingers are found the next day, things really begin to heat up. 'The Blair Witch Project' is enlightening and intelligent from the very first scene, allowing us to participate in the characters discoveries, arguments and horrors. The opening is wonderfully crafted by detailing the interviews of the witnesses that not only arise our superstition, but also train our fantasy for what is prom to soon happen. The witnesses cleverly describe that the say 'something' in the woods, not outright telling us it was a witch,  giving us a gold mine for our imagination to feast upon. And by showing us next to nothing throughout the film, this lets us become seriously involved with the characters.  The movie's structure is perfection in itself--and original. The gradual increase in tension--how the crew stars out finding clues, then more and more things begin to happen like the sounds at night, the disappearance of Josh--is what makes this film so frightening. It also develops the character's feelings and emotions using this form of composition. My only complaint is that I think this movie lacks some true suspense, unlike the very well off completion 'The Sixth Sense.' 'The Blair Witch Project' only went for all out terror without ever really getting into a build up. But given the structure use, it is perfectly understandable that this minor flaw is present. 'The Blair Witch Project' is not a data movie in the least. When I attended this film's screening a sat in the back of a young twosome presumable on a date that were squirming in their seats during this movie. The girl was almost asleep and the boy was trying his hardest to please her; going out of the theater to get refills on  popcorn, soda etc. I was thinking to myself that they were closed minded here, and were looking for some graphic action movie. As the movie ended in one of the most tense cliffhanger manors that I have ever seen, only to have them mutter 'finally, its over,' I made a note to warn you in advance: if you are looking for an action packed, muscle mannered, explosive special effects extravaganza, 'The Blair Witch Project' is not for you. If you are looking for a very different view at a scary subject dealing out its terror as psychological tension, and are willing to give the screen your imagination and involvement for 80 minutes, then go see this one. It may make you think twice about going out into the woods again.",Null,1,2,17 August 1999
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great direction, passionate style, beautiful photography, but a week story. *** (out of four)
","THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE / (2000) *** (out of four)By Blake French: 	 	Robert Redford almost always brings a gentle style of passion and hope to his movies, and 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is a great example of how he does it. This film's tone, mood, and atmosphere are dreamlike in appearance and the flavor of the film is assuring and inspiring. Many directors would be tempted to fall into the predictable formula of a typical sports movie, but not Redford. He constructs a delicate, refreshing story not just about winning a golf tournament, but about being happy with what you do best. It has subplots involving love, age, death, anger, war, forgiveness, innocence, and eternity, but mostly compares the game of golf with life itself.
	'The Legend of Bagger Vance' starts with a brilliant, masterful setup only to slowly run into conflicts in the second act. The story revolves around a somewhat complex character named Rannulph Junuh, played wonderfully by Matt Damon. During the 1910's this individual held the record of greatest amateur golfer in the Southeast, and also the luckiest man when he won the affection of Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), the luxurious daughter of the wealthiest man in Savanna Georgia. Now, however, after suffering the horrors of World War II, Junuh is disillusioned, depressed, and only cares about getting drunk and playing poker with his buddies.	Meanwhile, the great depression strikes, Adale's distressed father commits suicide, and she is left with a failed newly opened oceanfront golf resort and a pile of debts. Pressured to sell the property to pay off her many bills, Adale refuses and comes up with an idea to attract attention to the golf course. She nearly puts everything she owns up for a ten thousand dollar exhibition match with two of the world's best golfers. They are Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), a chubby ladies man, and Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch), a suave, sophisticated family man. However, the Savanna locals will not allow the tournament unless there are three players participating. Ten-year old Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief) invites Junuh into the match. While refusal is his first reaction, after meeting a poor black man named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) who offers to be his caddie, Junuh decides to represent Savanna in the tournament.	The plotis sweeping and beautiful up until the second act, where the script becomes desperate and redundant. Junuh begins the tournament on a losing streak, an easy and lazy way of raising the tension level in this kind of movie. Good old Bagger Vance pulls Junuh out of the water, however, and gets his game back to par. Then the movie makes its biggest mistake. It again attempts to increase the amount of tension in the audience by once again making Junuh fall behind. The first time the story exhibits this material we buy into it, but the second we are tired of such contrivances. The movie tries to make up for its mistake by portraying the idea that how the game is won is more important than who wins, but that does not make up for such a major screenplay miscalculation. 	The rest of the movie is stirring and avoids the usual clichés. The filmmakers could have sketched Junuh's competing gofers as hard-edged, one-dimensional plot devices to build tension in the story. Junuh's relationship with Adele is not mushy and erotic but realistic and passionate. Robert Redford put considerable effort into taking each plot point only so far. The only variable limitless here is the grand photography by Michael Ballhaus. He makes the golf course look like an endless pathway to heaven, and recreates the experience all golfers feel as they walk up to the first and last hole during a perfect summer afternoon.
	'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is not a great movie because of its often week plot, but the movie is so magnificently directed, photographed, and acted that it is able to go beyond the boundaries of an undeserving script and still manage to succeed. I recommend the film, but think with a better story, 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' could have been one of the year's most poignant and tactful films.",7,5,17,14 February 2001
Antz," Visually Satisfying but lacks interest. **1/2 out of ****
","I want to start my review of  'Antz' by asking an easy question: What does Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Jennifer Lopez & Danny Glover have in common. No, not that they all live in Hollywood. Each and every one of them contributes their wonderful voice in this movie, which I may say, is the first animated movie from DreamWorks Studio, and benefits from the help of filmmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg, who earlier oversaw the renaissance in Disney animation, and Steven Spielberg.
I also wish to explain to you that even the biggest names in the movie business, which is what this movie contains, and the other pluses of the production do absolutely nothing for the film and minds well have been absent from it. Sure, my star rating was certainly boasted because of them, but in the end, the main and final flaw in this movie is the fact that the movie offers noting of interest to an audience. An ant's  life is the story presented here and quite frankly, I couldn't care less about an ant's life, really.The ant who is magnified in 'Antz' is voiced appropriately by Woody Allen, as a nautical insect who is named Z. He lives in the ground in a deep, dark colony as everyone else does, and has an important job in his colony; to work and obey orders given to him. And after many years of doing so, Z is starting to wonder why he has to, and why no one else wonders this, or what purpose does his mining server.There is another main ant in this movie, Bala, voiced beautifully by Sharon Stone, whose job is to be the future monarch and lay millions of eggs 24 hours a day. She is not too fond of that idea, especially because there is no fun involved with her life. She sneaks out of confinement one day and managers to present herself to the nerdy looking Z and dance with him during a daily festival. But when Bala is caught, Z asks when they will be able to meet once again and she states 'Never.'Z soon catches on that Bala is the princes and so onÂ… that there's about an upcoming soldier march to be presented in front of the royal family. So he asks his massively muscular ant friend, Barbatus (Stallone) who is a soldier to trade places with him for  that event. He says yes and lots of plot twist happen after the tuning point. I could bore (or excite) you with the pathetic story point for the next several paragraphs but I am not that mean, so I will stop there and let the imagination carry through.
I loved the images of the movie. It is fully computer animated and tries to measure up to the magnificent 'Toy Story' and 'Small Soldiers' but doesn't come close to the visual pleasure. You see, those movies: 1) Offered something more than watching an urban insect's adventures, 2) had lots of brilliant colors. 'Antz' gives us two colors; light brown for the ants' bodies, dark brown for the colonies' walls. There are some instances that prove me wrong but for the most part, the only visual enjoyment in this film comes half way thought.I can't recommend 'Antz' for the reason of it didn't do much for me. I give the film a marginal thumbs down because I am one-hundred percent sure that a large majority of an audience will enjoy this picture to the extreme. A one line summary of the movie in my point of view: 'Toy Story' meets 'Starship Troopers' from an ant's point of view.",6,0,0,12 October 1998
Requiem for a Dream," One of the most edgy, defiant, honest movies to be released in years. ****(out of four)
","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM / (2000) **** (out of four)By Blake French:	Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' unravels like a fairy tale nightmare of sunken dreams and hopeless obsessions. In one light it is about bad role models who provide good examples for teens by showing how a life can be changed with drug addiction; in the another, it is about the desperate need of human affection, the sorrow of loneliness, and anxieties of depression. This is the most edgy, truthful, and powerful films released this year; Darren Aronofsky has proved himself to be a superior director.
	In the most simplistic of story descriptions, the movie shows how the lives of four characters spiral downward after they become involved in the consumption of illegal drugs. It's summertime in Coney Island. There is a sweet, lonely widow named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), who lives by herself, addicted to a TV game show hosted by the energetic Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). When she receives a phony telephone call stating she is selected to be the next contestant on her favorite show, Sara decides dieting may be in order to look her best on the air. After struggling with the sight of her refrigerator and the nonstop imagery of junk food, Sara visits her local doctor, who prescribes her diet pills that work miraculously-but turn out to be amphetamines. 	Sara's drug-addicted son, Harry (Jared Leto), and his similar best friend, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans), spend the majority of their time either consuming illegal drugs, or selling them to continue their habit. When their supply is cut off, Marion Silver, (Jennifer Connelly) Harry's girlfriend, soon becomes mixed in the jumble of a loosing streak for the two small time drug-dealers. From murder to withdrawal, to sexual identity and desperation, the characters try severely to regain control of their lives.
	The most absorbing factor in this film is how Darren Aronofsky so vividly captures the mental status of his characters on camera. When they use drugs, there is a short period where their lives seem fulfilled and resourceful. The graphic, often disturbing style Aronofsky uses to show the affects of drugs on his characters is hypnotic: extreme close-ups and brief, intercut images of the character thinking about the drug, then the digestion, injected, swallowed, or snorted. We then quickly see the characters' reaction of the drugs, all done in fast-motion with exaggerated sound effects to portray how quickly drugs take affect, and how quickly they wear off. He also uses a technique of a single frame containing two separate shots of characters within, a great way to show how two people alone together. 	Aronofsky meshes the four characters interlocking lives together with complexity and dexterity; he uses the three friends as one story, and Sara's increasing addiction to her diet pills as another. At the end he cuts among the four major characters showing us where each is heading, all to an unpleasant destination. We really care about the characters, mainly because they are so well defined and introduced. The film provides good material for them to chew on, and we taste the vivid flavor throughout. What truthfully makes Sara so empathetic is how she is compared to the other three drug addicts, and unlike them, she did not choose to travel the road she ends up on. The story gives her several fantasy sequences where she appears as a contestant on her TV show, showing the hope she still beholds and how she believes herself to still be a good-looking lady. 	A great technical crew also supports 'Requiem for a Dream.' The soundtrack, mostly by Clint Mansell, consists of throbbing base and pounding rhythms, is masterful and enthralling; it wonderfully contributes to the on screen occurrences. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is gritty and the art direction by Judy Rhee is uncommonly convincing. The film was originally given the controversial NC-17 rating by the MPAA. Artisan Entertainment portrayed guts when they choose to release it 'unrated' instead of editing the graphic material relating to drugs and sex. Artisan Entertainment is asking theaters to enforce an adults-only policy, which seems kind of contradictory: why have a movie 'unrated' when no children under 17 can be admitted, when the original NC-17 rating has the same jurisdictions? But this is actually a good movie for young people to see if they are considering experimenting with drugs. Through deeply moving characters, and emotionally disturbing events, 'Requiem For A Dream' is the most defiant motion picture to come down the road in ages, and will make an impact on many lives.",10,1,2,5 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Even 'Star Wars' can fall flat on its face if not taken the proper precautions. ** out of ****
","'Star Wars--Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' is a perfect example of how even a movie with as much anticipation and reputation as 'Star Wars' can fall flat on its face if not taken the proper precautions. As I watched the movie fail and flop I though to myself in amazement of how easily the present flaws could have been prevented.  George Lucas must have been perfectly content of his prominence here, and must have thought that hard core fans of his work would except anything, no matter how good or bad, that he would lie in front of their starving faces.The film is said to lead up to the original 'Star Wars' trilogy which was supposed to be the middle addition in the series of three trilogies. I hear that there will be many follow ups to 'Episode 1,' and that what we see in it will only be the baseline for the rest of the upcoming movies. What the filmmakers are undoubtfully forgetting it that until we see the entire threesome, we really can't judge the trio as a whole. But until we see those movies, we simply have to evaluate 'Episode 1,' as a film all on it's own. And as an individual production, it's an inconclusive disappointment.The story really is two plots in one; the first about a futuristic Queen in turmoil and the second about a young boy who just may be 'the chosen one,' by the force. So, what's the force? Being the first in line of a series, it should be the most informative. But these filmmakers assume that audience will already have background knowledge, thus leaving many major plot points absent.Anyway, the movie opens with a confrontation between two Jedi Knights: Qui-Gon Jinn and  Obi-Wan Kenobi, against bad alien frogs. We meet several new characters, most of them fully computer animated, thus an incomprehensible character audience relationship of what little depth the offer.  Queen Amidala is torn from her nation for protection because the 'bad guys,' want her to sign the treaty so that they may do something illegal legal.or something like that.The visual effects in 'Star Wars-Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' are just as you'd expect: some of the greatest in film history, right up there with the ones in  'What Dreams May Come' and 'Event Horizon.' They allow us to experience a sense of discovery in every scene. We are entering a period of technological breakthrough here, and we are almost to the point where directors can project whatever he or she imagines on the screen. George Lucas takes advantage fully with 'Episode 1.' There is one particular overwhelming sequence where Anakin races his flying pod in a championship race. This scene was so fast paced and articulate that I felt dizzy by the end of it.The problem with the movie isn't visual effects or storyline, its characters. Stone faced, woodenly acted, poorly presented, dryly written characters. Never are any of them developed, interesting or understandable. The dialogue is blunt, flat and straight forward, never including any imagination whatsoever. Not once did any individual in the film show emotion, facial of physical reaction to any sort of excitement, thus the audience is almost ignored.I would like to end my review of 'Star Wars-Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' by simply asking that you, who probably will eventually see the film, judge the characters not on reputation of the actors or the movie, but on hard merit. I eagerly await the arrival of the next 'Star Wars' film, although it may sound like I am an anti-star wars guy by this review. In reality I am surely not, enjoying two out of the three originals. I will doubtlessly receive e-mail, which is welcomed, from many fans who disagree with me on 'The Phantom Menace' achievement. I stand firm on disappointment, however. But I continue to have high expectations on the coming attractions. For whenever I saw the young undetailed Anakin Skywalker on screen I thought to myself 'There's the real story.'",4,2,4,4 June 1999
Meet the Parents," One of the funniest comedies of the year, De Niro and Stiller make the perfect comedy pair. *** (out of four)
","MEET THE PARENTS / (2000) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	The main character in 'Meet The Parents' is a Chicago-based male nurse, Greg Focker (pronounced just how it is spelled) who realizes how unlucky a person can be. He is about to propose to his schoolteacher girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), when her sister Debbie (Nicole Dehuff) calls and explains that her new fiancé, Dr. Bob Banks (Tom McCarthy), received a blessing from her father before he asked the question. This information makes Greg reconsider his method of choice, and instead jumps at the opportunity to meet Pam's overprotective parents when they fly to the east coast two weeks later to arrange Debbie's wedding. 	At the airport, the attendants loose Greg's parcels. Thus he arrives without any luggage. Once at Pam's parent's house, they exchange greetings and aquatint themselves with each other. Pam's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) learn about Greg's unusual last name, that he does not like cats, and is a male nurse, all facts that do not settle well with Pam's father. Greg does manage to gift Jack with a pleasant supply of rare flowers. However, even though Pam explained to Greg  that her dad is in the hobby of rare flowers, he does not seem too impressed.
	Even More complications ensue, especially when Greg learns of Jack's peculiar behaviors and suspicious gadgets, such as a polygraph and hidden cameras placed in every room of the house, as well as meeting Pam's brother, Denny (Jon Abrahams), and Debbie's soon to be in laws, Larry (James Rebhorn), and Linda Banks (Phillis George), and Pam's wealthy ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson). Soon, Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase. 	The film introduces Greg and Pam with silly quirks that come up later in the story. Pam's parents are also quite the treat; the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is De Niro and Stiller who make the movie, however. They form an very effective comedic chemistry, even more amusing than the likable shtick between De Niro and Billy Crystal in 'Analyze This.' The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack, and place them in one hilarious situation after another. 	While outrageous and at times explosively funny, director Jay Roach takes the plot seriously. His previous films, including the Austin Powers films and 'Mystery, Alaska,' have had trouble with taking anything seriously. But 'Meet The Parents' has emotional connections, develops solid empathy for Greg, and we really believe he has something precious that can be lost: Pam.
	The movie does not completely develop romantic chemistry between Ben Stiller and Teri Polo, thus there were times when I simply did not believe the two were really in love. The relationship sometimes feels trite and contrived. There are also important plot nuggets left only partially examined: Jack's pot-head son, who could have contributed a lot more to the drug related material, is left as a plot device to provide another string of conflicts within Jack and Greg. 	I really enjoyed the whimsical performances and opportune casting. Ben Stiller reprises his 'There's Something About Mary' role, with cute charm and the obscured zany flippancy. Robert De Niro is perfect in a role he was born to play, with serious attitude that results in the main portion of the film's funny moments. Blythe Danner is also charming in a kind of role that is becoming all too usual for her.	'Meet the Parents' is one of the funniest movies of the year. It gives audiences with a solid story that does not interfere with the comic material, but contributes to it. The top notch performances and lively direction also raise the film to a higher level. During a year in which effective comedies are an endangered species, 'Meet The Parents' is a landmark achievement in light entertainment.",7,67,97,1 November 2000
The Big Lebowski," One of the most original, unique movies of recent years. *** (out of four)
","THE BIG LEBOWSKI / (1998) *** (out of four)By Blake French:The Coen Brothers are an artistic breed of their own. They add a twisted touch of humor to every project. They create imaginative characters, memorable stories, and ingenious dialogue. They have explored the lives of poets, hillbillies, cops, mobsters, adulterers, killers, and now a loser.
That's right, 'The Big Lebowski' explores the life of a big-time loser. A lazy, uninspiring, unemployed loser. His name is Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who lives in the moment and wears a goatee, a beer belly, a ponytail, and a pair of oversized Bermuda shorts. He lives to bowl, drink White Russians, and to do drugs. (Character: What do you do for recreation? The Dude: Oh, the usual. Bowl, drive around. The occasional acid flashback).
The Dude's best bowling pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi), who is never allowed to finish a sentence, and Walter (John Goodman), who is stuck in the past, diddle with the Dude as he goes with the flow, inhibiting not a care in the world. Until a porn king confuses the Dude for another person with the same name of Lebowski. Thugs invade the Dude's house, plunge his head into the toilet, and pee on his rug. They leave after they realize they have mistaken his identity. However, the Dude wants a new rug. Walter and The Dude take a trip to the rich Lebowski's. They get more than a rug. It appears that someone has kidnapped Lebowski's daughter and the wealthy bigwig wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. The Dude agrees, and, of course, chaos ensues.
Some of the material falls flat. A subplot about a bowling maniac named Jesus (John Turrturo) goes absolutely nowhere. Fortunately, many scenes work wonderfully, featuring original ideas, thought-provoking metaphors, experimental camera techniques, and eye-popping cinematography. I especially enjoyed how the film explores the Dude's dreams with sequences bursting with color, imagination, and peculiar images. Audiences will remember 'The Big Lebowski' as one of the most imaginative films of the decade. The Coen brothers create an odd assortment of unique circumstances and characters. The quirky characters have lots of fun with the unbelievably profane, (Screenit.com informs us that the movie uses the 'F' word 250+ times!), but strangely amusing dialogue.What does it all add up to? Well, there is plenty to think about and plenty to laugh at, but we do not leave with a powerful feeling of satisfaction. 'The Big Lebowski' may resemble the spirit of 'Raising Arizona,' another wildly funny comedy by the Coen's, but this movie's does not quite work as well. Both contain the same zany style, but that film felt inspired by plot. 'The Big Lebowski' lacks plot. A string of amusing predicaments does not necessarily account for the absence of story.  If the film would have followed a clear, comprehensible story, it may have been more involving, but that's clearly not what the Coen brother's wanted. Even before the opening credits begin, the film's narrator (Sam Elliot) explains that this film is about the Dude's adventures. It's not really a narrative of the Dude, but an examination of his reaction to life changing events. By the end of the movie, we sense the Dude has learned from his experiences, and because of them, he is a better personwell, kind of.",7,2,11,25 October 2001
Fight Club," Brutal, aggressive, inquisitive, and insightful. *** out of ****.
","FIGHT CLUB / (1999) ***Viewing 'Fight Club,' the new drama by assertive director David Fincher, is like walking through graffiti-laden streets of a crime-ridden suburban city; it is dark, brutal, gritty, troublesome, and hostile. This film is all of those things, but in this circumstance I use such adjectives to the production's credit. 'Fight Club' is a coarse, unpleasing journey into the lives of its narcotic characters, but it is for those exact same reasons why I find myself recommending the movie to audiences with strong stomachs. If this film was anything but what I have already described, we would be appalled at such deserving controversy and violent content contained. The hostility of  'Fight Club' is the main factor of which why it succeeds; the raucous style contributes in making a convincing, entertaining, and recklessly original story.Edward Norton stars as the movie's narrator, an insomniac spending his petty days working in an office and sleepless nights seeking out clinics in which he provides comfort to those less fortunate than he. One of the people he meets is an overweight but gentle pedestrian named Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), a victim of testicular cancer. He also meets a sleazy, foul-mouthed drifter like himself named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).Norton's character development is quite unusual; although effective and versatile, the introduction, as is with the rest of the movie, is extremely bleak. It is as if the characters are creating an anti-society story through some perverse behaviors. We witness the movie through the Narrator's point of view, who ends up explaining more of the plot than necessary.During a plane flight, our undervalued narrator encounters a cocky and well-dressed soap sales representative named Tyler Durden (Brat Pit), whose sarcastic and outspoken notions create a charisma between both individuals. Shortly afterwards, the Narrator's apartment blows apart, leaving him nowhere to seek shelter but with Tyler. This enigmatic man then organizes an underground sensation called Fight Club, in which young men inquire pleasure out of beating each other into bloody carnage. This secret society, located in the basement of a local bar, allows its members to find self-discovery and freedom through brawls and scuffles.'Fight Club' is crafted stirringly from structured innovation to production designs. Art director Chris Gorak, production designer Alex McDowell, and cinematographer Jeff Cornenweth capture the film's subversive atmosphere with vivid detail and descriptive style and dazzling lighting techniques. Costume designs by Michael Kaplan contribute to the development of Tyler Durden with distinctive, creative outfits.David Fincher is currently one of my favorite directors. His striking and suspenseful thrillers 'The Game' and 'Seven' captured my attention thoroughly with sharp characters and focused narratives. 'The Game' detailed a wealthy executive immersed in confederacy who must overcome a variety of challenges to survive. 'Fight Club' is more or less the same topic, in which a rebellious benefactor assists in taking charge of his lack of freedom through violent encounters. This production contains plot twists and a climatic resolution that may require more reasoning and thought than the majority of an audience will be willing to submit.'Fight Club' contains enough extreme graphic violent content for several movies, yet few characters end up with severe injuries. When a tough young man beats someone's face into the ground, resulting in so much gore he is hardly recognizable, you would expect that person to end up in critical condition at the hospital. However, many characters in this movie engage in uncultivated attacks but appear in modest condition the following day. I guess this movie centers more on its theme than the character's actual course of action, which is obligatory for success.Brad Pitt captures Tyler Durden with a macho, politically incorrect attitude; he is the right choice for his character, with a hunky physical appearance and appropriate style, this is one of the actor's career peak performances. Edward Norton proves he is more qualified in productions like this and 'American History X' rather than light-hearted romantic comedies like 'Keeping The Faith.' He apprehends the difficult character with proficiency and sophisticated detail.'Fight Club' is one of the more difficult movies I have reviewed in quite a while. With its contentious messages, studio hype, audience anticipation, and the actual film itself, you are reading a strenuously written critique. My reaction to this movie was a mixture between startling amazement and baffling perplexity, furthermore, 'Fight Club' is a production containing ideas audiences will be discussing long after its finale; it is the kind of movie that may require seconds helpings for some inquiring viewers.",8,0,2,14 June 2000
Memento," Not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original. ***1/2 (out of four)
","MEMENTO / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	How is this for a scenario? A man breaks into your house in the middle of the night. He kills your wife and leaves you with brain injuries. Furious, you pledge your life to track down and kill whoever is responsible. There is just one problem: after the head injury, you are no longer capable of creating new memories; everything before the accident is crystal clear, but now you cannot remember anything past several minutes.	Now chew on this: what happens to guilt if you cannot remember what you did? How can a person have emotions if he does not know where they came from? How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?
	'Memento' wins this year's prize for inducing the most audience participation. Not only is the film thought-provoking and unusually absorbing, but it also places us in the main character's shoes. How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.	Other characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from 'The Matrix'), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from 'The Matrix'), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard's experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard's. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.  	'Memento' is smart and imaginative. It doesn't pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information. In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film's actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot. 'Memento' is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-'Memento' doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. 'Memento' is one of the year's most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original.",8,203,307,2 May 2001
Alien: Resurrection," A little to gory, and too few scary moments. ** out of ****
","ALIEN: RESURRECTION (1997) **Starring: Sigourney, Winona Ryder, Dominique Pinon, Ron Perlman, and Gary Dourdan Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet   Running Time: 109 Minutes   Rated R (for strong gruesome sci-fi violence and gore, and for language)
By Blake French:	'Alien Resurrection' does not carry the tradition brought to us with 'Alien,' years ago. This film is contrived, flat, and relies heavily on special effects and enormously gruesome creature attacks to pull the movie through a lengthy running time of nearly an hour and fifty minutes. Sure, the visual atmosphere, special alien effects, and science fiction action are all impressive, and I liked much of the film thanks to those elements. I did not care for the movie, however, for many reasons. Mainly due to the absence of a story line beyond scene after scene of violent behavior. 
	The story takes place 200 years after the last 'Alien' movie. Ripley has been cloned from a drop of her blood and is still the main character. All this takes place on a massive space ship, where the government wishes to breed alien for medical reasons.  Most of the movie takes place on a freighter ran by a homeless crew. Something goes wrong, aliens break out of their restraints, and wreak havoc on most of the members of the crew. However, they have Ripley with them to explain what is going on. One of the group members is named Annalee Call (Winona Ryder), whose identity may not be what it seems. She and the rest of the band are placed in situation after situation with a simple gimmick of how they must reach their way back to earth without aliens on board. Most of the production is spent detailing these situations, and at times, perhaps in a little too much detail. 
	Some of the film's violence gores a little over the edge at times. Lets say an individual excepts the fact that aliens tare off and or crush victims' heads frequently, as well as doing their gobble de gook scare scenes when they kill no one. There are even murder scenes under water, obviously taking some pointers from 'Jaws.' And the stomach churning suction sequence in space where the aliens and the last of the remaining humans are placed on a shuttle, will stick with you long after the ending credits roll by. This is not a movie for the faint of hear, young, or squeamish.Most of the performances were modicum satisfactory, but none were anything noteworthy. Sigourney Weaver is surely running out of energy with the Alien series, and seems a bit lost here. Winona Ryder suffers from the exact same syndrome. Her character inhabits such a big twist near the end of the film, it is a shame that it isn't very effective. Since characters are such in lacking of humanity, and the aliens are so brilliantly crafted, it is hard not to root for the monsters here.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.",4,3,11,3 December 1999
The 13th Warrior," Tense battle sequences--poorly developed script and characters. ** out of ****.
","THE 13TH WARRIOR (1999) **Starring: Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Vladimir Kulich, Omar Sharif, and Anders T. Andersen Director: John McTiernan   Co-written and directed by Michael Crichton 114 minutes   Rated R (for brutal warfare violence and gory carnage)By Blake French:Michael Crichton is a very good writer. Way too good for being responsible for much of the production of 'The 13th Warrior,' a brutal Viking film in which everything is first rate except the characters and the story. True, the film does contain a few moments of suspense and tension that work well. However, nothing in this movie even remotely compares to any of his past work, such as 'Jurassic Park' or 'Sphere.' Also, director John McTiernan, who has also contributed his direction to some great movies, such as the original 'Die Hard,' is completely lost in Crichton's story here, which, in a way, leads to a directional conflict that is almost like the blind leading the blind.Antonio Banderas stars as a humble Arab poet named Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, Ibn for short, who lives a pretty normal 18th century life until he is chosen, along with twelve other brave men, to defend a king's plummeting kingdom from vicious, unknown slaughters who consumer the dead. His life dramatically changes as he defends his leaders and his own life by fighting off these man-eating beasts.  Finding out who the villains are in this movie is truthfully the only reason to even consider going to the multiplex to see it; they are mysterious and devilish. Part of their identity is revealed in a dramatic war sequence that gives away the wrong information at the wrong time. If only the filmmakers offered an answer to this provoking question: we never actually find out who they are or where they come from. Too bad, if the audience was provided with answers, we may have had something a little bit noteworthy here.Another problem I had with 'The 13th Warrior' has to do with its plot, which was seemed to be absent for much of the film. The characters are good speakers; they explain most of the story to us, with simple and blank dialogue that doesn't include any dramatic impulse in its being--the plot is never directly shown. This dialogue is also used to develop most of the characters. Banderas is detailed though some neat flashbacks, but not even those scenes will make you care about any of the characters.
There is much to like about the production, however. The battle sequences build up enough tension to make them work well, mostly because of the mystery of the villains. There is a nice (meaning the scene works, not that the scene is 'nice') scene in a cave near the end of the film that has lost of smart material in its writing--but again, we just don't care about any of the characters; it is hard to build up tension if we don't care about who lives or who dies. In addition, there is a tremendously over-looked production design  worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Antonio Banderas delivers a good performance, one that fits the lead role so perfectly that I myself could not have chosen another actor to fit the role better. His character is too shallow to give recognition to, but Banderas does what he can to make his character bearable. I do believe that 'The 13th Warrior' was destined to succeed. If the writers would have done  what they should have done, considering the potential here, this film would have surely worked. There are  many ways that would have made this material work. For instance, Antonio Banderas stars as a brute, powerful leader of thirteen warriors who are forced into defending their king's fortune. Or perhaps, Antonio Banderas as the leader of a band of scavengers numbering thirteen who are somehow selected to protect their territory from the legendary 'eaters of the dead.' But how in God's green Earth could one take such clever potential and write a story starring Antonio Banderas as some meek, insignificant Arab poet who is chosen by some unknown, distant king to fight for a dyeing nation and protected its citizens from man-eaters whose presence is never explained?

The Mummy," Never Convincing or Emotional, but with great effects. **1/2 out of ****
","'The Mummy' is a clone of the 'Indiana Jones' series that blends adventure with plot twists and first rate suspense. While 'The Mummy' does accomplish a thing or two with a neat computer animated 'mummy,' it just doesn't quite work. It's like the old saying goes that it is one thing to respect something, and it is another to like it. I do respect the filmmakers who were hard at work making this production, but something about it was almost repetitive and never truly convincing.There is a story here, it often is unfocused and drifts off from a real point of view, but there is a story nonetheless. It follows the adventures of two brothers, a librarian, several researchers who seemingly have no recollection of consequences that evolve from their mistakes, and a couple other side characters that have no purpose in the film but to become a human victim of a non-human creature who will pick his prey one by one when they are separated from the rest of the clan.  See the formula we are up against; how can we care about the characters when we have already seen these so many more times before hand.The director is Stephen Sommers, who obviously prefers to introduce his characters, then start right off with the plot. We know this because his last film, 'Deep Rising,' also did the same with its story. I don't think this method quite works. It brings forth many unneeded characters, who in turn we know they will be killed in the order where the whimsy ones go first, then the side character whom we do not know their names; the typical horror film formal. 'The Mummy' is definitely an improvement over the last movie he directed, but again, just isn't persuasive enough to actually be recommended by myself.The setup takes too long for Sommers to setup. The narrator explains most of the ritualistic events to us at the beginning rather than show us, which makes it very hard to understand. The characters are well developed, while every one of them was obvious in their motives immediately. There are plenty that die, few that live, and a whole lot of boredom in the first twenty minutes while they are introduced.   And lets not forget the overwhelming, vast and good-looking desert in which much of film is shot in. The atmosphere is another great element in this movie, which is eerie and spooky, but never actually terror provoking.Brendon Frasier was a good goof in 'George of the Jungle,' 'Blast From The Past,' and several other comedies he has been in the last few years. However 'The Mummy' is supposed to be scary, suspenseful, and shocking, not comic. This is yet another example of an actor with humorous potential putting it to use when he is supposed to be quite serious. Frasier doesn't even come close with hitting the mark here, mimicking Harrison Fords sense of humor from 'Indiana Jones,' he just does not have what it takes to be a serious actor.'The Mummy's' mummy was horrific in the most dastardly of ways. It was gruesome, scary and head tuning. I just wish that he looked like a mummy. For by the time this movie is over, the only mummy left to do the killing is a muscular actor in full flesh. Can't they even live up to the title?",6,0,0,18 May 1999
The Others," Very suspenseful, great performances, effective atmosphere--but the timing is way off. *** (out of fur)
","THE OTHERS / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	It must be difficult making a movie like 'The Others,' when the entire plot is based on one final twist. The filmmakers know what that twist is, and it's probably tough keeping it a secret. Take 'The Sixth Sense,' 'The Game,' or  'Fight Club,' for instance.  The actors know they are playing character's with a special surprise in store for them, but their characters don't. The performances must stay true to the story after the final twist is revealed, but must not foreshadow what is in store for us in the final scenes. 	'The Others' has another one of those endings that makes you want to see the movie again just to see if everything adds up correctly. Unfortunately, most people won't have the patience to sit through it for a second time. The film, directed, composed, and written by Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amendabar, contains a convincing atmosphere and knows how to build tension the audience can cut with a knife, but the timing is off. It makes us wait way too long for something to happen that will relieve the fog-thick suspense.   	 The film takes place on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of World War II, where a young woman awaits the return of her husband who went to war when his country needed him. Nicole Kidman plays this quiet, subtle woman, named Grace, who spends her days and night taking care of her children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) in her gorgeous Victorian mansion. She hires a new trio of house servants to replace the crew who mysteriously disappeared. Then strange things begin to happen. Grace's daughter explains that she has been communicating with an unseen boy. At first, Grace does not believe her child, but when Grace herself starts to hear strange noises, and witness unusual events, she also questions the possibility of an intruder inside her home. 	'The Others' lingers for a long time. It does get under our skin and create a strong, spooky mood, similar to that of the old-fashioned haunted house movies. The film makes us believe we are in a dark, lonely house, and that someone, or something, may be inside with us. Nicole Kidman's performance is contagious. She infects the audience with Grace's fear and suspicion. Easily one of the year's best performances, Kidman stirs the terror with a gripping, uneasy edge. The supporting actors do not steal the scenes from Kidman, she deserves the focus, but they still give her enough material to react to. 	It's too bad that more doesn't happen in the movie. 'The Others' eventually becomes redundant-it's scene after scene of Grace walking through dark rooms and closing the blinds to her house-her children are allergic to the light (a plot element that doesn't contribute much to the story). The film also stumbles when a specific character enters the picture-the event is highly anticipated, but the movie doesn't know what to do when it happens. It's worth seeing because of the final revelation, the spookiness of the atmosphere, and the performance by Kidman. Alejandro Amendabar must think that with a story like this, the less you reveal, the more suspenseful it is. 'The Others' proves a different theory: less is not more-more is more.",8,2,4,5 September 2001
Chicken Run," Animation at its best, with outstanding characters and a clever story. ***1/2 (out of four)
","CHICKEN RUN / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)	'Chicken Run,' DreamWorks Picture's newest animation festival, is an old-fashioned fairy tale with more heart and truth than most movies can even imagine about containing. The film's animated style contains state-of-the-art clay-animation techniques, which make it worth the trip to the multiplex just for feasting your eyes on such brilliant special effects. Directors Peter Lord and Nick Park, with co-writer Karey Kirkpatrick, give the characters depth, reason, and dimension-even if the main star is a feathered farm animal that converges with his companions about political matters. 	'Chicken Run' details the miserable lives of a clan of chickens being withheld within a sinister dairy farm in 1950's England. Ginger (voiced by Miranda Richardson) is the central character, who, along with her acquaintances, deeply lust for the sweet smell of freedom that lies beyond the constricting boundaries of their pens. The unhappy farm owners, the smart and devious Mrs. Tweedy and the dumb and precarious Mr. Tweedy, brutally dispose of chickens who fail to produce the amount of eggs they require.  	When a overzealous circus Rooster named Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson) stumbles onto the farm one evening, the other chickens blackmail him into teaching them how to escape. This is also when the Tweetys lurch up a devilish new plan to strike it rich by purchasing a machine that will turn innocent chickens into merchandising pot pies. 	The film's plot is steady, solid, and knowing; it portrays a series of events that gradually build tension eventually inducing an exciting climax that is both conclusive and satisfying. 'Chicken Run' is a precise piece of filmmaking, an inoffensive family adventure that will entertain audiences of all ages. Regardless of how well crafted it is or how artful the material, the movie is about chickens escaping out of their pen in order to find genuine independence. No, the stakes are not nearly high enough, and with a plot like this, it is only natural for some audiences to expect a shallow, cheap cartoon publicity stunt. However, the filmmakers make this movie feel original, fresh, suspenseful, and involving, regardless if the main characters are chickens with patriotic instincts.",8,23,29,3 August 2000
X-Men," Special effects galore, but where's everything else? *1/2 (out of four)
","X-MEN / (2000) *1/2 (out of four)    It is never a good sign when a movie features a theatrical trailer more entertaining than the movie itself, but Bryan Singer's 'X-Men,' the live action version of the outdated cartoon, is as disposable and lightweight as its characters on helium. The film brings new meaning to the art of science fiction, where it attempts to portray futuristic ideas in human evolution without drastically changing the world around them. There is no explanation behind the movie's concepts, that become lost in an overzealous and dramatically disappointing script.      The story takes place in 'the not so distant future,' where the government considers mutants, people with extraordinary powers, a threat to society. U.S. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is proposing a plan to expose these individuals to the public. Although most mutants are decent, ordinary, law-abiding citizens, Kelly feels others have the right to be informed about their powers and potential dangers. 
    Humanity has greater concerns, however, like continuing their ordinary existence. Magneto (Ian McKellen), the aging but magnetism controlling madman who believes humans are mutant's nemesis and his gang, including Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), fierce and beast-like, Toad (Ray Park), who has abilities similar to his namesake species, and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can transform into anyone, plan on conquering the planet with complex technology.      There is the good hearted professor, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the handicapped but telepathic leader of the X-Men, a group of mutants bent on peace between humans and themselves. He owns a school for the mutants and among his longtime students is Cyclops (James Marsden), a young man with laser-firing eyes, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who has telekinetic powers, and Storm (Halle Berry) who is able to control the weather. Newcomers Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a man with retractable claws and the ability to heal himself quickly, and Rouge (Anna Paquin), a young, confused teenage girl that drains the power from anyone she touches, are quickly woke up to the dangers of their counterparts and his plan to seek total denomination. 	 As in all superhero movies, we expect big, explosive special effects, heart-pounding action, and a final confrontation between the head honchos of both good and bad sides. 'X Men' adequately provides all but the later, which ultimately leads to the film's horrible conclusion, naturally setting up for a sequel. However, where can the story go from where this one leads off. The filmmakers have no choice but to place the variety of diabolical characters in a world-threatening situation for our succeeding heroes to return to duty.  I dread the day 'X-Men II' hits theaters, surely only to spark quick commercial success in the box office, but then efficiently be flushed through the drain of forgotten Hollywood cinema.  'X-Men' opened to sensational success in the box office (well over 50 million) undoubtedly due to the big time summer anticipation of the film. With such a star-studded cast, including hot young stars James Marsden and Anna Paquin, as well as older, more sophisticated performers like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, how can audiences expect little of the production. Bryan Singer, who so vividly directed 'The Usual Suspects,' also precedes to undividedly disappoint us with unfocused direction and a style not even die hard 'X Men' fans will enjoy. Not coincidentally, the very expensive production quickly lost interest with audiences (plummeting over fifty percent in its second weekend in release). As this movie proves, American audiences can continue to confidently rely on word of mouth.",3,3,8,13 September 2000
Sleepy Hollow," A visual masterpiece, pure Tim Burton. ***1/2 out of ****
","SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) ***1/2Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken Director: Tim Burton   Running Time: 102 minutes   Rated R (for graphic horror violence and gore, and brief sexuality)By Blake French:	Tim Burton is just about as good as they get in the movie business when it comes to creating an atmospheric world to inhabit specific characters. 'Sleepy Hollow' is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch; it resembles the best of Burton in every way. In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, he captures the slumbering, creepy village of Sleepy Hollow with vivid details and imaginative description. The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the years most captivating and magical film experiences.
	Some of the visual credit should also be given to the film's Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the credited production designer, Rick Heinrichs. These elements contribute a great deal of success to Burton's masterpiece. Both the design and Cinematography are some of the best seen all year, and deserve a hard earned Oscar Nomination. They make the film intriguing and visually stimulating. 	The film takes place in the late 1700's, in New York. Constable Ichabod Crane, a timid and but smart man played by Johnny Depp, is assigned to investigate a series of grizzly murders in a nearby town called Sleepy Hollow. He's rather concerned about his latest task, however, due to the content of the killings. The victim's heads have been sliced, in one clean sweep, straight from their bodies. He accepts his duties, and travels by horse and carriage to the isolated village. 	Once Ichabod arrives, the locals, including Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), and Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), greet him with eagerness. They explain the legend of the headless horseman, who is supposedly causing the murders in their town. At first he is skeptical. Then, after witnessing a victim losing their head personally, he arrives at the conclusion that a headless horseman is responsible for the tragic catastrophes accruing. Ichabod soon meets Katrina Van Tassel, an innocent looking, self spoken young woman who may have some advice, as well as several secrets of her own.	The Headless horseman is a perfect portrayed villain for 'Sleepy Hollow.' He is brute, oversized, and roughly textured with outwear. The actor who brings him to life when his head is on is perfect for the role; Christopher Walken. For some odd reason, however, popular film critic Roger Ebert reluctantly refused to tell his readers the name of the actor, thinking it would give something away. Well, I am sorry, Mr. Ebert, but it isn't that hard to find this information elsewhere. The filmmakers are not trying to hold Walken as a secret. Stating he stars as the headed horseman gives nothing away. One must see his performance and make up for themselves to even imagine what material the film's bad guy brings forth.
	Tim Burton's direction is focused and wonderfully observant here. The murder sequences are gory and violent, but never way over the top. Burton never losses sight of his main characters, has a good idea about what he wants to place in film, and the special effects do not distract his ability to do so. He has a knack for allowing an audience to become involved with his pictures. We must think for ourselves, figuring out nuggets of the plot on our own, without the projectors help. He has demonstrated these techniques before in such films as 'Edward Scissorhands,' 'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' and even the best Batman film yet, 'Batman Returns.' 
	Johnny Depp offers an Oscar worthy performance as Ichabod Crane. He brings the squeamish role to life effortlessly with striking details and perfect form. He is flawlessly cast, as well as Christina Ricci, who also acts with style and poignancy. Compliments also go out to splendid costuming the actors are permitted to wear. 	Although 'Sleepy Hollow' offers lots of creepy impressions, the film is far from being very scary. Some moments do generate some minor thrills, but for the most part, the production is not as terrifying as it could have been. Much of it lacks momentum and build-up for the dozen or so graphic beheadings that take place. Burton could have easily loaded his picture with bombarding amounts of shock value, suspense, and tension filled fright, but instead goes for all out violence, plot, and mystery. Not that this effects the overall production. This is more of an atmospheric movie than a scream feast. The atmosphere is certainly above the average. 	The conclusion of 'Sleepy Hollow' works in a bizarre, but unpredictable fashion. The climax occurs unexpectedly and excitingly, with much surprise and special effects. The film's foreshadowing is effective, but regardless of how experienced of a filmgoer you are, this is one ending that is not meant to be figured out before it takes place. It is one of the preferred closings I've seen in a while. Despite a few personal objections, 'Sleepy Hollow' is a brilliantly crafted work of art--one of the years better films.

The Beach," Visually effective, but lacks narrative conflict and character structure. *1/2 out of ****.
","THE BEACH / (2000) *1/2Rated R (for strong language, violence, sexuality, and drug use).
According to many intelligent screenwriters, directors, and us critics, conflict is the basis of all drama. If there is no problem for the main character to solve or something for him or her to achieve, there is no purpose for the character's state of being. Without character we can have no story. Without story we can have no movie. The new sexy, glamorous novel adaptation from 'Trainspotting' director Danny Boyle, runs into that rare, insidious flaw: other than some irrelevant singular character tensions, there isn't much conflict in its plot. The film primarily consists of a slew of related events placed side by side. Thus, many of the scenes do not propel the story forward. The conclusion doesn't even know where to commence because there is nothing to explicate.The filmmakers cast Leonardo DiCaprio as a young American traveler named Richard, who, as the movie opens, arrives in Thailand in quest for an adventure that can't be found in the common tourist locations. We don't know a whole lot about Richard except that he is a drifter named Richard. He rationalizes in the premise that nothing else matters, an extremely lazy method for the writers to escape character development. In reality, background information does indeed matter, and for us to care about him, we need to know more.Early in the movie, Richard meets an erotically appealing French woman, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and her boyfriend, Etienne (Guillaume Canet). Soon afterwards, he stumbles upon a pot smoking, insane individual named Daffy. This strange person rambles about a paradise-like island that unseen by most people. Richard believes little this man states, but the next morning he discovers Daffy has killed himself and left him a map leading to this mysterious beach. He asks Francoise and Etienne to travel with him to the island . They accept his invitation.Robert Carlyle doesn't get to do much in this movie but contribute essential plot information required to move the story along. The narrative line uses his character, Daffy, later in the story when Richard slowly becomes disillusioned on the island. This theme of action is effective and developed with strong emotional depth.Once on the island, after discovering that a small potion is run by rigged drug farmers, Richard, Etienne and Francoise meet a secluded group of villagers who have permanently settled there, away from all the worlds' troubles. This picture perfect location is loosely led by a young woman named Sal (Tilda Swinton).The island's beach is truly paradise. The atmosphere is beautifully luxuriant. The filmmakers choose the perfect location for this movie, creating the right visual style. Also contributing to the successful island concepts: the characters develop the place with colorful, momentum building dialogue and pleasant oral description. Because of these measures the writers take with the importance of creating a paradise island, our imaginations are nurtured to believe both internally and visually that this place is almost a heaven.A conflict 'The Beach' runs into is the attempt to fit too much material in one 119 minute movie. It tires to provide us with an illicit love story between the lustful Richard and the attractive Francoise. Thus Etienne provides us with some romantic competition. It also attempts providing us with a secret love affair between Richard and Sal, creating a villain, her boyfriend Bugs. We are also in an adventure film about the findings of drifters. The patrons also enters the mind of a young man whose mind becomes overtaken by his primal instincts. Also, the story about several young American travelers who behold a copy of a map to the island, threatening the native's existence. The plot with the foreign pot smugglers who murder people with assault rifles. We learn of the results of a shark attack and the pains the victims bring upon the group. The list goes on and on. If only the writers would have chosen a concrete subject and expanded on it rather than colliding a dozen different plots, we may have had a better movie.I really enjoyed the visual style in 'The Beach' that is militant and creative. It uses neat camera angles and cinematography to its advantage. Leonardo DiCaprio contributes to film's mood. He performs with the necessary dramatic tensions that fulfil narrative requirements, although his obvious narration ends up explaining much of the story to us.Within the struggling situations  of 'The Beach' lay some very deserving potential. If only the filmmakers would have used the God given gift of imagination, something this movie lacks. In a picture half as good as 'The Beach,' the destructive flaw would be found within the film's conflict, not the lack of conflict being the destructive flaw.Brought to you by Twentieth Century Fox Productions.",4,0,1,10 March 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Shocking to see the material, but is it really entertaining? **1/2 (out of four)
","FULL METAL JACKET / (1987) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:With Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' you get two masterfully constructed movies for the price of one-a movie about boot camp and a movie about Vietnam. Unfortunately, under most circumstances, neither film is worth viewing.It's shocking to watch the risks Kubrick takes with this material. From the opening shots, against a soundtrack featuring 'Goodbye Dolly, Hello Vietnam,' images flash before our eyes of marine recruits getting their heads shaven clean for training camp. Cut to a rude, obnoxious, drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey), shouting curses at these young recruits as he passes down the double aisle of bunks at a basic training camp in Paris Island. 'From now on you'll speak only when spoken to, the first and last words out of your mouth will be sir!' In this segment, we witness the agonizing training sessions and dills that these poor young men must conquer. Most of them do a fine job. All except for a moronic, uncoordinated maggot nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). The personalities of Hartman and Pyle clash like water and oil, or more like fire and propane.Little dialogue exists with in this personality conflict, but there sure is a hell of a lot of screaming and shouting of disgusting insults. I wanted relief from the Sergeant's nonstop obscenity and discrimination. Lee Ermey does wonderful things with his character, but the character is repulsive. He gave me a headache to the extent that I had to turn the movie off momentarily and walk outside to clear my mind and take a few deep breaths of fresh air.Considering a lot of Ermey's dialogue was improvised, I admire phrases like these. This kind of dialogue is great if you're looking for a hard-edged, realistic look at military training camps. But play that same kind of tone and dialogue for over forty-five minutes, then is it really entertaining? Engaging? If you answer yes, then I have just learned things about you I did not want to know.The second segment of 'Full Metal Jacket' takes off when the trained military troops arrive in Vietnam. The movie then disintegrates into a series of detached, self contained war sequences. Most war movies, regardless of how disturbing or graphic, secure at least some rank within my emotions. 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Platoon,' 'Apocalypse Now,' and even 'Tigerland' captured my heart in very different ways, but this movie feels detached to all humanity and spirit. There is nothing harrowing about scene after scene of hopeless characters getting shot to hell if we don't feel for those characters. Kubrick eliminates his only two interesting characters in the first segment, leaving his second segment to shrivel and die.
Although I disliked the film, I admire many things about 'Full Metal Jacket.' The film's serious attitude towards its subjects. Kubrick's ironic message that people produce killers, and that killers are not born, reverses his own stance as seen in 'A Clockwork Orange.' Kubrick's style also shows through; the film's finale holds true to his sardonic sense of theme and moralization. The two films also comment on each other. I never knew the phrase 'I am in a world of shit,' could carry so much impact and meaning. I also liked how Kubrick refrained from glamorizing any aspects of the film. In several juicy sequences, there were distinctive possibilities of sex. While there is sex in the film, Kubrick avoids portraying sex on screen. I think he did this to evade a potential attraction and distraction to the audience.Stanley Kubrick was one of the most vivid, courageous directors that will ever live. He was a perfectionist, always creating a true portrait of his visions. He took risks. Some of them worked, some of them did not. 'Full Metal Jacket' displays a stunning quality of filmmaking; it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in screen writing. But the movie fails to actually entertain and enlighten. I was disappointed in the film. Many audiences will remember Kubrick's portrait of Vietnam as a film that defined a generation, but it's too bad that the film didn't do it entertainingly.",6,1,4,28 June 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Colorful images and great imagination, but one heck of an annoying character. *** (out of four)
","MONSTERS, INC. / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:When I was a kid, I imagined a world of monsters just like the one in 'Monsters, Inc.' I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.  
Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of 'Toy Story' give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as 'A Bug's Life,' and 'Toy Story 2.' From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details. The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing. One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy. 'Monsters, Inc.' works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over. Some audiences will find this character absolutely adorable, maybe even as the film's most distinguished. Though for me, this character almost destroyed the entire movie.  I understand the need for a child to enter Monstropolis, but why couldn't the film have had fun with the idea. Perhaps it could have used a child old enough to understand his circumstances, but young enough to delight in the wonder of his newly discovered world. Instead, the movie gives us a nonsensical plot in which the infant gets herself into one problematic situation after another. This has worked before. In 'Baby's Day Out' we laughed at the accidental irony of the situations. Here, the character gets herself into these situations. She becomes a nuisance even as she initially appears on screen. There is nothing innovative or creative with a young girl running in and out of rooms, yet 'Monsters, Inc.' insists it's funny. The film becomes a one-joke comedy. If you're old enough to cross the street by yourself, you're probably too sophisticated for this humor. Despite this parasite of a character, 'Monsters, Inc.' still manages to come out of the one-joke routine and display a third act of climbing excitement, surprising twists, and entertaining action that will amuse children of all ages. If not for the pesky little girl, this movie might have been one of the most colorfully creative films of the year. All though it is not, 'Monsters, Inc.' does contain enough imagination and colorful images to warrant a trip to the multiplex. But don't say I didn't warn you about the kids. During the screening I attended, jam-packed with children running all around and making noise, I had a little boy sitting behind me that kept kicking my seat. Now that's something I never want to see coming out of my closet.",7,11,25,18 November 2001
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams does his thing well in this comedy that makes us think. ***1/2 (out of four)
","GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM / (1987) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	Robin Williams is about as good as they come at doing stand up comedy, and in 'Good Morning, Vietnam' director Berry Levinson gives him everything he needs to make the film go above and beyond the average satire. From his outgoing sense of humor, to his aggressive personality, and dozens of vocal effects, he portrays his character with interactive zest. Who can resist the awakening voice of Williams on the radio yelling 'Good Morning Vietnam.' This is a film that conquers the test of time.	'Good Morning, Vietnam' tells the story of a lively disc jockey who gets a job on Armed Forced Radio during the Vietnam War. Robin Williams is the fast-talking Adrian Cronauer, and who better to play the part than he. Although this character is one-dimensional (we are never informed on his background, marital status, where he comes from, what he did before we meet), as the movie continues he gradually begins to change into a deeper, more meaningful person.	The story moves along smoothly; the narrative through-line is consistent as each scene relates to the next. Although little momentum or suspense can be noticed, the film does have several underlining themes, often viewed upon in a Stanley Kubrick style: sarcastic and uncompromising. We see how much a little humor and jazz can greatly enlighten the hard-core atmosphere of the military during Vietnam, and how it can thoroughly confuse the bleeding heart officials. 	The film hangs by the skin of its teeth for active conflict tension. Beyond people objecting to the actions of Williams' character, there is just not a lot of tension within the story, and at some points my interest wandered. 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is merely a portrait of Robin Williams releasing his perennial comedy, and unfortunately that does happen to get old quite quickly; the majority of an audience can only watch the humor for so long until it becomes old and somewhat stale.	'Good Morning, Vietnam' is definitely not a flawless film, but we do empathize for the main character, the scenes effectively capture the attitude and mood during the war, and the dialogue and writing feel accurate and involving. Barry Levinson has directed a marvelous comedy, one that is not all about making us laugh, but also makes us think.",8,33,47,14 November 2000

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Way too long, and way too much mumbo-jumbo. The movie abuses it's use of fantasy. A disappointment. ** (out of four).
","THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French:(WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead.)The only thing worse than a bad movie is a bad movie that thinks it is good. The only thing worse than a bad movie that thinks it is good is a three hour long bad movie that thinks it is good.Case in point: 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,' based on the towering trilogy of novels by J.R.R Tolkien. According to this film's production notes, this is one of the most colossal movie productions ever embarked upon, based on one of the most famous trilogies ever written. And you though 'Harry Potter' had big expectations  One of the biggest movie productions ever embarked upon? That's certainly a big statement-but I believe every word. It has taken four decades for cinema technology to reach the level of sophistication to bring this story to life. Everything about the film is B-I-G. It took over one-hundred million dollars to bring the vision to life, and this is only the first installment of three. Even the film's production notes-that embody 20 pages of single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font-are of the longest I have seen. Peter Jackson, the film's director, has vowed to make three motion pictures simultaneously to capture Tolkien's lengthy epic in its entirety.
LOTR thinks it is hot stuff, too. With amazing special effects, astonishing makeup, impressive costumes, dazzling sets, and a production crew big enough to occupy every hotel room in Chicago, it would be easy to let all the glamour get to your head. Case in point: The film took home a whole pile of Golden Globe nominations. It's currently ranked as the best movie of all time on the Internet Movie Database. It will surely break box office records, setting a new standard for film adaptations. Sure, the film's technical aspects are vastly elaborate, the characters well cast, and the special effects amazing. So, what else do you expect from a big budget extravaganza like this? How about a story that does not find itself distracted with every step? Or characters that are not puppets of the plot? Is it really too much to ask for a movie to obey the guidelines it sets for itself. I guess so. The screenplay, by Jackson, Frances Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, seems to calculate every move out of a strict book of rules. Unfortunately, this book is like the English language-it appears to have an exception for every single rule. In this movie, anything can happen at anytime-as long as it doesn't interfere with the plot. This makes it quite difficult to take the movie seriously.In this part of the trilogy, a shy young hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a ring-but it's no ordinary ring. It is really an instrument of absolute power that could allow a grumpy old wizard to rule the planet. Frodo and a loyal fellowship of hobbits, men, a wizard, a dwarf, and an elf vow to take a journey to destroy the ring. To rid the world of this treacherous jewelry, they must travel across Middle-Earth to the place where it first was first created. Of course, the entire course of future history is entwined with the fate of the fellowship.Actually, it's quite humorous of what this movie makes us buy. There is an old wizard man who escapes a towering prison by summoning an enormous bird to rescue him-at the last minute, of course. Where is this great and powerful bird when the character later falls to his doom in a deep, treacherous cave? Then there's the old evil wizard. The movie makes it obvious that this being possesses mighty powers. Powers so great he can throw a full-sized person across a large room using only his thoughts. He can even make a bolt of lightning strike a snow-covered mountain, creating a destructive avalanche. LOTR convinces us this character can do just about anything. So why doesn't this diabolical warlock just rid himself of the Fellowship of the Ring? Strike them dead with a lightning bolt? Crush them with a big rock? I will tell you why, because that would be too simple-after all, we need a three hour movie out of this installment alone. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' plays like the big fat novel it is based on. We can almost see the page turning. The chapters arriving. There are many moments of silence, where the character's process what seems like pages of thoughts. The dialogue often sounds like written English. We listen to tons of mumbo jumbo about spirits, magic, power, evil, good, and, of course, rings. Much of it is hard to buy, even if you suspend disbelief. One scene actually inspires giggles. Two old cripples take part in a vicious supernatural battle, where their bodies fly across rooms, slamming into walls and hard, pointy objects. A simple punch should knock such a person out permanently-but these are wizards, or, more importantly, characters in this movie. Death is only real when the screenplay requires it to be. During another battle between a big, fiery monster, all of a sudden, it is possible for the old man to die. It's difficult to review a movie when it is only the first installment of a three-part series, and it's even more difficult when you have no previous knowledge about the book or the outcome of the story. Perhaps, years down the road, after I watch the rest of the installments, I will look back and understand this movieBut I doubt it. LOTR bored me to death. The best way to tell if a book adaptation really works it to ask if the movie makes you want to read the material it is based on. Before watching LOTR, I was inspired by the great hype, and considered read Tolkien's towering novels. After watching this movie, I would not read any of the author's books if they were the last novels on the face of the planet. I fear the next two productions in this dreadful series. We can only hope they're not three hours long!",5,3,6,26 December 2001
Cast Away," Good performance by Tom Hanks, good sequences on the deserted island, but the movie really only succeeds by a margin. *** (out of four)
","CAST AWAY / (2000) *** (out of four) By Blake French:(this comment on 'Cast Away' does contain material of a spoiling nature).'Cast Away' starts on a fairly entertaining note, but devolves into a contrived love story and becomes buried in tedious sequences in which its characters have nothing to do. The main character spends most of the movie's dreadfully long running time alone on a desolate island-but we determined from trailers and TV ads that the character is retrieved after four years, which kind of eliminates the tension of whether or not he will get off the island alive. Tom Hanks plays Nick Noland, a systems engineer for Federal Express who intends to wed his long time girlfriend, Kelley (Helen Hunt), after he returns from a business trip over the south Pacific. We are not surprised when his plane encounters a horrible storm. During one of the most intensely convincing crash sequences ever made, the aircraft plummets into the ocean below, miles off course. Nick is the sole survivor, finding a resting place on a deserted tropical island. Time passes, he builds shelter, losses hope, but nonetheless survives. If you are not aware of his eventual rescue after four years, then you are not among the movies target audience. The story really focuses on Nick starting his life over and overcoming extreme odds. He finds out that Kelley became married and the rest of society has assumed his death. Nick's determination is encouraging, but the movie needs more detailing survival on the island. The scenes on the island are the movies best. The film is very careful not to become idle. There are constantly new situations and conflicts being introduced, even though their scenes are often slow moving and tedious. Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as the only real character in the film, all other's are plot devices. There are a few attempts to introduce side characters, but in a movie like this that is nearly impossible, although the actors do a reasonable job with what little screen time they behold.Director Robert Zemekis stays focused on a consistent narrative instead of going back and forth between characters, like the mediocre 'Six Days, Seven Nights.' This is a thought-provoking situation, but most of us already know how the plot concludes. The actual conclusion itself is actually dissatisfying and inconclusive. 'Cast Away' is still a good production, well made, and beautifully crafted. I liked the directors consistent style and focused narrative, the plane crash sequence, and I give the film a marginal recommendation.",7,7,18,13 March 2001
Pitch Black," A visually stunning piece of work, with one flaw too many. ** out of ****.
","PITCH BLACK / (2000) **Starring: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, and Simon Burke Directed By David N. Twohy. Written by Jim and Ken Wheat. Running time: 108 minutes. Rated R (for violence and language).By Blake French: 	'Pitch Black' probably combines over a dozen horror clinches and surprisingly ends up providing us with a premise that is somewhat original. The only reason it fails is because, of all the recycling this film attempts, it forgets to include message, moral, and depth. The concepts are too simplified. This requires the audience to park their brains at the theater entrance before they will be able to thoroughly enjoy the production.  Whenever a story requires no logic or thought, the writers, Jim and Ken Wheat, show sings of laziness. If they cared about the film's overall theme they would have further developed certain conflicts, characters, and notions in a method that relates to the story. That would demand hard work and long hours, however, and that is something the 'Pitch Black' filmmakers would rather replace with special effects and computer animated visuals. 'Pitch Black' takes place in the future as a high tech space ship blasts through the outermost layers of the galaxy. This space vessel is carrying an assortment of passengers. Most of these characters have one syllable names that are easy to shout out loud. They include Fry (Radha Mitchell), a determined woman and unwilling leader after the captain is killed, Johns (Cole Hauser), a morphine addicted  bounty hunter, Imam (Keith David), a Muslim who coexists with three youthful pilgrims, Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), an antique merchant, Shazza (Claudia Black), a geologist, Jack (Rhianna Griffith) an influential teenager, and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a muscular convicted killer who has night vision. 	As the movie opens, the space craft crashes on an obsolete planet where there appears to be no food or water. (We never really learn what made the vessel plummet to an uncharted land mass, or receive much character development.) The survivors then learn that Riddick, whose intentions may be murderous, has escaped from concealed captivity. The crew then discovers the remains of a desolate assortment of people who may have crash landed here around twenty years ago. Without further ado, an unknown creature mutilates a crew member. They later learn that aliens inhabit the planet but are afraid of the light. So, no problem, right. How can carnivorous invertebrate that are terrified of bright substances cause a threat in a world with three suns? The filmmakers place the characters in a time era in which a solar eclipse is prone to occur. Their only hope: racing across the planet to find several fuel cells that belong to a spacecraft that will take them out of their horrible experiences. 	Isn't it kind of coincidental that the luminous body in which the band collapses contains oxygen; the only mistrusting character is able to see in the dark as a solar eclipse befalls; an eclipse just happens to transpire at the worst time? I also question the aliens' presence. They are frightening and well crafted. However, why do they kill the astronauts? Do they feast upon their physical existence? If so, what did the creatures eat for twenty years after the last victimized crew crash landed. The selected planet contains no vegetation, recourses, other animals, or even water. It is a deserted desert-like landscape. So how do they manage to survive--especially being afraid of light on a planet with three suns? Why do they fear the light? Perhaps they chow on each other? There is a sequence in the film where the aliens attach and kill one another--but why? Nothing here is answered or clarified.
 The characters in 'Pitch Black' are your usual monster movie characters, some lacking personality and interest, and others who have no construction of shape, all whose instincts are instantly obvious. The picture does have enough intelligence to become fearless in its victimizing. It's not alarmed to pick off any of the characters--even some of the big starring roles are killed. I am impressed to witness some decent and well-cast performances here. Although the filmmakers do not take advantage of Vin Diesel's physical composition, he handles the role of a secondary villain with endurance and strength. The rest of the cast also performs with appropriate character traits.There is a sequence in 'Pitch Black' where a mesmerizing collage of spellbinding visual effects makes a solar eclipse. This visually arousing sequence combines of the best technology of special effects I have ever witnessed. The movie is smart with the construction of the aliens, and we are able to induce our imagination a little with those creatures. In a movie of such piercing optical stimulation, however, it should have not wasted time in developing a human conflict, although it interacts with the character twists and adds a nice touch, but evolved more on the interesting alien beings. But 'Pitch Black' does not take advantage of either component.

American Psycho," A great visual and psychological achievement. Christian Bale delivers a knock-out performance. **** (out of four)
","AMERICAN PSYCHO / (2000) **** (out of four)Patrick Bateman: I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. ---'American Psycho'	The average filmmaker would turn 'American Psycho' into an exploitative slasher flick, but Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have adapted the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis into something unique and intriguing, a brilliant, thought-provoking social commentary thriller.Readers criticized the decade old novel because of its graphic violence, but that doesn't cause Turner and Harron to give into the controversial material. I have never read the book, but after watching 'American Psycho,' I intend to. It's a scathing, rare film that probes our imagination and beliefs while experimenting with true psychological terror. It often makes startling switches between scenes of dark comedy and sequences that portray unsettling, graphic images. Director Mary Harron says in the film's press notes that she wanted all but one of the violent sequences to be disturbing. The amount of blood and violence here is certainly extreme, but considering the nature of the beast, not overly abundant. The film calculates every single act of violence, therefore, the victims are seldom random characters, but people we care about, which is why the scenes are so timely and effective.
The best description of the film's main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) comes from Christopher Lehmann-Houpt of The New York Times. 'Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills.'
Both leading actors in 'American Psycho' have previously portrayed Jesus Christ, Willem Dafoe in 'The Last Temptation of Christ,' and Christian Bale in 'Mary, Mother of Jesus.' Talk about versatility. It's probably not a coincidence that Christian Bale was the initial actor of preference for Mary Harron. If an actor can display such a fascinating performance as Jesus Christ, he's more than capable of playing a psychotic serial killer because he already knows the other side of the moral spectrum.
Through the strong central character, 'American Psycho' suggests several themes about the 1980's, including society's obsession with outer perfection, conformity, the rising threshold of material fetishism, and the strong desire of stimulation by drugs, sex, money, and power. Patrick Bateman isn't given a back story, however, and the movie doesn't offer his personal history. Bateman has no inside emotions. He reacts by inner impulse alone. He seeks gratification through the sex and drugs, but also by engaging in the homicidal behavior.    'You could describe American Psycho' as a film about perfect surfaces and what might be lurking beneath,' says Mary Harron. 'Inside, Bateman might want it all to stop, but for him it's a compulsion. He's like the serial killer in M, who says: You have a choice, but I can't help what I am.'''American Psycho' initially earned an NC-17 rating, not because of the violence but because of the graphic sexual content. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three-way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. That's a good thing, if you're not a sensitive viewer, because this film is all about details. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail.
This is a movie that requires more than one viewing, to experience the surreal visual arena, and to justify what we think actually happened. Perplexingly, the film's conclusion puts the events into question. Did Bateman really kill these people, or did he just really want to? The answers don't come easy, but this is a movie that begs us to look closer",10,288,408,7 October 2001
U-571," Everything is external, but there is a lot of action and tension. **1/2 out of ****.
","U-571 / (2000) **1/2 	'U-571' begins with heroic rescues and by the end, lives will be sacrificed, damage will be costly, and everything concludes in a nice sequence as the film's survivors are rescued in the presence of a beautiful sunset. Any movie with a formulaic opening and conclusion like the above lacks thought and originality; this film takes place deep within the sea, but everything else about it is surface shallow. 'U-571' contains many enormous explosions, artistic set designs, tense moments of sheer silence, boisterous battle sequences, non-glorifying shutouts, and memorable camera techniques. Director Jonathan Mostow establishes the film's action to create focused and exhilarative excitement, but he is unable to form depth and intensity within the characters. Their dialogue is not profound or meaningful like the material in 'The Hunt for Red October' or 'Crimson Tide.' There are few internal conflicts to develop personalities or heart; everything is external. Only a handful of scenes in the entire movie have much of an impact at all. But like 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'Crimson Tide,' this production has an enormously believable submarine atmosphere. I liked the movie's appearance and its tension filled moments in deep, dark aquatic zones. Even then, however, there are nothing memorable. The characters lack emotional development as well. There is Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), who feels he is ready to command a submarine, and Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), who believes Tyler is courageous and determined, but is not willing to sacrifice others in the line of duty. American U-boat crew supporting roles go to Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, Jake Weber, Jack Noseworthy, David Keith, and Terrence 'T.C.' Carson. These characters, living in the early 1940s, are summoned to capture the German Enigma Code, which allows the foreigners to communicate their U-boats without alerting the Allies. The German submarines in the North Atlantic are causing trouble. Thus the US Navy team hijacks their ship and kills all enemies on board, only to have their own sub blown sky high by another German battleship. Although this proposition develops the German circumstances, American motives, and briefly introduces each character, the movie takes a lengthy amount of time to set all this up. In its effective ways, the audience becomes concerned for the Americans, and the action scenes are involving, but the story simply has no where to go after achieving its premise. After the Navy crew members become stranded aboard the enemy submarine, the movie represents situation after situation involving noisy combat and shouting characters. Such characters are well acted, especially Matthew McConaughey's. This fine young actor captures Tyler with a clear perspective challenging the audience and creating interest with other characters. Harvey Keitel also performs with dramatically correct intensity. Jack Noseworthy ('Even Horizon,' 'Breakdown') and the rest of the supporting cast offer strong secondary performances, although most of these characters are simple minded and one-dimensional. However, even some of Hollywood's most famous names cannot recover a frivolous script by Jonathan Mostow. Mostow is a talented filmmaker; his last production was 'Breakdown,' the tantalizing thriller starring Kurt Russell and a broken down car. Maybe this filmmaker is better off with his feet on the ground rather than in the water.",6,7,19,11 May 2000
The Shining," One of the scariest movies of all time by one of the best directors of all time. ***1/2 out of ****.
","THE SHINING / (1980) ***1/2Stanley Kubrick is one of the best American directors who ever lived. No recent filmmaker has more effectively depicted ideas and created movies that literally defined generations; such films by Kubrick include '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'A Clockwork Orange,' 'Dr. Strangelove,' and most recently Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the psychosexual thriller 'Eyes Wide Shut.' Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed 'The Shining,' one of the scariest movies ever made. The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.The film stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, father of young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) and spouse to his wife, Wendy (Shelley DuVall). This family is not strongly knitted; never do we see the couple kiss, show tenderness, or make love. Jack used to be an alcoholic and once physically abused Danny. This factor is a major piece in the story's puzzle.As the movie opens, Jack receives a job maintaining a massive hotel in the mountains over the winter. This resort is called the Overlook Hotel. Jack's temporary service will provide his family with extra cash, a wonderfully positioned vacation, and him some quiet time to continue work on his long awaited manuscript. The innkeepers explain to the Torrance's they will be on their own for the upcoming harsh winter season.The Overlook Hotel is a magnificent architectural design. The film's atmosphere alone makes it worthy of recognition. This chosen location is a perfect place for a horror picture to transpire. Along with a haunting atmosphere, the plot also builds momentum through dialogue. These smart variables also vividly promote the vary essence of Nicholson's performance that induces psychological terror. Being stranded in a captivating hotel with a person who has a violent history is a circumstance commendable of true fright.Each scene advances the movie's story into a further depth of tension and develops the characters to a greater level. The gradual increase of Jack's frightening behavior creates a sense of heart-stopping suspense. After an extraordinary setup, when the hotel's radios are destroyed, transportation is taken away, and a colossal snowstorm strands the Torrances in captivity, the sky is the limit for what is in store for them. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not take advantage of the payoff to a movie with a sufficient premise.Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece. His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career. He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth. Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright-inducing intricacy. Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well.Although 'The Shining' is a precarious, well-portrayed adaptation, its conclusion is disappointing in the highest regards. With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this; 'The Shining' does not execute the climax in which it builds.Another problem is with the second half of act two, featuring a assumed hero, Dick (Scatman Crothers), as the film interacts between him and Jack's terrorizing. He is eliminated so quickly, however, we question his existence in the movie period. Furthermore, the 1997 retelling starring Steven Weber better explains Danny's psychological power.'The Shining' is an interesting motion picture to study; I own it. Discovering certain plot twists, analyzing performances, learning from direction techniques, and witnessing haunting atmospheres and tricky camera angles is fun. Most audiences will treasure 'The Shining' for what it offers, but also condemn the film for the method in which it sums itself up.",9,1,2,19 June 2000
American Beauty," The best picture of the year!!! **** out of ****
","AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999) ****> How do you review a movie with as much emotionally harrowing power as 'Amer ican Beauty,' being able to only use words, and still give the film the justice it deserves? It is next to impossible to do. 'American Beauty' is not a comedy, even though it's surprisingly hilarious at times, and contains some very witty and outrageous dialogue. The film is not a drama, nor is ita thriller or an action picture. If the truth be known, 'American Beauty' doesn't fit agreeably into any given category. What this film is; easily the best picture of the year to date. That said, the film isn't for everyone. It isn't a date movie, a feel-good movie, nor is it appropriate to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon. Sam Mendes has constructed a flawless and mesmerizing production that is mature and adult, intended for people who are emotionally effected by movies---and it sure is a beauty. The film centers on one main character, who is going through a mid-life crisis. His name is Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), and at first glance, it may appear that him, his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch from 'Alaska'), have a perfectly happy family life. While things look as if they are going well for the Burnhams, in reality, it's everything but. Lester's fourteen year career is going nowhere. His boss is just about to start layoffs after they decide who is needed and who isn't. And Lester's presence sure isn't required for the company to function properly. His wife is hiding her inner emotions behind a fake smile that she puts on for all her friends. She is having an affair with the opposing real estate agent, Buddy, after learning how much the two of them have in common.His daughter hates him and they barely communicate with each other, not to mention the fact that she is saving up money for breast implants, not that Lester cares about her. His new neighbors are a strict family in which the father, Colonel Fitts, beats his son and hates the fact that he lives right next door to two homosexual lovers. His son, Ricky, is actually a successful drug dealer, whose business later becomes involved with Lester. He is also obsessed with uncovering and videotaping  the beauty in things. 'American Beauty' is the story of Lester's reincarnation. Once he lays eyes on the love of his dreams, one of Jane's best friends at a cheer leading seminar, he instantly wakes up to the world around him. He feels that there is a meaning to his life, and won't let anyone, not his boss, or his wife, or his daughter, take that away from him.Director Sam Mendes pays close attention to each individual character, giving them an inner personality, depth, and most of all, complexity. Lester is the center of the story here, that is obvious. But what precise, detailed emotional characteristics explored with the character here. The result is hypnotic empathy for most of the movie's main characters---who are perfectly cast and wonderfully portrayed.Of course, a character is only as good as the performer playing him or her. In the case of 'American Beauty,' the starring roles are acted by first class performers. I have always been a huge fan of Kevin Spacey, who is most famous for his superb performances in 'Seven,' 'The Usual Suspects,' and 'The Negotiator.' In this film, he defines his character with the right amount of emotional depression and inner complexity needed. Once again, the Oscar goes to Spacey. Annette Bening also has her career high with her performance. She provides the hidden suffering and unhappiness that Carolyn Burnham requires. She fills her with determination and personal respect, all that exists falsely down deep. The actors involved with the Burnham family form the decisive formation of a realistic dysfunctional family. The movie not only triumphs with its characters, design and presentation, but also with the unique and elaborate structure it beholds. The film is held together with conflicts in the narrative through line--a series of events that connect to one other. The internal and external problems are faced within the narrator, Lester. The tensions arise, become more and more complicated, then the issues are solved. But this is not your ordinary climax, here. It is not necessarily unexpected, but when it concludes itself, one would be lucky to walk out of the theater without an emotional reaction---regardless of how heavy it may be. The movie ends how it needs to end. It leaves us with not a message, nor a moral, but a character who has lost everything yet feels the best about himself as he has in the longest time. 'American Beauty' is a rare film. More than just a big production hoping to gross millions of dollars. It is a lot more than that. It is an explanation of  why I love the movies so much.",10,0,0,21 October 1999
The Patriot," Rousing, vigorous, with the strength and conviction of Mel Gibson's performance and the realism of the battle sequences. ***1/2 (out of four)
","THE PATRIOT / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)	'The Patriot' is a rousing, vigorous Revolutionary War epic from the view point of a family full of vengeance and strong wills. Mel Gibson reprises his 'Braveheart' characteristics for a production that shares many common factors, such as frequent and graphic battle sequences that are persuasive, personal, and tragic. He stars as a widower named Benjamin Martin, who contains fond memories of his late wife and is raising several children on a South Carolina estate in 1776. Of course, he is haunted by deep secrets in his past and is an expert on the French and Indian war. King George's taxation without representation is the subject of conflict here, and although Martin believes the policy to be unjust, he wants nothing to do with supporting war with the British. 	Benjamin's oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger in an overzealous performance), goes against his father's strong intentions and joins the rebellion by enlisting as a soldier in the war. Soon a wounded Gabriel returns to his father's plantation as a battle occurs in the front of their livelihood, and the diabolically cruel Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) orders the novice solider to be hanged. In fury one of Benjamin's other children (Gregory Smith from 'Small Soldiers') is killed for interrupting the process, compliments of Tavington. 	Naturally this action triggers an impulse within Benjamin whose rage causes him to switch to battle mode and, with the help of his two younger sons, ambushes the party in charge of Gabriel's hanging. Benjamin then takes up arms against the British and is given the command of a militia. With the help of French warrior Jean Villeneuve (Tcheky Karyo), he marks a full-throated revenge against the man who killed his son, and who changed his previous life.	The film is fond of bridging on emotions such as love, patriotism and betrayal. These emotions are true to the story, and relate well with the audience. There is also some mild comic relief, revolving around simple-minded misunderstandings and character traits. Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' similarly portrayed such humor to ease the tension. But in a movie with as much human depth and tragic occurrences as 'The Patriot,' why would the filmmakers want to induce chuckles. They only decrease the seriousness of the subject matter-although the production is careful not to tread over its head in laughs and foolishness.  	I did see a few excessively familiar clichés within the material of 'The Patriot'; how many times do we really need to see a father raising his children on his own because his spouse passed away a few years earlier. In lesser films I can see where their dim-minded writers would purchase this concept from the marketplace of customary clichés, but when I witness this particular mechanical abstraction in a movie with as much power as this, it is really shameful and sticks out like a sore thumb. 	What really propels 'The Patriot' from being a good movie to being a great movie is the strength and conviction of Mel Gibson's performance and the realism of the battle sequences. Especially in war epics, Gibson is capable of portraying characters of flamboyance and passion, while at the same time can drive the film's many action scenes into excitement and thrills; not many actors can do that, but Mel Gibson can.",9,7,20,25 August 2000
Being John Malkovich," One of the most unique, imaginative movies ever made. **** out of ****
","BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) ****Starring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Orson Bean, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen Director: Spike Jonze   Running Time: 113 minutes   Rated R (for sexuality and language)By Blake French:It is not every day that I use words in my movie reviews such as unique, creative, inventive, imaginative, original, fresh, mesmerizing, and unmatched. Under the circumstances of 'Being John Malkovich,' a wonderfully hilarious presentation of an incomprehensible idea, I find myself using every one of those phrases and then some more being deserved. Everything about it is labyrinthine, intriguing, and very funny. It is one of the years best films, and should be well presented come Academy Award time.
'Being John Malkovich' details the relationship between Craig and Lotte Schwartz. They basically live an old fashioned life in a small apartment with a miniature zoo of pets and a puppet factory inside. Lotte is a typical, unattractive homemaker while Craig holds that unusual occupation of being a professional puppeteer. Desperately searching for employment, Craig soon visits a business for an interview as a filer when he discovers for some odd reason the construction of the office floor is all but several feet tall, forcing all employees to bend over backwards just to walk around.
One of those employees is named Maxine, a highly seductive co-worker of Craig's. When he asks her out for a beer one night, Craig experiences lustful thoughts about her, and nearly begins an affair as his seemingly loving wife wonders around her happy little apartment all by herself.
As you can see, the household isn't exactly a joyful situation. All things change, from blossoming sexual confusion to inner self-esteem, when Craig uncovers a small door behind a filing cabinet in his office. It is tucked away, hidden acutely well in a dark corner, which is found mysteriously by accident when Craig droops a paper behind the cabinet. After Craig explores this deep miniature, seemingly endless hallway, he discovers this secret door leads to the brain of actor John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, then spits you out along the roadside afterwards.Wow, sounds like 'Alice in Wonderland,' doesn't it...well, sort of.  Craig first tells his co-worker about his discovery, who continues to think he's nuts. Then, after explaining and showing this portal to his wife, who is hysterical, Maxine begins to believe Craig, and concoct a devilish idea. To sell tickets allowing a pedestrian to enter the mind of a famous celebrity. The tagline: Ever wanted to be someone else? Now you can.It is very intriguing how the narrative point of view is juggled between Craig and then Lotte after the problem is introduced and then solved: the couples dead-end lives are lifted in glory. This creates a second conflict moving us smoothly into the second act. Perfect internal problems are created with the two female leads; Lotte and Maxine find themselves physically attracted to each other in unbelievable character twists. The two end up having a femininity sexual relationship while one is entrapped in the mind of Malkovich, and the other experiences the actual Malkovich. It is a beautifully crafted structure, with act breaks so clear and complications so faultless it is no wonder while this is such an effective picture.
Also first rate here are the performances. Although the film offers strange types of roles for these actors to indulge themselves in, they do a wonderfully energetic job. Cameron Diaz is flawlessly cast as Craig's sexually and mentally uncoordinated wife, and delivers us a comically riotous character. John Cusack as Craig himself is superior and believable as a down on his luck puppeteer, and possesses a perfect blend of humor and unpredictable qualities with his character. Also quite good here, John Malkovich, who has much more of a difficult role than one would think. He has some hard scenes where Craig controls him while inside his mind, which requires great skill to perform.However, better than any performance, and more amazing then any flawless characters or plot, is the concept of a human being thinking up such an absurd idea as the imagination behind the beauty of 'Being John Malkovich.' With such a penetrating, magical atmosphere to it, it is kind of a shame that the filmmakers created this film in the form of a black comedy instead of something more harrowing. Although comedy is simply the most logical choice to categorize this type of film, wouldn't it have been interesting to see this movie as a drama, or perhaps as a spiritual awakening picture.
Regardless, the film still has an oddly powerful message to it, which I will not, nor do I ever directly reveal in any of my reviews. You see, since different individuals come from different backgrounds, and thus see things differently. It is because of this that I do not allow my personal take on a message persuade another filmgoer whose idea of a moral may be much different than my own. But I will say that 'Being John Malkovich' might not overtake the box office, but for appreciative movie patrons, this one is sure to be treasured for a long time to come.Brought to you by Gramercy Pictures.",9,153,229,28 November 1999
The Fast and the Furious," Yes, it's fast and furious, but it's also an audiovisual assault. *1/2 (out of four).
","THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS / (2001) *1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:'The Fast and the Furious' is not a movie as much as it's an audiovisual assault. I suppose you can call it a motion picture because it consists of moving pictures flashing before a large screen, but movies are a form of the arts, which exist to please people. 'The Fast and the Furious' is not pleasing, involving, or entertaining. Some people might enjoy it because of all the car stunts, crashes, chases, and intense action sequences, but that's all this production has. 'The Fast and the Furious' should have a medical alert warning on its poster: 'This film is not for those faint of heart.' Not because of high octane suspense, but because it attacks our senses from all angles-to an unhealthy level. The booming, nauseating soundtrack demolishes our eardrums while our sight becomes desensitized by all the gratuitous violence and testosterone-laden fist fights. This isn't entertaining-it's violating.
This is the kind of movie that throws logic into the air to concentrate on stupefying the audience with unconvincing action. There's a scene where a cop speeds down the streets of LA in his car while firing a gun at an accelerating motorcycle. First, there would be more people on the streets of LA. Second, I do not think a cop would jeopardize the lives of so many innocent pedestrians by opening fire on a moving object.Actor Paul Walker reunites with his 'The Skulls' director Rob Cohen. (I will give Cohen credit for one thing: 'The Fast and the Furious' is a whole lot better than 'The Skulls,' but that's not saying much.) He stars as an LA cop named Brian, who's working undercover to investigate a frequent string of truck hijackings.The prime suspect is Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel from 'Pitch Black'), a buff, tough, and rough dude who spends his days working at a tune-up shop and his nights drag racing high speed cars. Brian decides to earn the respect of the racer. Toretto's excepts Brian as his right-handman. Brian also falls for an attractive young woman (Jordana Brewster). Here's a surprise: the girl is Dominic's sister. 'You break her heart, I'll break your neck,' explains Dom to the humbled Brian. I wouldn't second guess him.The one-dimensional, unsympathetic characters explain most of the plot to us, but their dual explanations feel like an intrusion to the copious action sequences. When they do speak, it's only in clichés. Don't worry, though. These scenes are few and far between. Most of the time the characters speak in actions, not words. Sometimes that can work to a movie's advantage, but not when the actions are violent impulses and obvious plot motivations.'The Fast and the Furious' occupies no surprises, no involving character relationships, and no memorable lines of dialogue. After the movie, I defy anyone in the audience to quote a single line of important dialogue. You probably couldn't either, because there are no important lines of dialogue in this movie. A few moments do induce some much appreciated suspense, but before we become too interested, the production abruptly cuts to the next scene.Naturally, 'The Fast and the Furious' contains some eye-popping, jaw-dropping car stunts. This movie is a surefire hit with fans of such movies as 'Gone in 60 Seconds' and 'Driven.' The action sequences are indeed intense and well accomplished, and I also admire the work by Vin Diesel. These positives make the negatives even more apparent. With the decent material present, it's a shame the movie as a whole is so utterly pointless.
'The Fast and the Furious' is yet another prime example of how movie producers hold back on the material to warrant a lower rating. In this case it's the PG-13. The rating greatly limits the violent and  sexual content, and the language the street gang uses is anything but realistic. Some movies are born to be R-rated, like 'The Fast and the Furious.' But gutless producers want their movie suitable for all audiences, thus the movie is more likely to prosper in the box office. I'm sure I speak for many when I say that I felt cheated out of a more edgy, provocative movie.
I like the title, though. 'The Fast and the Furious,' they got that right!",Null,2,4,12 July 2001
Pearl Harbor," This film does not have the inspiration or perseverance like other war movies. **1/2 (out of four)
","PEARL HARBOR / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)'Pearl Harbor' does not have the inspiration or perseverance like other war movies. It owes more to 'Titanic' than most war films, however. The film makes the mistake of incorporating the events of Dec. 7, 1941 into an obvious, familiar love triangle. That worked with 'Titanic' because its love story was convincing and passionate. 'Pearl Harbor' feels labored, strained, and we can predict every twist and turn a mile away.'Pearl Harbor' is yet another victim of commercialization. It's the kind of movie that tries so hard to please everyone, it feels contrived. The filmmaker's were under strict orders to keep the material PG-13; obviously the producer's thought an R-rating would keep its target audience away from the big screen. That has not been the case for other recent war movies like 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'The Thin Red Line,' or even 'Three Kings.' Granted, with its hot young cast and customary love story, this film clearly aims for an under 25 crowd. It is very depressing to see studios sacrificing their cinematic art for the MPAA's often ridiculous standards.The filmmaker's changed the movie so that it would not offend other areas of the world. Although the alterations were very minor, it is a disgrace that the studio actually dubbed dialogue to please certain audiences. This action shows how gutless these filmmakers are. They also submit to the usual audience pleasers-in the first ten minutes, the film already displays sappy emotions, failed attempts at humor, easy to swallow dialogue, and music that determines the mood of the scenes. There is even one of those mournful goodbye scenes at the end where one character pleads 'stay with me,' as the dying character states his final request to 'take good care of [name here].'The major subject of the film is an American love story centering on two childhood friends named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). They enter the Army Air Corps where Rafe falls in love with a nurse named Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe is called to duty in another country. Soon after he leaves, the reports print he is dead, leaving the scene to Danny. A few months pass and before we know it, Danny and Evelyn are under the covers. What happens next comes to the surprise of nobody in the audience- (SPOILER) -Rafe is alive and comes back to America with visions of Evelyn in his mind. He is furious that his old best friend has fallen for his girl. This conflict really should have spent more time on the emotional struggle Evelyn experiences-but instead leads to predictable bar fights and shouting matches. Then those pesky Japanese go and drop bombs on Pearl Harbor, interrupting this bamboozling love triangle.The historic aspects of this movie are also quite cloudy. There is no sense of history or strategy. Did Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18 month reserve? Would war restore their fuel reserve? At the end of the movie, where Jimmy Doolittle's Tokyo raiders crash-land in China, Japanese patrols attack them. Why are there Japanese in China? There is a brief explanation that the Sino-Japanese war was already underway. As a critic, however, I am all for filmmakers taking creative liberties with a historic account. The events in this film do not have to take place exactly how they really happened.The casting of Ben Affleck was a mistake. He is not an actor who can inject instant chemistry into his characters. The film does not give him enough time to develop any charisma, so the casting directors should have gone with a more versatile actor. Josh Hartnett is fit for his role, however. He does a good job with the limited material. Beckinsale, beautiful and lush, is also quite the treat. Hartnett and Beckinsale blossom from an involving chemistry, making Affleck's miscasting even more obvious. Unfortunately, neither male lead convincingly portrays his character with enough charm or affection for us to believe they are childhood best friends.I really liked the segments of the film where the Japanese conspired about the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film depicts them to be the smartest characters here; unfortunately, it also paints them as depressing, mournful individuals. They are people too. They can smile when they drop a bomb and hit a bull's-eye. 'Pearl Harbor' tires so desperately to make the Japanese look grim and evil, it never really gives them enough dimension. Equally as interesting is the American suspicions of the Japanese attack. But the movie does not focus on these interesting aspects, instead buries itself in an ignorance and pride.Most war movies are developed, vivid, and intuitive. 'Pearl Harbor' proves to be immature and childish. It certainly has a lot of fun with the attack, but that supplies us with yet another problem. Movies glorify almost everything they touch-many, many war movies can pride themselves in making war look graphic and disturbing; we want no part of it. While 'Pearl Harbor' doesn't make war look fun, and I do not think it glorifies war, this movie is not repulsive in its illusion of war. This movie focuses too much on developing a sense of commercial satisfaction. The film's centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, not a horrific account of the attack on 'Pearl Harbor.' This is more of an action movie, not an account of a major US military battle.'Pearl Harbor' is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, arousing incredible audience interest with a budget of over $150 million. A lot of people will go see this film; it will most certainly be one of the biggest hits of the year. This is a simple special effects extravaganza-made with the intentions of grossing millions and millions of dollars-which probably explains why there are so many things wrong with it.",6,0,1,6 June 2001
The Usual Suspects," Great Film that could have been Greater. **** out of ****
","'The Usual Suspects' is like a giant across movie landscape. Throughout film history no other thriller has so thoroughly captured an audience's attention and then massacres their predictions of something they never knew to begin with, then placing them into a state of wondering just what has happened here. I'll tell you what, I see over one hundred movies a year and this is one of the best, most imaginative and involving I have seen in my life.The movie begins on a gloomy night in the past, featuring a boat heist gone wrong as an injured man named Keaton lies on the cold hard cement. Then, slowly and quietly, a misty image appears. He walks up to Keaton and shots him twice with a gun in his hand. Now, the story beings, so read carefully.Six weeks ago: five men are arrested, they include Verbal, Hockney, Fenster, McManus, and Keaton. They meet in a hilarious police-lineup, and decide to plan emerald robbery. Keaton, at first unsure of himself turning back to the face of crime, but then later on chooses to be included after all. The heist is pulled of perfectly and leads to another where a drug dealer named Saul is killed, but the robber is successful.However, after the five men's success is at its top, a mysterious, tall man appears calling himself Kobayashi and explain to them that the notorious Keyser Sose demands that they do a boat heist docked in San Pedro Harbor, which turns out to be an extremely dangerous mission in which no one believes that all five will live, but those who do will inherit immense rewards. Fenster is resistant and is then found brutally killed on a beach. The rest then plan to kill Kobayashi and his men, but he again gives the upper hand on the four men and blackmails them into doing the robbery against their will. One survives.That man is Verbal, a cripple, who tells though a police questioning and flashbacks the story above, to a cop named Kujan. He explains who Keyser Sose is: At first we meet him as just a clam shadow smoking a cigarette as he kills a man helpless and confused. We then here about him in a legend, a man  who would rather murder his own family than has them live another day in sorrow. Later we see his towering power and reputation, a murdered man on a beach, an accused killer freed by high stakes agents, a boat filled with professional mercenaries found burned with nearly everyone killed. Then, alas, we see him for a last time, as a man who has been in front of our faces the whole time, and in the end, slips right though our fingers, never to be seen again.Keyser Sose is a brilliantly achieved villain, perhaps one of the most inspiring ever developed, but we never actual see his face, only in the end? So how can we care about someone whom we never see. No body has ever seen God, but everyone fears him.The dialogue is explicit, detailed and profane, wonderfully written and order. The characters are not your typical movie people, but realistic low lives, who break many rules of act breaks, antagonists protagonists and present day formula. This is a near flawless film.Near Flawless? Yes, there are a few unanswered questioned aboard 'The Usual Suspects.' For instance, Why don't we see Fenster being killed? Or why does Kujan let Verbal go after admitting to killing Saul? Or why don't we see Keaton's girlfriend being killed? So many important events are only talked about, never seen.Kevin Spacy needs to be nominated for best actor of the century and most certainly is on my list for the greatest performer in a leading role of all time.'The Usual Suspects' is a movie that I believe everyone, age appropriate, should experience. While sitting in my lazy boy screening this movie I felt something. Something that only people who are emotionally touched by movies feel. It is a feeling in which for two hours your life stops, and the experiencing of another begins. The chemistry between the viewer and the film itself here is indescribable.

","TIGERLAND / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	Throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ('8MM,' 'A Time to Kill'), easily one of the riskiest directors currently working, has found resemblance with 'The Thin Red Line' in the way his new drama 'Tigerland' steps in an individual soldier's shoes. This movie, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more guts and irony than 'The Thin Red Line' or even 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although the movie's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present, it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war. 	I would want to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are the men really this unabashed and brutal? I am sure some of them are, but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is rebellious against the ideas of war. His personality instantly counteracts with several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose flamed temper often exasperates Bozz's tension with the idea of going to war. The war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a Louisiana-based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training. This film is specifically about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff. 	 Shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget, Joel Schumacher accurately displays a gritty, perverse, cruel, and unmerciful atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blown-out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature. This unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie, quite graphic in its use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words pound the audience, some in shock of what they are hearing. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true, and emotional.	If anything, 'Tigerland' provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat. Such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war, knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken. Such thought-provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees. This movie is not for all audiences, but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army...and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such.",8,21,33,31 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," One of the most stirring and dazzling martial arts films ever made. ***1/2 (out of four)
","CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French: 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a stirring, sweeping, engaging, and action-packed epic achievement in filmmaking; it is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a long time. It demonstrates martial arts is not about fighting or daring stunts, but about personal achievement, honor, and dignity. The villains in this kind of story are almost always people who use their artful abilities for evil or selfish completion. The heroes are overcome by duty and achievement, and often defy limitation of physiology and mental solicitude. This movie confirms those ideas in such a method that we cannot take our eyes off the screen even for a second.	Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a massive giant over movie landscape of previous attempts to portray the art of martial arts in a meaningful voice. Jackie Chan is the most popular of today's martial artist actors, but I cannot figure out why. Jackie Chan's movies are stupid, contain thin and distant stories, and almost regularly fail to engage or provide anything but a few shallow laughs and dozens of action sequences. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is the perfect tool for me to express my resentment with Jackie Chan movies. 	'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' does contain such absurdities as seen in Jackie Chan productions; there are sequences where the characters defy the laws of gravity, glide over rooftops, rush up the sides of walls, and leap from one house to another. These scenes are so much more convincing than Jackie Chan aimlessly scampering down the sides of lofty structures, though. Why? Because what happens is in the spirit of the characters' convictions and possibilities. When Jackie Chan does these stunts, he does them simply because he can. There is no realization in mindless action, but there is in such sheer physical grace of the scenes in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'
	The fight sequences can also help determine the difference between this movie and 'The Legend of Drunken Master,' 'Shanghai Noon,' 'First Strike,' 'Mr. Nice Guy,' or any other recent Jackie Chan action frolic. Chan uses fast-paced fighting to provoke laugher of disbelief, but the scenes are not defined within the context of the plot and are always contrived and feel forced. Like the scenes in Jackie Chan films, long training hours went into preparation, and they are beautifully choreographed. But the unique content in that separates 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' from other films of this genre is the great depth and rhythm of how they connect with the story.Unlike Chan films, the script and character motives are not just clotheslines for senseless action, but are idyllic, ethereal and meaningful to advance the story. Chow Yun-Fat, who finally redeems himself after some extraordinary failures, co-stars with Michelle Yeoh, whom both are experienced martial artists. Yun Fat plays a warrior named Li Mu Bai who vowed to avenge the murder of his master done in by the evil Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei). This villain also stands between two characters' affectionate feelings for each other. She has arranged for the capture of a soulful sword one belonging to Li Mu Bai's master, and only Li Mu Bai can return it to its rightful owner. 	Screenwriters James Schamus, Wang Hui Ling and Tsai Kuo Jung amazingly capture the deep sentiment of the human love story, which is not the usual hokum, but touching and uplifting. Ang Lee allows for an unusual long but necessary flashback that is more of a separate story than a sequence. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh dazzle on screen as they master the delicate martial arts techniques. The fight sequences are so enticingly photographed, the sheer image of the characters battling on screen acquires unmatched escapism. Before watching 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' first examine the qualities of a Jackie Chan production, the overwhelming achievement of this film will be even more apparent. You may never look at martial arts films the same way again.",8,12,23,18 February 2001
Good Will Hunting," Inspirational and enjoyable style, but too much of the film is recycled. **1/2 (out of four)
","GOOD WILL HUNTING / (1997) **1/2 (out of four)The tremendous, puzzling critical and public praise 'Good Will Hunting' received utterly astounds me. What has America come to in order to get such great satisfaction out of a movie like this, jumping back and forth between presumptive concepts and a shameless plot; Gus Van Sant directs a script by Matt Damon and Ben Afflect, who think they are much better than they are. The two screenwriters actually took home the Oscar in 1997 for their work. But why? The movie certainly has an inspiring style, and if you do not try to hard you might find yourself having a good time watching it. But with more thought this script could have actually been worthy of the Awards it caught.The movie takes place at a Boston University where we meet an egotistical and youthful janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Nobody would ever guess beneath his tough and cocky attitude, urges to get nowhere in life, series of problems with the law, and rebellious actions that he is the smartest individual in Boston, if not the planet Earth. It feels so customary, the most unexpected person in the university is the smartest. Most of us will not find ourselves surprised when we learn this character has a deeply troubled past.Will Hunting beats the crap out of a police officer and finds himself with a demanding prison sentence. This is where the movie puts a new spin on an old cliché: instead of a father pushing a rebellious offspring to live the life he wants him to live, here we have a college professor and a young janitor going at the notion. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) realizes this young man has an extremely complex ability to solve mathematical problems and offers Will an alternative to jail time. He gets the reluctant juvenile a kind psychiatrist named Sean (Robin Williams). The filmmakers use this character to inject a bunch of other irritating dramatic contrivances in the story, dealing with previous child abuse, professional competitiveness, alcoholism, social class conflicts, jealousy, remorse, and guilt, but Damon and Affleck use these as predictable and formulaic tools to grab our emotions. They come off as amateurish and intractable.
Will is emerged in self-discovery when his relationship with Sean stabilizes. He also meets a nice, charming young girl (Minnie Driver), who provides the plot with some romantic tensions. Her character's presence is needed so we can actually witness the impact of his counseling. But Will's moral awakenings are hammered in our heads. It's like the filmmakers did not think we could figure things out on our own so they felt the need to spell things out. This is absurd; most audiences can perfectly see the intentions and emotional turmoil Will is going through. This movie insults our intelligence.The plot and theme of this movie hinge too much upon the idea that it is difficult for an intelligent person to move from low-class to a honorable member of society. This is why the contrivances are so obvious. Even after some of the thoughtless writing, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make the amazingly egotistical choice of starring in the film themselves. Both are talented actors, and Affleck does no harm here; his character does not make much of an impact. It is Matt Damon who is one of the biggest examples of miscasting in recent movie history.  Damon does not look like a tenement citizen regardless of how hard he tries. His performance is riddled with indolent character traits, like smoking and the frequent use of profanity.
Damon's character is also spectacularly aggravating. He originates no sympathy because Will is such a selfish idiot. Why should we root for him to succeed if he does not want success himself? Granted the character has a traumatic past and troubled emotions, but none of those things are executed in a convincing method, therefore it is up to Damon to fill the character with inspiration and livability, but I hated, hated, hated Will. I wanted Robin Williams to put a fist in his mouth. Is this what the filmmakers wanted, for us to despise the main character?Damon makes the performances by Stellan Skarsgard and Robin Williams standout. Robin Williams inhabits the only sensible character here; I felt so good when he kicked Will out of his office. No wonder he won best supporting actor at the Academy Awards, he is terrific. The performance captures his character's emotional and comical perspectives. Sean is also supplied with an absorbing circle of being, depth and dimension. Damon's character also perspires of such material, but Will seems to be altered for the script's needs. One scene he is ambitious and defends his friends, other times he is arrogant and cocky, yet sometimes gentle and charismatic. Minnie Driver is also charming, but her character also feels somewhat controlled. She is a plot puppet, but at least she portrays the character with personality and zest.Most of the movie has an enlightening and pleasant style, and if you are not too critical this movie does achieve its own goals. With so many problems with its plot, characters, and borrowed material, it's startling that 'Good Will Hunting' feels uncluttered, organized, and so entertaining and human at times. But even the good substances contribute to a plate that may be a just bit too full for prosperity.",6,3,6,28 February 2001
Moulin Rouge!," One of the few movies out there worth watching several times, just because of the sheer visual and musical enchantment. **** (out of four)
","MOULIN ROUGE! / (2001) **** (out of four)By Blake French:	'Moulin Rouge!' revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant, expensive Broadway production on screen, with enough open courage, engrossing passion, and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films; 'Moulin Rouge!' may be a cliché-ridden love triangle, but Baz Luhrmann, the film's director, shines a fresh, stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid, exuberant style for his characters-a mixture between a fast-paced music video and lush, exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs, he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy, but it is the perfect approach to the material. 	From the opening moments, 'Moulin Rouge!' plays full force, overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom, and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this, we cut to 'The Sound of Music,' where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure, and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching 'Moulin Rouge!' is in the visual stimulation; the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience.
	Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time, celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. 'Moulin Rouge' may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy, intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again, even, to my great reluctance, John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century, as Christian (McGregor) enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him, including the French artist Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident, Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club, ran by the robust Harold Zinder (Jim Broadbent). It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular, sexy lead performer and courtesan, Satine (Kidman), to work in their production.
	After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), Satine falls in love with Christian, much to the dismay of many. However, she believes herself to be a simple prostitute, who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue, but only under his circumstances, things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support. Obviously, the best thing in 'Moulin Rouge!' is the music. Apart from the cast, the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe, Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, Fatboy Slim, Beck, and many others. The kind of music that plays here does not account for a period epic at all, however. 'Moulin Rouge!' doesn't try to be a historic depiction, but instead an expression of fantasy and passion. The elegant sets, eventful style, and powerful choreography scream modern day, post-pop-culture. I ran out to purchase the motion picture soundtrack. You should, too. But listening to the soundtrack on your CD player at home is nothing like experiencing the memorable singing and dancing, sexual energy, and relentless enthusiasm on the big screen.
As I say in very few film critiques, some movies are you watch, others you experience. 'Moulin Rouge' is an experience not to be missed. It is a bizarre, unique blend of exhaustive energy and lively action-one of the bravest, most ambitious and entertaining movies of the year.",10,244,363,16 June 2001
Rules of Engagement," Filled with flaws, but still engaging due to strong performances. *** out of ****.
","RULES OF ENGAGEMENT / (2000) ***Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Kingsley, Blair Underwood, Guy Pearce, Bruce Greenwood, Anne Archer, and Philip Baker Hall.Directed by William Friedkin. Written by James Webb. Running time: 123 minutes. Rated R (for graphic violence and language).By Blake French: 	'Rules of Engagement' is a thriller of missed opportunities and noticeable failures. The film squeezes out of explanation and conclusive execution; it is riddled with unmistakable flaws are structural miscalculations. I found myself deeply engaged within the profoundness of the somewhat familiar story, however, even after these problems. This drama, directed by William Friedkin, is intense and strongly constructed, proving what accurate conditions the filmmakers accommodate. 	The movie opens fifty years ago during a battle in Vietnam. We meet two main characters, Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones). The two become good friends after Childers saves the life of Hodges during a brutal siege. Later, Childers is questioned due to a questionably inhuman, although effective, circumstance he embraces to achieve his quickly constructed strategy.
	We skip ahead to the retirement of Hodges as a mostly unsuccessful military lawyer. Childers has accepted command of a Marine unit that finds itself at duty in Yemen after an American embassy becomes distressed. The US sends Childers and his forces to the country to recall the Ambassador (Ben Kingsley), his wife, Mrs. Mourain (Anne Archer), and their son, as well as to take charge of the rioting Yemenis. 	Once at the embassy, the rioting crowd becomes too hostile. After a sniper kills one of his men, Childers commands his crew to open fire on the civilians. The Yemeni casualties number well over seventy-five. National Security Adviser William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) placed charges on Childers because he does not think the U.S. should take blame for what he considers the actions of a one individual. The objection is transgressing the rules of engagement. Other key characters in the film are the highly proclaimed General H. Lawrence Hodges (Philip Baker Hall), military prosecutors Major Biggs (Guy Pearce), and Capt. Tom Chandler (Mark Feuerstein), and Ambassador Mourain.The setup, written by James Webb, takes too long to set up. Although well-depicted and clear, the rest of the movie hinges entirely on it. It may have been more effective if the audience did not know what happened in Yemen. There is also a possibility that it could have been more revealing and tense if the film had spent more time in researching its issues. 
	Another conflict in the setup is the fact that we are unaware of important details. Why are the Yemenis rioting? Obviously their reasoning has something to do with the US Ambassador. Such a critical plot point, one in which the rest of the story hinges upon, is never revealed.
	The riot and war scenes feature swift and realistically sketchy camera positions and movements. Similar to 'Saving Private Ryan,' this production attempts to make little sense of the seemingly senseless violence. This quality composes 'Rules of Engagement' in a relatively believable and intense style.   William Friedkin takes 'Rules of Engagement' seriously, squeezing little dramatic relief within the film's context. Although focused direction is normally a very effective quality, Friedkin suffers from being too converged. The characters are giving few incidences in which they are able to portray any life apart from their occupations. The filmmakers give the characters a lot of smart and juicy dialogue to gnaw on, generating engaging depth in them. As such, these characters are not one dimensional, just one directional.   	The courtroom scenes are some of the film's most powerful and truthful. Solid performances by Guy Pearce, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, and Ben Kingsley make for a rigid-atmosphere behind legal doors. For the first time in a long while I was unsure of what the jury's final decision would be. Maybe that is because we are unsure about our stance on the situations. Some of the actions, such as elements of perjury and withholding evidence, could be more explained. Overall, however, the notions were quite clear.
Perhaps the biggest success in 'Rules of Engagement' is its strong narrative theme of action. The movie follows a steady through-line. Although excessively concentrated, each scene advances the story and complicates the initial problem. Despite flaws in numerous areas and a somewhat mixed review, 'Rules of Engagement' is a solid, stark movie marginally worthy of recognition. 'Rules of Engagement' is brought to you by Paramount Pictures.",7,8,22,15 April 2000

The Nightmare Before Christmas," One of the most memorable holiday classics of all time. A visual masterpiece. ***1/2 out of ****.
","THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS / (1993) ***1/2Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, Ed Ivory, and William Hickey Directed by Henry Celiac. Written by Michael McDowell. Running time: 76 minutes. Rated PG (for horrific images and some animated violence).	Tim Burton seems like the only being on the planet who could come with characters such as the ones found in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' The feature is literally a tale likely to be found in a child's dreams. It creates a world of its own, inhabiting unforgettable characters and events that should be shared with generations. This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.
	The atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween. This character has grown depressed and saddened by the routine living style he inhabits. We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town: a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety. Jack is mystified by the glamorous atmosphere, and rushes home to tell the Town of Halloween about his adventures.	We realize the internalconflict is Jack's boredom of routine. This becomes more complex when he tries to figure out the meaning of Christmas. The external problem comes later in the plot, where we predict an uneasy disaster upcoming due to his intentions of recreating Christmas in Halloween style.Other key characters are Sally, the puppet-like creation of an angry professor, the city's Mayor who has a head for both his good and bad personality, the Oggie Boogie, the film's villain who is everything we ever dreamed of regarding a diabolical animated bad guy, and the inevitable character of Santa Clause.'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is not necessarily a children's movie, it might be too strange or fanatical for the very young. It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is titled wonderfully, although the film is truly not a nightmare, but a dream--a dream brought to life on the big screen.

Mission: Impossible II," Involving and exciting, very different from the original film. *** out of ****.
","MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 / (2000) ***'Mission: Impossible 2' has as much in common with the original movie as hot has with cold. Beyond some of the starring roles, the two productions are as different as day and night. Brian DePalma directed 'Mission: Impossible,' a puzzling, disjointed action picture leaving little to no hope for a sequel. However, the action-orientated John Woo has taken the position in place of DePalma and captures the excitement, venture, and stylish sequences with more dexterity and structure. 'Mission: Impossible 2' is relative, involving, and swank. The film takes all too familiar 'James Bond' components and creates a movie more similar to the licensed to kill spy than the primary contents of the television series.Tom Cruise once again stars as proselyte I.M.F. agent Ethan Hunt, recently assigned to track down a former representative who possesses a deadly biochemical substance obtained by the murdered scientist Dr. Vladimir Nekhorick (Rade Sherbedgia). The villain, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), once had an attractive girlfriend named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), whose occupation as a professional thief makes Ethan dissatisfied when he must recruit her as a member of a mission team.After sleeping and falling in love with her, Ethan oppose the idea of sending Nyah back to Ambrose's luxurious resort to recover information of his criminal intentions. Equipped with a traceable implant, this young woman, Ethan, and his two accomplices Luther (Ving Rhymes), and Billy (John Polson), seek to discover and foil the plans of Ambrose and his accomplices.The story is clear, involving, and comprehendible; it is not so complex the audience becomes lost and attentions wander. The plot contains enough tension, high stakes, twists, and intriguing characters to keep us on edge.'Mission: Impossible 2' is not all story, however, much of the production has a condescending commercial appearance. The sophisticated actors, rock and roll music, intense action sequences, high tech car chase scenes, stylish camera angles, and audience pleasing one liners are more self gratifying rather than entertaining. I can almost see the producers now, discussing what battles scenes and explosions to deposit within the film's theatrical trailer; the filmmakers also need to know that external action itself does not make for a thought-provoking movie.The production succeeds mainly due to an effective, solidly portrayed villain, keenly acted by Dougray Scott ('Ever After: A Cinderella Story'). He conquers his role with a sense of sly, fiendish wit and knowledge. Tom Cruise again proves he is more than capable of dramatizing Ethan Hunt with style and enticing persuasion. Supporting roles by Thandie Newton, Ving Rhames, Brendan Gleeson, and Anthony Hopkins are also impressive.'Mission: Impossible 2' accomplishes that exceptional task of actually being better than its preceding original. The success of this picture is surely due to the direction by John Woo ('Face/Off'), who is one of the better action directors currently in work. His formulaic attitude presents itself in the end, however, as the movie turns from sharp and sneaky to running on sheer adrenaline through the final half hour. It really irritates me when the third act of a movie consists of loud gun shoot-outs, risky stunts, and physical combat in which men dressed in black suits fire seemingly endless rounds at the protagonist only to miss, yet he pulls out a small caliber pistol and shoots every one of them dead. 'Mission: Impossible 2' may work as an action picture, but it is not at the level of resisting the temptations to throw intellect into the wind and conclude itself in auto pilot mode.",7,14,29,9 June 2000
A Bug's Life," Much, much better than the irrelevant 'Antz.' *** out of *****
","'A Bug's Life' is a colorful tale that suffers from the same syndrome as 'Antz' does at first, but with its amusing and childish characters, along with a firm, clear plot, it manages to somehow dig itself out of a rather troublesome hole and entertain the audience to satisfaction.My first urge to talk to you about in my review of 'A Bug's Life' is obviously to compare this film with its successful competitor, 'Antz.' Both movies are about the lives of ants. Only one actually works. 'Antz,' that I gave **1/2 to, was dark, both in color and in plot. The visuals weren't satisfying and the characters weren't fun. They were sick, unhappy, average ants, and personally, you going have to do better than that to please me.'A Bug's Life' is full of color, happiness and childish fun. The main character wasn't based on a person like Woody Allen, he is a creative inventor, who devises all kinds of interesting gadgets and gismos. He is also a klutz on the side, which is what the amusing story evolves from.The visual effects, led by director John Lasseter,  are lush, rich images. The bugs are extremely well detailed. A rain looks like the colony is being water-bombed. The soundtrack is catchy and tuneful. The colors are mind-blowingly realistic.At the end of the movie, the bugs act as if they are the one who made this movie. They show us mistakes that they made during the film, like Jackie Chan films. We experience dialog mistakes, clumsiness of the characters and many more clever and funny sequences. I believe that people are calling this 'Bug Bloopers.' A Bug's Life' would never be as good as 'Toy Story' in its wildest dreams, but I sill think it is worth your time.",Null,0,1,29 December 1998
For Love of the Game," The individual scenes are better than the movie as a whole. ** out of ****
","FOR LOVE OF THE GAME (1999) **Starring: Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly, Jena Malone, and Brian Cox Director: Sam Raimi   ??? minutes   Rated PG-13 (for language and sensuality)By Blake French:	Sam Raimi has proven to us that he is a very capable director with movies like 'A Simple Plan.' The same goes for Kevin Costner, who has acted beautifully in movies like 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' and 'Field of Dreams.' Also, Kelly Preston ('Jack Frost'), John C. Reilly (Never Been Kissed') , and Jena Malone ('Stepmom') are all fine actors on the rise. Not to mention, this production is one of the most anticipated of the early fall movie season. With all  this going for it, 'For Love of the Game' should have been one heck of a drama...but, unfortunately, it's not. And it is a real disappointment considering the potential involved with the production.
	'For Love of the Game' reunites the popular romantic star Kevin Costner with the Baseball genre that affected audiences so immensely in the 1989 wonder 'Field of Dreams.' This movie may  have struck big with audiences as well, if only, it  had more Baseball in it. The film has one main game of Baseball included in its story, and oh, what a wonderful game it is. The tension arises with Costner being the soon-to-retire, forty year old pitcher named Billy Chapel, who is right in the middle of throwing a perfect game for the team of Detroit at what might just the end of his career.
	Also accruing: Chapel's long time girlfriend, Jane Aubrey, and her daughter, Heather, are leaving him to go to London for reasons entirely prepared by the writers in order to create an internal problem as well as Chapel's presumed retirement serving as an external problem. Pretty standard structure so far--if the filmmakers were  to continue with this almost perfect beginning this movie would have lived up  to its possibilities.
	But no. Right in the middle of the intriguing Ball game Billy is pitching for, his wondering mind propels a series of flashbacks that literally kill the production's hope of existing even as a half price video rental. It does three things that screw up the movie's overall point of view:1)  Billy's flashbacks tell of the love story between him and Jane--a subject that happened over five years ago. Shouldn't that be before the ball game taking place in present day? If you're going to develop a relationship between two characters, it should transpire in a logical, easy to understand order of events. Costner got this correct when he starred in this year's much better romantic journey 'Message in a Bottle,' but that film had little romantic chemistry. Here, he seems to be a puppet of the plot, but he and Kelly Preston are bursting at the seems with likable chemistry.2)  The flashbacks are somewhat irrelevant and disturb the intense tension that the Ball game contains; I was begging that Costner would focus long enough on  present day to allow us to become involved in what is interesting--no luck here.3)  The scenes add too many complications like:A)  Jane's runaway daughter who leaves her overly-protective mother after they have a big fight (which we never see, thus no empathy can relate). She runs off to her fathers, a junkie who is said to be stoned ninety percent of the time (whom we never meet, thus no reason to compare or take sides with the characters). These events are prepared for us by the prop department who obey the writers' commands. In this case, the filmmakers need a reason for Jane and Billy to see each other again. Instead of developing romantic chemistry by adding confrontations with Jane and Billy, they give us irrelevant coincidences. B)  During most of the flashbacks, Jane and Billy are not being developed, but fighting, arguing and destroying their relationship like a married couple. The sub-plots involved  with these flashbacks should develop their relationship, not mutilate it. C)  There is a major accident involving Billy and his hand. This incident is also prepared by the props department due to a need to trigger an effect that will have dastardly effects on Billy and Jane's relationship.
	Most of the film has chemistry and reason to its happenings and events. They just don't happen  in the right order to make the film fit together like an actual story offbeat love story. The beginning and the end are great--but  the middle is a disaster. Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston do what they can to keep the script in active motion, but even they are no match for poor screenwriting. It even goes for a desperate bookend sequence (if you don't know what a 'bookend' is, E-mail me) that is supposed to trend the scenes together, but that is way off whack. The closing scene is of the best I've seen all year; the sneak preview audience that I attended with was cheering happily for the characters. I was thinking to myself that this is a movie is too ridiculous to recognize the emotional power of its closing--and that its conclusion belongs in a better production.

The Insider," One of the year's best, most involving movies. Superior dialogue and terrific performances. **** (out of four).
","THE INSIDER / (1999) **** (out of'The Insider' prospers in almost every way, shape, and form possible. The production is a masterpiece of visual style, moving performances, and penetrating dialogue. The story is captivating, even at 157 minutes. There is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention throughout-and at a consistent pace. Many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue, but not 'The Insider.' This movie is one long intriguing moment, a moment that is never boring or lacking. It is also believable and entirely convincing. There is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information. It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time, always at the perfect second.Russell Crowe's character is the heart of the film, one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, an ex-employee at Brown & Williamson, one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers. Its chairman (Michael Gambon) has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routines-but not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls. When the company even further jeopardizes his existence, he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of B&W.He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program '60 Minutes,' receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company. Bergman contacts Wigand, aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential '60 Minutes' show. Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand, therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at B&W so concerned.The film makes many unexpected turns; in the second half, it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman. After losing his privacy, secrets, reputation, and family, Wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry. But Bergman faces further complications. His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.'You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own f*****g confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets,' explains Bergman.The dialogue is one of the brightest, most thought-provoking material in the film. All of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured, the stuttering, the spontaneous explicit declaratives, and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character's personalities (Agent: Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Wigand: Yes. Yes, I do. I get extremely emotional when *******s put bullets in my mailbox!).The movie's dramatic premise is so clear, so precise, so uncommonly absorbing. It expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters. There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman, giving them depth and human dimension. Despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree, I extensively enjoyed the piercing middle-eastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones.Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star Russell Crowe, but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance. Crowe is worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor; he delivers a performance of great subbtlness, but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power. He captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character, making his scenes involving, subversive, and taut.Michael Mann is the film's director, who also directed the 1995 thriller 'Heat' starring Val Kilmer, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Here, he pays close attention to details; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone, the camera captures the feeling-also hitting golf ball against a backdrop, dropping glasses on a table, and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions. Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography, taking the view of the character, and close up shots.'The Insider' inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television, reputation, honesty, and so forth. The biggest ethic I think Mann is trying to get across is of modern morality: always do the right thing, follow you conscience, no matter what the cost. Then there's the film's most provoking issue: 'Fame has a fifteen-minute half-life. Infamy lasts a little longer.'",9,58,72,21 March 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," Incredible performances and an enormously involving narrative. ***1/2 (out of four)
","GIRL, INTERRUPTED / (1999) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:'Have you ever confused a dream with life? Or stolen something when you have the cash? Have you ever been blue? Or thought your train moving while sitting still? Maybe I was just crazy. Maybe it was the 60's. Or maybe I was just a girl... interrupted.'Those are some of the most memorable lines from James Mangold's honest, heartfelt drama 'Girl Interrupted.' The speaker is Susanna Kaysen, played by Winona Ryder. The film is based on the memoir of Kaysen herself, re-encountering the experiences she actually spent in a mental institution after an attempted suicide. The book of the same name was published in 1993; it spent time on almost every best-seller list, including 11 weeks on the New York Times. It was in the 1980's when Kaysen began to revisit the most formative time in her life-20 years after the actual hospitalization. Memories of a nearly two-year stay at McLean Psychiatric Hospital, a private and exclusive institution near Cambridge, resurfaced while constructing her second book. She began writing vignettes of her experiences in the hospital, writing short stories about a time in her life she had not discussed for two decades.'The only thing that ever made me less loony was writing,' remembers Cambridge, Massachusetts-based writer Susanna Kaysen, author of her memoir, 'Girl, Interrupted.' Set in the turbulent 60's, the film details the young Kaysen, who finds herself at a mental institution for disturbed young women. Susanna makes friends, including a seductive and dangerous regular named Lisa (Angelina Jolie). I have never read this book, but after watching 'Girl, Interrupted' I am seriously considering it. The film is a powerful exploration into a depressing, bleak situation. When this movie was released theatrically in late 1999, I wondered how many people would want to see something about a young writer who tries to kill herself and then spends time in a nut-house. However, I was wrong to presume anything. 'Girl, Interrupted' contains a vivid, convincing world for its characters, but never do we feel awkward while watching this film, but involved and concerned. Screen-adapters James Mangold, Lisa Loomer, and Anna Hamilton Phelan construct a central character that is both consistent and empathetic. As the movie opens, we never see Kaysen's suicide attempt-there is no need to show it. This is a film about the results, not the action. We gradually learn about Kaysen as the movie progresses, thus the lack of initial character development. Even with little introductory material to establish her character, Winona Ryder creates a soothing, intriguing sole for Kaysen. The audience cares about Susanna before we even understand why she was sent to the mental institution.The film's supporting cast, including Jared Leto, Clea Duvall, Elizabeth Moss, Jeffrey Tambor, Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave, and Angelina Jolie, who won an Academy Award for her performance, actually develops the mood of the film-an essential aspect of its overall impact. James Mangold ('Copland') has a ambiguous style here, but it works extraordinarily well in this film. 'Girl, Interrupted' should do wonders for Susanna Kaysen's book; after watching the film, it is hard not to want to read the memoir.",9,47,59,22 June 2001
The Mummy Returns," One of the year' worst movies, another mindless special effects extravaganza. * (out of four)
","THE MUMMY RETURNS / (2001) * (out of four)By Blake French:	I can tell you exactly what happened with 'The Mummy Returns.' The filmmakers of 'The Mummy' were in stitches of the huge success of the first film and quickly had the original actors sign for a sequel. They got the green light based on the box-office grossing of the first film, and probably started shooting before the first draft of the script was complete. The results of this shallow, mind-numbing array of visual effects are ridiculous, frenetic, and spontaneous-one of the year's worst films. It proves when a movie is made with the intentions of grossing a lot of money, it does not provide audiences with much more than visual stimulation.'The Mummy' was one of the biggest box office hits in 1999, but even that was no cinematic masterpiece. Considering the rule of thumb that the original film is always better than its sequel, my expectations for 'The Mummy Returns' were not especially high. I expected the same kind of movie, where the plot is simply a clothesline for lots and lots of special effects and high-tech action sequences. I was right on the money, but I never expected the movie to be this horrible. 	 The plot in the original mummy' was kind of interesting-but in 'The Mummy Returns,' the filmmaker's do not really supply us with a plot-but with a string of incidences that setup for yet another pestering sequel. 'The Mummy Returns' opens with professional wrestler The Rock playing the Scorpion King, a warrior who trades his soul to a god in exchange for military victory, but becomes frozen in time. Most of the original film's actors reprise their roles; Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and John Hannah as protagonists and Arnold Vosloo as the antagonist. Director and writer Stephen Sommers also returns, with a script created for the sole purpose of making a sequel. 	I will not waste my time with a detailed plot synopsis. The film is much too incompetent for such an explanation. Besides, does the story really matter? If you chose to see this film, it will not be because of a thought-provoking story, or even an interest in the actors, but because it is a big-budget, special effects extravaganza. Many people will see this film-my guess is that they will walk away loving the action and visual effects, but once out of the theater this movie may never account in their minds again. It is forgettable, disposable, recycled junk-and you do not even have to think. Before you see this movie, park your brain outside the theater, you will not be needing it. 	What about the action sequences and special effects? Even that aspect of 'The Mummy Returns' fails miserably. The action scenes are predictable, superficial, and relentless. Action scenes relieve suspense. In this film, they occupy the tension-free plot. The film never builds for any suspense or momentum. This would not be a major problem if 'The Mummy Returns' had other redeeming factors-but the whole thing is one extended action sequence. The insignificant exhilaration never stops to take a breath. Watching this movie is just like watching 'The Mummy' again, but this time we expect every occurrence and see every turn coming from a mile away. The 'Indiana Jones' similarities become even more obvious. The film also introduces several new horror creatures, including a Scorpion monster so badly created that many audience members laughed at its sheer presence.",2,1,7,4 June 2001
Toy Story 2," Entertains adults just as much as it will children. One of the years best films. ***1/2 out of ****
","TOY STORY 2 (1999) ***1/2With the voices of: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kelsey Grammer, Joan Cusack, Jim Varney, & Wayne Knight Director: John Lasseter   Running time: 85 minutes   Rated GBy Blake French: 	In an era where audiences are given such few family movies, and in a time where such films are seldom given decent scripts, 'Toy Story 2' is a jolt of lightening in the fast fading genre of unobjectionable entertainment. Over the past several years we've received filmmaker's poor attempts at granting us enjoyment with an orphaned raised by jungle apes, bouncy green slime, a massive gorilla reeking havoc on a major city, a child fending off robbers by himself near Christmas, a small boy's attempts to rescue a battered dog from his cruel owner, a canine playing football, a colony of ants in trouble, a talking mouse, and even a film version of an old cartoon about a man filtered with countless gizmos. None of those desperate family tales work. I think you can understand through these examples that when a great children's film does finally open, and entertains adults equally as much as it mesmerizes its target audience I give it the honor of being one of the years best movies. 	'Toy Story 2' continues the traditional lives of the characters brought to our attention in the original movie released in 1995. What makes 'Toy Story' unique is the fact that the characters are mostly toys. The familiar faces include everyone's favorite cowboy Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Hamm the piggy bank, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the cowardly Tyrannosaurs Rex, the Army Sergeant, Little Bo Peep, and the Slinky Dog. The sequel film introduces several new characters in its presence consisting of Prospector Pete, Jessie the Cowgirl, and antagonists, a  greedy human named Big Al and robotic video game figure called Zurg. The plot has to do with several of the toys rescue attempts to save Woody from a money hungry thief who intends to sell him to a different country.Just a few days ago I screened the somewhat similar, although unsuccessful, family comedy 'Stuart Little.' That movie failed because it attempted to blend our human world with the likes of pure fictional fantasy; a talking mouse that acts like a human. It is hard to except something like that without an explanation--giving the filmmakers no choice but to get into a complicated, logical explanation that would bore the majority of an audience. 'Toy Story 2' needs none of that explication. It contains its illusion outside of our world, creating a tale that inspires our imagination. The filmmakers do not try to compare the likes of toys being alive with reality. It creates its own atmosphere which seems unfamiliar and magical. It is a place that lives within our dreams; everyone has hoped for their toys to come alive at one time or another. 'Toy Story 2' brings this world to life to the quality of the original 'Toy Story.' This movie is a landmark in the gender of animated family comedies that should be treasured for all that its worth. Brought to you by Walt Disney Pictures.",9,48,60,11 January 2000

It kept your fascination throughout the whole movie.  It had comedy, drama, and music by professional musicians.  Woody and Buzz Light-year  (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen) are both excellent together, as in the original Toy Story.  People wanted a great movie and what people want people receive.	They only thing keeping this movie from 4* was it had 3 different plots going on at once.

Life Is Beautiful," What starts out to be a zany slapstick comedy turns out to be one of the years best. ***1/2 out of ****
","'Life is Beautiful' starts out awful. It has no idea about what it wants to be, which is somewhere between a screwball comedy and an emotional tearjerker. There are more emotions being shuffled up in its script as there are minutes in the movie. The story is also very hard to follow. So how can a movie like this work?The comedy part of this film details a hotel waiter in Italy in the 1930s, Guido, played by Benign, who also directed and co-wrote the movie.  This man is a clown in some ways, and he creates most of the film's funny slapstick humor. A few examples of this include Guido arriving in town in a runaway car with failed brakes, his love at first sight with a woman named Dora, the many different directions one hat can lead to, and how he is mistaken for a school inspector giving a speech about his wonderful body.After he and Dora eventually get married and have a son, who is five years old the first time we meet him, we learn that he is Jewish. In 1945, all of the Jews in the town are sent to a prison camp by the Fascists. Doha makes the decision come along to be with her family.However, Guido makes up a story about a game that all of this is to his son to prevent him from learning the horror of the truth. The game is where everyone competes to be the fastest to earn 1000 points, then the prize is a real life tank.It's at this point where the film takes off, and makes the audience feel sorry for the characters. And the story is as breathtaking as it is realistic. The film softens the holocaust to put in this humor, however. In real life I'm not sure that the couple would have lasted a week.The performances were overlooked by me until the film's third act, where the father learns to keep his cool under all of this stress. Roberto Benigni is superb, as he is directing this movie. His comic touch seems out of place, but never do I have any complaints about it.Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini, Gastonia Durano and  Horst Buchholz, whom I have never heard of, all are at their very best,  as the side characters. There are many, and sometimes they are a bit distracting. But in the end I am only praising the film for its choice of characters.'Life is Beautiful' is visually stunning as well. The scenery and mountains are beautifully precious. I think this movie might be up for a nomination of best cinematography of the year. Without it, I think the audience may have been board between the characters talking and the humor layout.This movie, in the end, does nothing less then remind us that life truly is beautiful, and we should never question imagination or our gut feeling about something. This is easily one of the best foreign language film's of the year. If it wasn't for the disastrous first half this movie may have made it to my 'Top Ten of 1998' list. Still, we have a treasureous movie here that clearly works in what I call the 'Think and Forget' method. Great job, Roberto Benigni.",8,1,4,12 July 1999
The Hurricane," Denzel Washington is superior, a film with a strongly constructed message. ***1/2 out of ****.
","THE HURRICANE (1999) ***1/2Starring: Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Deborah Unger, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya, Debbi Morgan, Clancy Brown, David Paymer, and Rod Steiger Directed by Norman Jewison. Written by Sam Chaiton. Based on the novel 'The 16th Round,' by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. Running Time: 155 minutes. Rated R (for language and some violence).By Blake French:(The following review of 'The Hurricane' contains a description plot description that may or may not be of a spoiling nature.)	The most amazing property of Norman Jewison's 'The Hurricane' is that it would have been equivalently as powerful, equally as touching, and just as thought-provoking if there never lived a man named Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter. The movie is such a relevant, understandable feature, it has abundant emotional impact on the majority of an appreciative audience regardless if they realize it is based on an actual individual or not. This is one of the best movies of the year. In accordance with its many strong areas it succeeds in, the picture should present itself well when Academy Award time comes around. 	'The Hurricane' tells the true story of famous African American middleweight boxing champion named Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. The time period is the late 1960's. Rubin spent more of his childhood being incarcerated in one way or another. The past is behind him, however, and Carter has miraculously turned his life around and raised a happy family consisting of a wife and young boy. 	A corrupt police force wrongly accuses 'The Hurricane' and his friend of murdering several innocent pedestrians when coming home from a party one evening. Det. Vincent Della Pesca, a cruel, racist law enforcer who has been after Rubin since he was a child, demands that Carter and his pal be named the killers. A half dead victim, full of hate towards his shooters, identifies Carter and his acquaintance as the terrorists. After a trail based on stacked lies, Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter and his buddy are convicted and sentenced to three life sentences in a state prison.
	While serving his term, Rubin puts the prison warden a fight it isn't ready for. Carter refuses to wear clothing that other convicts ware; he does not allow himself to be at the same level as others who have committed horrendous crimes. 'I've committed no crime, a crime has been committed against me,' states Carter in a powerful confrontation sequence. He makes several attempts for acquittal while serving his time--all are eventually denied. Carter eventually loses hope, orders his wife to divorce him, and becomes a strong, hardened prisoner, focusing only serving his time..	For years, Carter's innocent life is wasted away while concealed behind concrete walls. Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter decides to write a book about his life experiences. In the book, Carter explains to his readers about the injustice that was served to him, the police corruption with so much malignity towards his race, his life as a child going up in a racist time, and his practice as a professional boxer. That publication, titled 'The 16th Round,' becomes a bestseller. However, as time passes, it becomes over looked, and forgotten. 	This is where the movie's decisive script introduces several new, important characters. Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon), an African American teenager living with his Canadian foster parents, Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber), Terry Swinton (John Hannah), and Lisa Peters (Deborah Unger). One day, Lesra randomly picks up a book and it just so happens to be 'The 16th Round.' After reading it, and being emotionally touched, he begins to plead with his foster parents to help Carter fight for his redemption.
	It is unusual and risky for a film to open a new series of events so far into the plot. However, 'The Hurricane' contains character development among the year's best. Most of the production is spent explaining Rubin Carter to us in one way or another, which is why, as the story progresses, we care more and more about him. His development is not necessarily in a certain order, which is understandable here. The structure within the characters presents itself in a non-conventional approach. To my surprise, the narrative point of view, although about a specific character, is more omniscient than a first person like you'd expect. 	Denzel Washington recently won a well-deserved Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Rubin Carter. He performs his character with a strong emotional foundation and realistic, vivid details. These qualities are what makes the character so empathetic. Also contributing fine performances are Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Deborah Unger and Vicellous Reon Shannon, all with solid supporting roles. 	Many of the scenes in 'The Hurricane' come off as a little on the gentle side. Obviously the filmmakers believe in the theory about catching more flies with honey than sugar. Though the film still packs a powerful message, with such material, director Norman Jewison should have taken a more aggressive approach towards the movie's concepts, such as racism, corruption, and injustice. This somewhat mild advance on us displaces the film on a level just short of profound. 	The film's theme of action propels the screenplay along  a lengthy road of focused dramatic tension. Also furnishing the picture's visual narrative style, 'The Hurricane' embodies superlative dialogue that is on the level of merit equal to a lesser 'Forrest Gump.' The actions and dialogue support each other here, constructing a strongly structured production.'The Hurricane' is more about racism than injustice, more thematic in nature than subjective. It proves a solid moral about what society is like. A point that is powerful and touching because of its strong development...but also saddening because it's true.

A Clockwork Orange," The number one film of all time. **** out of ****
","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) ****Starring: Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, and Adrienne Corri Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick   137 minutes    Rated R (for strong explicit sexual content and rape, perverse nudity, brutal violence, and some language)By Blake French:	Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' holds the recent record of being the number one film of all time on my charts. The film is everything that you'll never want to watch. The scenes are disturbing, gut wrenching, mind twisting, and way over the top. In result, 'A  Clockwork Orange' has the most powerful and overwhelming dramatic impact that I have ever experienced in a mainstream film. 	'A Clockwork Orange' is the story of a young man named Alex DeLarge, who is, by day, a regular student who lives with his parents at home, but, by night, a homicidal rapist/killer with his accomplices who dress up like demented clowns at a bleak freak show. He and his buddies weasel their way into the happy homes housing innocent people by chanting the same deceiving phrase every night: they scream that their friend has been critically wounded in an accident near by--and plead to use their telephone to call for help.For a few unfortunate souls, this devious trick proves to be successful in nature. One night, however, a woman known as 'The Cat Lady,' refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion. Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside. Once indoors, a fight begins. A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by 'Cat Lady,' one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder. Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise.
After the process of being sent to prison, Alex grows to learn to tell offices and guards what they like to hear. He reads the bible, is never involved with any major fights or complications, and almost volunteers for a new kind of experiment. An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps. What it does, though a series of 'sessions,' is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.The scenes involving the 'cure' of Alex's disturbances are truly emotionally troublesome. They are so explicit and detailed that I myself felt tempted to look away from the screen at points. This is not a film for those who are prone to walk out of movies, those who are easily offended, or especially for those with week stomachs. This is the most grizzly enumerated film I have even screened, but it happens to be one of the most perfect and precise in message.  I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though. The soundtrack to 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the most inspirational and spirited ones I have ever heard; right up there with the turns to 'The Graduate' (1967). Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.Here, a young Malcolm McDowell explores the character of a lifetime with vivid imagination and tremendous description. His character fits him very well as an actor. Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind. Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement. It investigates the mind of a killer, rapist, and a confused, somewhat harmless, adolescent--all existing in the same character. This is no doubt the character, and the performance, that inspired a generation.As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to 'A Clockwork Orange' also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes. There is a scene in this movie that forces two parents to make a decision of a lifetime. After receiving the treatments he volunteered for, Alex returns to his household only to discover that the only mom and dad he's even known have rented his old room out to some strange college kid, who is said to have been there for them during many hard times--like a real son. His parents must make a choice: to throw their only son, who has suffered for years in turn for making others suffer, out of the house for good, or allow him to return with open arms trusting that he is 'cured.'

From Hell," A few nice sequences, exquisite performances, a convincing technical department, and a superb third act. But the execution of the ideas doesn't work. **1/2 (out of four
","FROM HELL / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)It is the dramatically gruesome ideas that make this film what it is, but it is the poor execution of those ideas that makes this film what it is not. 'From Hell' contains a few nice sequences, exquisite performances by Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm, a very convincing technical department, and it has a superb third act. Unfortunately, despite those positive factors, the film as a whole doesn't quite work. Jack the Ripper committed five gruesome, ritualistic murders during a ten-week span in London during the fall of 1888. He was never caught. As the first tabloid star of the twentieth century, he is remembered as one of the most notorious serial killers in history. 'From Hell' does not successfully bring him to life, though the Hughes brothers certainly breathe life into the era. The film's sets were created by Academy Award-winning production designer Martin Child. He and seventy artists and carpenters constructed a 20-acre set near Barrandov Studios. Their hard work pays off; the film embodies an entirely believable design. It's a great achievement from a technical standpoint. Based on a popular graphic novel, 'From Hell' referrers to the return address on a letter from Jack the Ripper. The always entertaining Johnny Depp stars as it's recipient, Fred Abberline, a tormented Inspector who seeks temporary relief with opium. His unendurable addiction gives him visions of the future. Let's have some more about Abberline's internal struggles and opium addiction. Let's dive into his mind and explore the source of these visions and addictions. This is a very intriguing aspect of the character, but the film never really develops this subject. Instead we get a shallow, flat concept that never leaves ground. Inspector Abberline is called to duty when a vicious serial killer takes the lives of several prostitutes. As the bodies start piling, the inspector realizes his superiors are far more interested in preventing public panic than finding the killer. One figure, however, named Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), takes interest in Abberline. As a physician to the royal family, Gull is a powerful enough figure to assist Abberline in his investigation. They discover a secret that threatens everyone who knows it.
Albert and Allen Hughes direct the film with a sense of precise detail. They took extreme measures to assure the film's effectiveness. They softened the lighting by placing a silk cloth over the rear of the lenses. They shot the flashback sequences on positive film. Fast motion and time-lapse photography give the movie a unique flavor. The cinematography creates an ominous presence. The Hughes' failure lies not within the technical aspects of the film, however, but within the misconnection with the audience. Despite a plot about the mystery and horror of Jack the Ripper, the movie is not particularly scary, nor does it work as a mystery. Watching the movie, I never found myself guessing the identity of the killer, nor did I follow the characters, or identify with which victim would be the next to go. There is no real sense of a puzzle here; the script does not give us enough to care about the killer or his victims. Much has been said about the film's violent content. Although it certainly suggests strong, gruesome violence, we seldom actually witness it. 'From Hell' does contain some of the most grotesque images I have seen in film, but as a whole, Jack the Ripper's violent acts are not witnessed, but implied. During the murders, we usually only see a quick flash of a knife, and then partial glimpse of the aftermath of the victims. It's a letdown, since it's one of the few interesting things in the movie. 
All of this notwithstanding, even if there was more stomach-churning gore it would not have saved the movie. Violence relives tension, and 'From Hell' does not build a single iota of suspense. No wonder why there is no sense of mystery or intrigue; for most of the film, we are sitting flat on our butts. In a movie like this, we want to be on the edge of our seats. To make matters worse, this film is almost two hours long. You know the sensation you get in your butt when you drive a car for a really long time? That cramped, anxious feeling that makes you want to get out of the car and stretch? That's how I felt during this movie.",6,16,39,6 November 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Hypnotic intensity; absorbing performances; perfect direction; one of the greatest films of all time. **** (out of four)
","Stanley Kubrick's last film, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a cross between an exotic fantasy and mysterious illuminating thriller. The movie also resembles a dream, whether it be a nightmare or preoccupation, as various characters drift in and out of focus during two nights of sexual exploration where opportunities are missed, and or avoided. Audiences have complained about lack of story, immaturity of characters, and slow moving atmosphere, but those elements are what make 'Eyes Wide Shut' distinct: the story is not so much a plot other than a series of events that transpire each other through identity clarification; the characters are extraordinarily deep and involving, mostly because there are too many loose ends for our attention to stop paying attention. This is one of the best movies of the year, possibly decade, another landmark achievement by one of the best American directors of all time.True couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the wealthy Dr. Bill and Alice Harford, who are raising a seven year old daughter in Manhattan. During the film's long, indolent opening sequence, the two attend a society ball thrown in the costly mansion of Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). There, Bill meets an old friend from medical school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), now a pianist. During the party, Bill is nearly seduced by two aggressive, shapely woman and a tall, suave Hungarian tries to sweet talk a drunken Alice. This occurs before Victor requires the medical assistance of Bill after a hooker overdoes in the middle of sexuality.This first half hour is slow and stretchy, but luminous and necessary to develop the intentions and suspicious of characters later on in the story. For instance, when the party is over and Alice and Bill return home, and in their bedroom, stoned on pot, she questions his fidelity using enough perverse terns to startle fans of 'Cruel Intentions.' She eventually admits to fantasizing over a young naval officer she witnessed the summer before while she and Bill where visiting Cape Cod. 'At no time was he ever out of my mind,' reveals Alice, 'And I thought if he wanted me, only for one night, I was ready to give up everything .'It is here where the audience realizes the conflict is the current tension between Alice and Bill. Alice's secret confession is tantalizingly tense as we witness the jumble of emotions in which Bill experiences. This scene is important, and well crafted, and propels the plot into the second act where various, well-structured plot points occur.From this point on our attention is captivated and the film never loosens its grip on the erotically appealing style and an odd, unsettling, sometimes lewd mood for the characters. The film is shot in high-contrast style, with back-lighting, underlighting and convincing primary colors. The story takes place near Christmas so the filmmakers can take advantage of the fantastic holiday tone.Propelled by flashbacks of his wife making love with the naval officer, it is at this point where Bill begins his two night sexual odyssey, entering a world in which nearly everyone reacts to him sexually. He first stumbles upon Marion (Marie Richardson), who's father, an old patient of his, has recently died. She tries to seduce him literally on her father's death bed. Vinessa Shaw plays a particularly friendly hooker in which he has an alleged encounter, maybe intercourse, maybe not. Milich (Rade Sherbedgia) is an eccentric, patriarch costume store owner who seems to be advertising sexual favors for his young daughter (Leelee Sobieski). Arranged by Nick, Bill is then given the password to a secret country house orgy, in which he watches, but never experiences, ritual-like sexual activities. He later comes in contact with a queer hotel clerk (Alan Cumming), who makes it clear that he finds Bill attractive.The film's story feels as if it revolves around the illustrative orgy sequence in a country estate, where Bill wanders around viewing masked individuals performing a variation of sexual acts with each other. This sequence is of the best ever witnessed in film; it has extraordinary intensity and hypnotic suspense. The cinematography is eye candy for the mind; the architecture is dreamlike in appearance. This tantalizing famous scene has undergone digital alterations to hide the most graphic sexual content. The more explicit sex is seen in question from a distance, and is more for the imagination to ponder upon rather than actual acts. If these alternations where not made, the MPAA would have slapped this masterpiece with an unwanted NC-17 rating. However, even with the cuts 'Eyes Wide Shut' deserves an NC-17 rating with the profound amount of nudity and sexual explicitness. This movie is strictly intend for adults to experience. Warner Bros. has sacrificed Stanley Kubrick's masterful vision in order to make the film more appropriate to younger viewers. That is a joke.The film is true Kubrick material; the way he pays attention to each individual scene and character; the aggressive and perverse sexual content; the ample amounts of female nudity. All elements follow tradition with his pervious achievements, such as 'A Clockwork Orange.' Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfection as they explore themes of morality, sorrow, remorse, emotion, grief, seduction, jealousy, pleasure, and love. Kubrick also produced and co-wrote the production; with precise, distinct dialogue, Alice's confession scene has intense verve. Stanley Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted with 'Eyes Wide Shut' and it appears he got it.Stanley Kubrick tragically passed away in March of 2000. We lost a true component to the defining of American cinema. It is hard to believe he would have accepted the modifications placed on his success. 'Eyes Wide Shut' should have been released as he made it, regardless of the MPAA mumbo jumbo. Nevertheless, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is an engaging, memorable and haunting experience for mature audiences only. Kubrick has constructed his final contribution to audiences and fans everywhere, and it is one of his most artful and brilliant. He will be missed for the great director he was.",9,0,1,7 November 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It's a true adaptation, but lacks an edge like the novel. *** (out of four)
","HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?  Before the release of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.
'Harry Potter' certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?
The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle 'Home Alone' and sweet-natured 'Stepmom,' many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. 'Harry Potter' contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define 'Harry Potter' as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",7,50,86,18 December 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Takes a few wrong turns, but ends up effective for people in which it sounds interesting. Good performances. *** (out of four)
","ENEMY AT THE GATES / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	'Enemy At The Gates' takes place in 1942 and details a cat and mouse chase between two snipers. The mouse is a young Russian named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who arrives on the shores of the Volga River to defend Stalingrad, an important city in which the German's are attempting to capture. Zaitsev soon finds himself befriending a political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), who is impressed by the soldiers quick skills and decides to glorify him through the local press. Zaitsev becomes a political icon for the locals, giving them encouragement and increasing their hope for victory. 	The cat is an opposing sniper named Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a famous sharpshooter called upon to kill Zaitsev. Koulikov (Ron Perlman), another talented sniper, is assigned to help Zaitsev in killing Koenig before the Major takes a victory shot. To further complicate matters, Zaitsev falls in love with another soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz), whose parents were killed by the enemies, and wants to redeem their honor. 	'Enemy At The Gates' certainly paints a vivid, graphic depiction of war. The atmosphere is unsettling and bleak, the characters are almost always dirty and sleepless, the fighting scenes consist of brief, short, instantaneous shots, but the sequences are fast-paced, genuine, and disturbing. The city looks battered and tormented. The dialogue goes hand and hand with the character's actions; the plot is challenging and the movie is focused, about something solid. In the sequences where Koenig and Zaitsev challenge one another, the tension is very effective. The movie tends to realize that, and concentrates a great deal of effort in making those scenes suspenseful and taut. 	Joseph Fiennes plays a meek, nervous character and does a good job at bringing him to life believably. Jude Law, whose last work in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' provides a tough act to follow, accomplishes great things with a determined and assiduous character. Ed Harris is the standout actor here, in a harrowing, steadfast, juicy performance. Rachel Weisz cannot do a whole lot with her character, however. She often feels strained and contrived.
'Enemy At The Gates' tries hard to express the subject of the media's influence in our culture. If the film, co-written and directed by Jean-Jaques Annaud  ('Seven Years in Tibet'), would have stayed on that concept, it would have been a whole lot better. The romance between Zaitsev and Tania is kind of unnecessary, and I am not sure if the sex scene is obligatory or advances their relationship. This love side story lacks passion; a lot of it feels mechanical and routine. 'Enemy At The Gates' is still a consistently intriguing war film-rare because it does not involve Americans. While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective. 'Enemy at the Gates' is worth seeing if it sounds interesting to you.",7,54,102,14 April 2001
Psycho," One of the best horror films of all time. **** out of ****
","PSYCHO (1960) ****Starring: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, Janet Leigh, and  John McIntire Director: Alfred Hitchcock   Running time: 109 minutes    Rated R (for scenes of strong violence)By Blake French:	Alfred Hitchcock is easily one of the most acclaimed directors in film history--right up there with Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg. His films defined horror for generations, especially with what many people are still calling the scariest movie of all time: 'Psycho.' Over the years, the movie has been given much praise. It has had the honor to be placed in the American Film Institute's best 100 movies of all time list. The film has had the privilege to be re-created in 1998 by great director Gus Van Sant, who also added new actors and coloration to this classic tale. 'Psycho' also has had the fortunate pleasure to have been followed up by several time-lapsing sequels, although not equal in quality, which continued the story and characters beyond the original film's restrictions. On top of all this, the movie has a unique story line, unusual characters, imagination-provoking motives, and manages to conduct its rare structure like no other film. 'Psycho' is one of the better thrillers of our time. 	First lets take a look at the unique but perfectly organized structure of this classic horror tale. It beholds what I call a false first act. The first act opens by introducing a character named Marion Crane, sister of Lila Crane, who steals $40, 000 from her employer one day and is in the process of leaving town when her situation is complicated even more. Marion is pulled over by a mysterious police man, who checks out the circumstances, and then allows her to continue on with her journey. He then follows her many miles to a car dealer, where Marion cleverly trades her current car in for a used junkie to camouflage herself from peering foes. Marion then continues to drive along the busy highway until a shielding rainstorm persuades her to stop to rest at The Bates Motel. (spoilers ahead) Then she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who explains to her that his mother is a lunatic. Marion then goes to her cabin where she is stabbed to death in the shower by an unknown predator who looks like an old woman.
	Extraordinary, a simply flawless false first act. The movie introduces a character, a problem, and complicates it for the character involved. Then the conclusion (the murder of Marion) solves the first initial problem, throwing us off balance. While we recover, the filmmakers open a brand new series of events, this time detailing the missing Marion Crane. A detective, Milton Arbogast, who tries to investigate Norman's mother, is also killed in the process of doing so. Lila's investigation of her own evolves the second act problems, all winding towards the same awe-inspiring denouement, which I will not have the audacity to reveal to you. 	Now for some nice pointers for 'Psycho': The opening scene develops Marion Crane's romantic characteristics as well as her personal morals. The scene in which Marion decides to commit theft is never explained to us through dialogue like many lesser films would do, but through Marion's complex stares at the cash and her reactions to it. The police officer's behavior is a whole plot in itself, and since the character's point of view is so focused, we know nothing more about this suspicious man than Crane herself. The Atmosphere of the Bates Motel is one of the creepiest moods I have ever experienced in the movies. Not to mention the famous shower scene, certainly the most shocking and grisly slasher moment of all time. The investigation of Marion's disappearance has a specific odyssey to it--intriguing and unsatisfying. All these minor elements contribute to making 'Psycho' the most talked about films ever. 	There is a small, but quite noticeable, opinion flaw in the last ten minutes of 'Psycho,' however. It is the scene where the detective explains the disturbing behavior of Norman Bates to the film's remaining characters, but also to the audience. This scene has never been necessary. The picture would have ended with much more controversy and fantasy if the writers would have left the strangeness of Norman to the imagination rather than explaining elements to us, not to mention the fact that all answers are revealed in the many sequels. I think it would have been interesting to see what happened if Gus Van Sant would have left that sequence out of his re-make, after all, he added a lustful masturbation scene, so why couldn't he have taken out some unneeded material as well. Oh well, I guess, until another actor attempts to master the terror found in the eyes of Anthony Perkins, we'll just have to juggle around these ideas in our minds of how this near-perfect movie could have been better. Don't you love it when movie's make you do that!Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures.",10,20,37,27 October 1999
The Green Mile," One of the most penetrating films of the past several years. **** out of ****
","THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)
By Blake French:	It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. 'The Green Mile' is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by  Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. 'The Green Mile' is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.  The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. 	Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.
I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.'The Green Mile' contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from 'American Beauty' in the best performance of 1999. 
The message to 'The Green Mile' is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. 'The Green Mile' is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. Brought to you by Warner Bros.",10,221,262,25 January 2000
Platoon," One of the most vivid, anti-war movies every made. Superior performances. **** (out of four)
","PLATOON / (1986) **** (out of four)'Platoon' was one of the first movies to portray its subject in a way that does not glamorize war. Many war movies, such as the recent 'Pearl Harbor' and 'The Patriot,' create an involving sense of adventure and strategy, thus shinning an entertaining light on combat. 'Platoon' set the standards for war movies to follow. It is an unmistakable, startling depiction of Vietnam. No other war movie more graphically presents its material as believable and disturbing; not 'Apocalypse Now,' 'The Deer Hunter,' 'The Killing Fields,' or 'Saving Private Ryan.' This is the kind of movie young people should watch before they enlist in the army. It will make them think twice about their decision.The film's main character is said to be based on director Oliver Stone's personal experiences while fighting in Vietnam. His name is Chris (Charlie Sheen) a college student who enlists in the military because he believes it to be his patriotic duty. The movie introduces the character's environment uncomfortably well. We sense many soldiers lack rest and fulfillment; many are at the point of physical breakdown. There are long shots of exhausted soldiers wandering through the woods, potential danger lurking behind every tree. A snake slithers around a soldier's leg. Dozens of red ants crawl down a resting man's neck. We can almost feel the enormous weight of their backpacks on our shoulders. The portrait Stone paints is unimaginably vivid; we squirm in our seats.The soldiers often sit around, discuss things of no importance, use drugs, dance, and act like general fools. The film portrays the soldiers as many might believe actual soldiers behave. 'Platoon,' gives each character a personal dimension. The actors inject a taut edge into the characters. Charlie Sheen creates the illusion that Chris listens and thinks about the words and actions of others. He is an inquisitive, just character, displayed with a sense of unease and frustration. Willem Dafoe, arguably at the center of the film, delivers a strong performance as a skilled fighter, but a man who tries to escape the horrific realties through drugs. The most thought-provoking, powerful performance comes from Tom Berenger, as a sadistic, determined veteran sergeant with a face deformed by a vast history of bullet wounds. Even the supporting cast, including Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, and Tony Todd, convincingly display a sense of fear and disorientation.
'Platoon' makes clear that war is hell. Oliver Stone writes no actual plot, but instead a collection of scenes that do not contain adventure, strategy, or orientation. We realize any character could die at any given time. The enemy is not given personality, or even a point of view. We see them as the soldiers see them, as distant figures in the jungle paths. They provoke a clear impression of danger lurking from all around. There is little evidence of choreography or style. The battle scenes has no order. Most of us will never know what war is like, thank God for that. But movies like this can give us an appreciation of combat, and of Vietnam.I would like to close this review with the final lines of the movie. I feel these accurately conclude the statement 'Platoon' makes about Vietnam.
'I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves. The enemy was in us. The war is over for me now, but it will always be there, the rest of my days. As I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 'possesion of my soul.' There are times since, I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again. To teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.'Charlie",10,1,1,10 June 2001
Scream," One of the scariest slasher movies ever made--one of the years best films. ***1/2 out of ****
","SCREAM (1996) ***1/2Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Liev Schreiber, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler Director: Wes Craven   Running time: 111 minutes   Rated R (for strong grizzly violence and gore, language, and some sexuality)By Blake French:	'Scream' is the mother of all teen slasher films. From the opening sequence to the somewhat silly closing cliffhanger, it is one of the scariest productions of the past several years. Now, about the opening sequence, it features a penetrating Drew Barrymore receiving prank phone calls from a man with a deep, mysterious voice, who becomes more and more conversationally aggressive as they talk. 'What's your name--because I want to know who I'm looking at.' After building up some very effective momentum, the scene has a heart-stopping climatic payoff that isn't only  pointless gore, but terrifying suspense. It is moments like these that make 'Scream' one of the best movies of 1996. 	'Scream' centers on a high school girl named Sidney Prescott, a modestly productive young woman who spends much of her time alone and with her boyfriend, Billy. She is approaching the anniversary of her mother's murder, whose killer has been convicted and sentenced to death. Sydney's school is in the process of mourning the brutal murder of two fellow classmates, and the pupils aren't exactly sympathetic.One night Sidney is home alone, and receives a phone call similar to the one in the opening scene. Sidney is tormented in that call, and after an exchange of a few unfriendly words, attacked by a dark individual wearing a white ghost mask. She fights him off, however, and lives another day, much in regard to the mysterious appearance of her boyfriend and a young, squeamish cop named Dewy. 	The presentation of Sidney's life is not one-dimensional. The overlook on her schooling experiences, classmates, relatives, friends, and teachers are all believable. Strongly supporting the character are the details and sub-characters. 	It is nearly impossible to watch 'Scream' without making a list of assumed suspects to the numerous killings that take place. Here is my prediction list of murderer suspects, not telling who, if anyone, is the correct guess:· Dewy, the young police officer who suspiciously shows up at nearly every crime scene, and has somewhat of a psycho personality.· Sidney's boyfriend, Billy, who is actually sent to prison for a short period of time after being accused as a prime suspect. He also appears at a crime site unexpectedly.· Sidney's  father, whom has motive for murder and is nowhere to be found locally.· A crazy video store clerk who is obsessed with scary movies and who I forget the details of. 	Another element that makes 'Scream' so great is the content of the murders. The victims aren't just helpless plot puppets waiting to die like a mannequin, but real people who want to live. Each puts up a good fight in defending themselves, and several nearly escape the killer. The characters who die are often unexpected, members of the main cast--making this production unpredictable. 	The performances are electrifying in Wes Craven's highly acclaimed horror film. The actors act with dramatic intensity and the characters are perfectly cast. Each character is explored with suspicion, and due to Craven's direction, the villain's identity remains a mystery until the lazy finale. I am an experienced filmgoer, and I thought that I had the killer picked out at mid point in the film. But I was so wrong--the film had me fooled all along, and that is not an easy thing to do. I had no clue of who the killer actually was. 'Scream' contains so many twists are turns that by the end of the movie, I couldn't have correctly predicated the killer's identity if my life depended on it.

Carrie," Not a scary movie, just a major let down. ** (out of four)
","CARRIE / (1976) ** (out of four)
In 'Carrie,' the acclaimed vision of Stephen King's novel, we meet a character who doesn't have good days, joyful moments, or times that she can laugh with friends. The title character is played by Sissy Spacek, who, under the circumstances, does very good things with her character. Carrie's mother has raised her under a constricting environment of fanatical religion and strict discipline. As both the novel and the movie open, we meet Carrie White, a high school senior who has a very complex body; she is telepathic-contains the ability to move objects with her mind-and she has never had a period. Now, I know I am becoming graphic in my explanation, but this is an important aspect of the story. The audience assumes from the implications and plot points that Carrie has had a rather cloudy history as a person and student. Her neighbors look away as she passes, her fellow students pitch tampons at her when she experiences her first vaginal bleeding in the school showers. These are the only things that develop Carrie White as a character-the rest is up to you to assume. In a movie where the main character kills countless presumably innocent individuals due to unkempt rage and years of building aggression, we better be able to understand her, but  the movie does not provide us with the right material.
The problem with 'Carrie' is not so much a problem with the movie itself, but a problem with the novel by Stephen King, and the adapted script by Lawrence D. Cohen. I read the novel before I saw the movie. I obtained a videocassette copy for critical screening to compare the two arts. I hated the book. Stephen King confused his simple, one-line story with frequent scientific rationalizations of the occurrences within the actual novel. It is like he didn't trust the reader with his idea, and felt the need to provide us with factual evidence that the story could actually happen. This distorts the narrative, and provides the reader with nothing but more questions. I like the movie better than the book because it is more visual. Although King wrote some vivid, picturesque scenes in his vastly popular work, 'Carrie' makes for a much clearer screen presence because it is not so jumbled with awkward ideas and interceptive explanations. However, I still dislike the movie. Screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen does not alter King's depiction of the characters-one of the biggest problems with both the movie and the book. The character's in 'Carrie' both in the movie and in the book, are all one-dimensional and stereotypical. The mother is a religious fanatic obsessed with finding forgiveness in everything her daughter does; the kind hearted counselor befriends Carrie, boosting her confidence to where she actually has the courage to accept a young man's invitation to the upcoming prom; the spiteful schoolgirls, obsessed with self-image and popularity, vow for revenge against Carrie, when Carrie herself was simply a victim of cruelty; need I go on? The character's are all seen in one light, and one light alone. The kind counselor never does anything mean. Carrie's mother sees everything as a sin against the Lord. Even Carrie herself is over the top in shame, hopelessness, and confusion. I never cared about any of the characters, therefore, instead of being terrified and involved when the film's disappointing but violent climax transpires, I was left analyzing my thoughts of why I didn't care in the least about what happens.'Carrie' isn't a terrible movie. I liked the scenes at the prom and beyond; it has a good sense of style and momentum. It proves that Lawrence D. Cohen has a mind of his own, instead of using identical material to the novel. But it is overrated, tiresome, and often boring. This is not a scary movie-just a violent, abhorrent one. It contains all the necessary ingredients to make for a tantalizing, suspenseful motion-picture-but it never delivers. There are avid horror principles here, but 'Carrie' doesn't seem to understand what to do with them.",5,5,15,1 June 2001

That is what makes Ted Demme's 'Blow' different from other drug movies-it does not portray its characters as addicted lowlifes, but as recklessly successful, high powered individuals who simply want to live the American dream. The film is based on the true story of George Jung, whose image went from the average Joe next door, a high-school football star from a small Massachusetts town, to the world's premiere importer of cocaine from Colombia's Medellin cartel, who once supplied the States with over 85% of the total amount of imported cocaine in the 1970's and 80's. 'Blow' is one of the best movies of the year.	'Blow' covers a wide range of generations and locations, ranging from the turbulent 60's to the haze of the 80's, and from such areas of the North America like Massachusetts, Florida, Colombia, California, Mexico, New York and Illinois. The time and location span provided the filmmakers with a challenge. The film was shot in a variety of locations in Southern California and in Mexico. 'It was a difficult film to schedule and shoot because it had so many different time periods. And since it was the story of a man's life, every scene was fairly brief which meant an incredible number of scenes to be shot,' explains executive producer Georgia Kacandes.
	Covering so many years in a single film also tests the ability of the film's costume designers and makeup artists. The wardrobes, makeup and hair styles appear authentic and  impressive. This movie pays close attention to even some of the most minute of details. 	George Jung's motives for pursuing drugs may have been triggered by his family life as a child. His father was a nobody construction worker who often struggled with money and his marriage. In the film, Ray Liotta plays George's poor but content father, with the versatile Rachel Griffiths as his bitter, unhappy mother. George vows to never live his life in poverty, no matter what. 	He moves to California as a young adult where selling marijuana supports his independent lifestyle. Paul Reubens and Ethan Suplee play George's drug-dealing comrades. Eventually, the authorities send him to prison for a while, where he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla). An insider in Colombia's rising drug trade, this man educates George about the profits of selling cocaine. After serving his time, Jung becomes partners with Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis), the billionaire godfather of international cocaine trafficking.	'Blow' displays a consistent and detailed portrait of the spectacular rise, and dramatic fall, of Jung and his travel towards turning powder cocaine into American's biggest drug problem. Ted Demme's direction is vivid, determined, and stylish. He reportedly conducted many interviews with the real life George Jung, as he makes very clear the early high life, and the dangerous reality of a drug smuggler's everyday lifestyle. Demme is careful to stay away from frequent potential distractions, like the drug use, side characters, family issues, and romantic interests. This is a vivid narrative of a very interesting character. It does display a message about drugs that we have seen before, but never in this stylishly innovative light.
Laced with amusing detail and probing awareness, 'Blow' defies the usual road of drug movies and provides us with tension and interest from Jung's many experiences-risky border crossings, ferocious consultation, unexpected deception, the persistence of the authorities, and unconquerable temptations. But untimely the film shows the true tragedy of losing your dreams to greed and drugs. Johnny Depp proves once again what a triumphant, adaptable actor he can be. He portrays George Jung with the perfect amount of greed, style, confusion, pride, and desperation. The real George Jung is in a prison cell in New York. Without possibility of parole, Jung's release date is scheduled for 2015. Depp acknowledged the responsibility that comes with dramatizing a true individual, but also the responsibility of the director. 'I knew Ted was committed to the film, but I didn't understand how deeply committed he was to the real George.''Blow' becomes one of the most intriguing movies of 2001, but it even suffers in comparison to the incomprehensible achievement director Darren Aronofsky accomplished last year with his disturbingly real display of the downward spiral of four drug addicts in 'Requiem for a Dream.' That film gave us a cinematic taste of what drug addicts experience through their addictions and depravity. 'Blow' still shines a fresh new light on drugs in movies, and perceptively portrays the story of a person from whom many can learn.",9,151,186,23 May 2001
The Iron Giant," An entertaining and heartfelt cartoon version of 'E. T.' and 'Star Kid. *** out of ****.
","THE IRON GIANT (1999) ***Starring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, and Eli Marienthal Directed by Brad Bird. Running time: 87 minutes. Rated PG (for animated violence and mild language) By Blake French:	'The Iron Giant' is much like a cartoon version of 'E. T: The Extraterrestrial' and 'Star Kid.' It is an effective, empathetic journey into the life of its characters. Although the film is animated, it keeps a mature edge on its concepts. There are no outrageous characters, over the top musical numbers, or a bombarding number of shallow, unbelievable happenings. This is an animation in which children will enjoy for its message, but also adults because of its qualities and depth. If we were to replace the cartoons with real people, that would be possible here. That is how down to earth this movie is.	The story details the life of a lonely boy named Hogarth Hughes, who is about nine years of age. He lives a very dual and boring lifestyle with his mother, Annie. He has made a hobby of gathering animals from the wild to be his household pets. His mother is a very busy individual, working full time as a waitress for a small town coffee shop.	This is a fabulous, descriptive opening. We learn several elements about the characters, structure, as well as the movie's style. We learn that Hogarth's single mother is extremely busy and has little time with her son. We also see that due to the significant time this child spends alone, he has a great imagination. This is the internal problem, that Hogarth is somewhat lonesome spending all this time by himself. This film has well-developed characters, better than some more adult movies.	One day, while alone in the house watching television, something happens to Hogarth. His electrical power supply to his TV set goes bad. In a desperate attempt to fix the problem, he climbs on the roof of his house to discover half his antenna has been bitten off. What could have done this? The first clue is the massive footprints leading into the woods. Whatever made these prints destroyed everything in its path. The thing that caused the destruction, technical difficulties, and placed colossal holes in the ground, is a massive iron giant from space who has recently crash landed on earth. Hogarth quickly greets the robot and makes friends with it. The story propels from there after we see the humanity and gentle attitude of the android whom we share empathy with and are able to understand and relate to. The first act is solid and clear cut, proving to us that this is not only a well-animated cartoon, but also a well structured one. 	The film introduces the external problem when an insane detective places his nose where it doesn't belong and discovers the gigantic metal creature. Hogarth is forced to keep his robot secret so that it is not taken away. This detective's purpose in 'The Iron Giant' serves as more than meets the eye. His motives are understandable and developed, although shows signs of existing as a plot device rather than a real character. Also, he is used to increase the line of dramatic tension as he grows closer and closer to finding the robot. This is a very sufficient and well-written character who contributes to a lot of positive material and many possibilities for the film.  The only problem I had with the film is how it never actually explained what the iron giant was. It is an amazing creature, able to heal itself, shoot out lasers, contribute in conversations, and yet we never know how it is able to do these things. Did it come from another plant seeking help for its dying race? Is it on a mission to gather important materials for its existence? Perhaps the android was built by a cruel human inventor on earth but was overtaken by the size of it ands thus allows it to escape into space and become lost--leaving the iron giant no choice but to return to his home where he discoursed along the way and crashed. The possibilities are endless. Too bad the filmmakers took such a shallow look at our title character, otherwise, this would have been one of the year's most entertaining family films.

Vanilla Sky," excellent filmmaking supported by excellent performances. ***1/2 (out of four)
","VANILLA SKY / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)(WARNING: Depending on what you already know about the film--this article may contain a spoiler. It does not, however, give away the ending.)By Blake French: Excluding setting and soundtrack differences, 'Vanilla Sky' is very similar to 'Open Your Eyes,' the 1997 Spanish production it is based on. 'Open Your Eyes,' Alejandro Amenábar's existential thriller, questioned the realm of reality as it combined the filmmaking styles of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch. 'Vanilla Sky' blends the thematic depths of the same directors, but the styles of the two movies feel worlds apart. Director Cameron Crowe adds his own ingredients to this complex recipe; his version is more of an update to the original film than a remake.    With heartwarming movies like 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry Maguire,' we never would have expected a film like 'Vanilla Sky' from Cameron Crowe. But he expands himself far beyond our expectations with this complex, enigmatic, wonderfully frustrating tale. It's a side of Crowe we have never seen before, and it is a pleasant change of pace.The film opens with one of the most impressive sequences filmed all year. David Aames (Tom Cruise), sprints down a barren Times Square, frantically searching for any sign of life-but there is none to be found. No digital effects were used to create this shot. The city actually gave 'Vanilla Sky' permission to shut down Times Square one Sunday so that the shot could be completed. It has an eerie, frantic sensation that digital alterations would not have accomplished.  David wakes to his luxurious life of wealth and position. He inherited a massive corporation from his father and has been enjoys his power and endless supply of beautiful women ever since. However, his latest bed-buddy, Julie (Cameron Diaz), gets a little too close for his comfort. When she invades his birthday party, David uses his best friend's gorgeous romantic interest, Sofia (Penélope Cruz), as a means to rid himself of her.The following morning, David finds Julie waiting in her car outside his apartment. She admits to following him, but somehow manages to coax him into her vehicle. In a jealous rage, she admits to loving him, accuses David of using her for casual sex, and drives the speeding car off a bridge, killing Julie and deforming David. But is Julie really dead? Is Sofia even a real person, or is she just a figment of David's imagination? David tries to sort it all out in a prison where he has been charged with a murder he does not remember committing.  Cameron Crowe fails to breathe life into a few areas of need, where the original film also lacked. For instance, despite engaging performances, we are never convinced that David and Sofia really love each other. The movie lacks passion. We never feel steam or heat from the screen, not even during an especially absent love scene between Cruz and Cruise. The attitude here is much too external; it questions reality, but never emotion.Also, the movie never shows us the emotion behind David's plastic mask, which he wears to shield his disfigured face. There is a striking scene in a dance club where David wears the mask on the back of his head, making it appear as if he has two faces. A fine metaphor to examine David's vanity, but 'Vanilla Sky' does not provide the proper foundation.Luckily, this isn't a movie about passion or emotion, it's about conviction and ideas. It's excellent filmmaking the whole way through, supported by excellent performances. Despite his status, Tom Cruise allows himself to look hideously deformed after the car crash. His powerful character transformation is even more effective. He swings back and forth between bitter depression and tormented rage. The psychological inconsistencies are the centerpiece of the movie. And Crowe does expand on other areas where 'Open Your Eyes' failed. 'Vanilla Sky' creates a style twice as engaging as the original. Crowe dazzles us with brilliant editing and a lively, pop-culture soundtrack that gives the movie a modern edge. Even so, the twist at the end of this movie feels even less appropriate than in the original, perhaps because the film feels so modern. 'Vanilla Sky' is not like 'Mulholland Drive,' where no answers are given and there is much room for individual interpretation. This movie does provide an explanation-but it's without foundation or reason. We initially question the answers provided because we expect something more revealing, taut, perplexing. No need to look any deeper than face value. This movie explains every last detail in the finale, and the more it insists on explaining, the less interesting it is. Despite a disappointing conclusion and a lack of emotional exploration, 'Vanilla Sky' ranks as one of the best remakes of the year. The movie does exactly what remakes are supposed to do. It pays dues to the original while expanding on the concepts and themes. 'Vanilla Sky' is not better than 'Open Your Eyes,' but at least it's on the same par.",8,0,0,26 December 2001
Any Given Sunday," Loud and obnoxious--leaves us with throbbing headache. Just a really bad movie. *1/2 (out of four)
","ANY GIVEN SUNDAY / (1999) *1/2Here we have a film that has the impact of watching an angry father relentlessly lecturing and yelling at this child at the mall, without a clue of passion, depth, or humanity. The movie is loud and obnoxious, not failing to leave us without throbbing memorabilia: a headache! Half of Oliver Stone's 'Any Given Sunday' is like watching a professional football game up close and personal without the dubbed profanities and explicit remarks. The other half consists of a variety of blunt, unsympathetic characters getting into one verbal fight after another for reasons never really understood. Drowned in production overkill and shamelessly using every cliché in the sports movie play book, 'Any Given Sunday' is one of the most ridiculously over anticipated movies in along time.We do not care about any of the characters here, and the actors cannot get beyond their underlying stereotypes to make the movie intriguing. There is a powerhouse cast, with Al Pacino as a traditional coach of a professional football team, who has reportedly given up 'everything' for his players. Cameron Diaz plays the team's owner, who sees the sport as big business and enormous wealth. Dennis Quaid (about fifteen years too old for his role) is an aging quarterback who requires recovery time after an injury. James Woods is the shallow and self-centered physician for the team. Jamie Foxx plays one of the most hated characters ever written, a football player named Willie Beaman, who represents the younger generation, selfish, arrogant, and concerned more about publicity and popularity than his loving and gracious girlfriend (Lela Rochon).There are plenty of flat themes here, with the main characters all learning valuable lessons about sportsmanship and leadership. Even if the production was more of a respectable attempt at a behind the scenes look into football, Stone's direction is violent and nervous throughout. He thinks we are more interested in watching collisions on the field, sprinkled with ranting and cursing, and when the characters are not hollering at one another, the deafening soundtrack, obviously intended to inspire MTV fans, makes you cringe.What about the football action? Are you expecting top-quality film making and expert technique to inspire us as the players play their hearts out? If so, 'Any Given Sunday' is clearly not your movie. The on-field action, shot with hand-held cameras, is some of the most confusing photography witnessed in movies all year. Just when you think the shot cant get any worse, the camera changes to an even worse angle, and then returns to the original location after the important stuff has already happened. There is no breathing room, either, it is just one aggravating, irrigating, irrational sequence after another. The ending result is impersonal and astoundingly bad.How about the performances from the all star cast? Al Pacino fails to capture his character's reality because, or so it seems, he has such little confidence in the writing. He comes off as dual and uninspired. Cameron Diaz cannot do a whole lot with her character either; she is engulfed in the character's selfish disposition. Dennis Quaid is boring and undeveloped. James Woods is tedious and unintriguing. LL Cool J's role is too small and expected. The few supporting female stars, including Lela Rochon and Lauren Holly, are seen in a sexist light. Jamie Foxx delivers a performance that feels way too much like watching him be Jamie Foxx.'Any Given Sunday' gets credit for a decent commercial design, aimed squarely at young male audiences. There is plenty to please the target audience, lots of off-color humor, sex appeal, bare breasts, naughty words-hey, there is even a few scenes that may interest females. Its locker room sequence where several football players bare all. The style obviously has a lot of irony and guts, but the movie itself is dead in the water.",3,0,0,9 March 2001
The Sixth Sense," One of the years best films--with a jaw dropping final twist. ***1/2
","THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) ***1/2Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, Toni Collette and Glenn Fitzgerald Written and directed by: M. Night Shyamalan   106 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)By Blake French:'The Sixth Sense' is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but 'The Sixth Sense' does it so perfectly and convincingly  that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not.
'The Sixth Sense' tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like 'You lied,' 'You did not help me' and especially mysteriously 'Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do.' He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.
The film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient. After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, 'I see dead people,' the young boy whispers, 'they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead,' he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.The story setup to 'The Sixth Sense' is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle. 
The film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the 'sixth sense' seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like  'come on, get to the point.'
For the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than 'Entrapment.' More jaw-dropping than 'Wild Things.' More compelling than 'Goodbye Lover.' And  more awe inspiring than 'Arlington Road.' It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted  to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material. This is a very tricky ending to succeed with, but 'The Sixth Sense' does it wonderfully.Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures.",9,1,2,22 August 1999
Final Destination," Thrilling with a creepy atmosphere. *** out of ****.
","FINAL DESTINATION / (2000) ***
Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Chad E. Donella, Amanda Detmer, and Kristen Cloke. Directed by James Wong. Written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and James Wong. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated R (for terror violence and language).
	I think it is safe to say every individual has different feelings about death. Some fear it. Others deny it. Most are weary in some way regarding decease. 'Final Destination' is a perfect thriller for skeptics, detailing seven confused individuals who accidentally escape demise, discovering the impossibility of defrauding their destined time. The film's atmosphere provokes cringe through a presumably omnipresent force stalking the characters, producing audience participation whether the Grim Reaper is footsteps away from us all. 	Devon Sawa ('Idle Hands,' 'Wild America') is a high school senior named Alex Browning. He and his French class are at an airport flying to Paris for a field trip with their teacher, Ms. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Once on the plane Alex begins to experience a dream-like vision of the jet exploding in midair killing all of its passengers. As the plane is about to descend, Alex notices his illusion gradually comes to life. This leaves him no choice but to cause a small riot leaving him and six other passengers thrown off the flight. Students Carter (Kerr Smith), the ignorant jerk and girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), Alex's best friend, Tod (Chad E. Donella), other peers Billy (Seann William Scott), Clear (Ali Larter), Ms. Lewton and Alex watch from the airport as their late flight bursts into flames within minutes after takeoff-leaving these characters suspiciously confused about fate.The film wastes no time depicting its setup. The rushed opening leads to lack of character development. Whereas the character's personalities are clear, we feel little remorse for many of them. The dramatic premise is horrific and revealing, playing like an extended 'The X Files' episode without paranormal detectives. 'Final Destination' is creative and full of variety; we witness the plane crash from two different perspectives, as a passenger and an observer. Days after the crash, the survivors begin to die in unusual manners-almost as if a curse of death was placed on them for cheating demise. Alex digs deeper and discovers his companions are being killed by strange coincidences in the order they would have died from the explosion on the flight. In desperation, he attempts to contradict death for everyone remaining while under superstition of two disillusioned law enforcers.
There are a few overlooked characters in 'Final Destination,' mostly adults who seem to have an IQ score in the mid-nineties. The teenager's parents are left out most of the story. There is also a briefly creepy appearance by a mortician but is short-circuited by the plot. He is one of the many characters who end up explaining a lot of the plot to us.	Most recent teen horror romps feature a madman chasing characters with sharp objects. 'Final Destination' is too smart to fall in that cliché, however. It has a punctual reason for inhabiting teens: these are young people full of energy and life, all the more reason for them to fight death.
The film, written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and director James Wong, never explains why the Alex character has visions of upcoming disasters. The idea makes for an intriguing story, but there are no interesting subplots or side characters here. Therefore without being backed up by supporting stories the filmmakers must thoroughly justify the character's reason for being. Wong seems to overlook Alex's illusions, a concept holding the entire movie together. 	Although 'Final Destination' provides many edge-of-your-seat surprises and tension, the film likes to poke fun at many of its scenes. Like the average teenage thriller, the movie takes itself seriously about three quarters of the time-leaving the last quarter as comic relief. Certainly having nothing against comedic sequences in horror flicks, I just prefer a movie true to its genre. Even though 'Final Destination' is nowhere near perfect, it is the truest film to the teen slasher gender along time.

The Matrix," Challenges your ability to follow a storyline. *** out of ****
","Sometimes when a movie makes you  think, I miss the factor and send a negative review across.Does the movie make you think? Absolutely. It is a vary challenging feature. As a matter of fact, this is a good test for your movie understanding ability. It is not quite as confusing and plotless as 'Dark City,' but a lot more high tech then 'Johnny Mnemonic.' It is about the same as in the sense of lots happening on scene at one time as 'Blade', but does not make you dizzy.I Hesitate to recommend the film, however, and in reality, the day I screened the film my star rating was lower than it is today. In other words, my thumb would be jolted down on Friday, April 2, 1999, but today, it is pointed up, with a crutch helping it from plummeting down again.Why did I change my mind to disliking 'The Matrix' to liking it? Well, I thought about it, and BINGO, I thought about it. This movie is very tricky. Hard to follow? Certainly, if you get up to go to the bathroom for five minutes, you'll be lost for all the rest. Movies that threaten for you to pay attention are something to see. Making a thought-provoking film isn't easy, you know.Irrelevant 'The Matrix' is. I won't even get into explaining the film's plot, for it would be a mix-up, only to turn you off. There isn't  a real story here, but there is a base to the movie. See the movie and you'll understand.I liked the dazzling visual effects, which were about as good as 'Dark City.' The filmmakers do suffer from showing the audience a little too much on screen instead of letting us imagine things a bit, but they also make up for that by putting in sub-plots and bizarre camera effects.Also to my liking is the performance by Fishburne and Pantoliano, hard to explain why, however. Laurence Fishburne acts that he is once again on a horror ride in the 'Event Horizon,' Joe Pantoliano provides some comic relief when the film gets too deep. Keanu Reeves is a bit too lost in his dialog and trying to understand what's going on to do much damage on screen.'The Matrix' is not for anyone other than hard core science fiction movie fans. It is simply another addition to the mind numbing array of special effects movies that don't carry along a story with themselves. This is not a great movie, and when I think about it, I have a hard time calling it 'good.' But for an addition to this failing genre, it's a turning point.",7,2,4,11 May 1999
The Replacements," Absolutely awful--what are these big stars doing in this trash heap. 1/2* (out of four)
","THE REPLACEMENTS / (2000) 1/2* (out of four)By Blake French:I have always thought professional sports players make way too much money for what they do.  I hoped 'The Replacements' would make a strong statement about their greed and selfishness. 'You're being paid to play,' a coach explains to his replacement team, 'and I want you to remember that, because the men whose places you've taken forgot that a long time ago.' With dialogue like that, we can explore a funny, biting satire about a social issue. 'The Replacements' isn't the movie I was hoping for and it does not make a stand on greed or anything else. It's a poorly constructed, shamelessly contrived sports comedy/drama/romance about how a football team can win a big game. It's also about love. The main star, Keanu Reeves, who has done much better than this, falls for a less than charming cheerleader/bar owner. We learn this in one of the film's first sequences, where the two love birds stare into each other's eyes as boastful romantic music explodes on the soundtrack. This is the kind of movie where the music sets the tone for the scene instead of the scene setting the tone for the music. Without the music, this movie would not have any tone. Not that the music makes much difference. It still has no tone. It's difficult making a decent sports movie because it must involve the audiences in the story both on and off the field. Oliver Stone could not even do it successfully in 'Any Given Sunday,' but he did a lot better than this. Howard Deutch ('The Odd Couple II') does not stand a chance with this sheepish, cheap screenplay by Vince McKewin. The movie does not even know about the technical aspects of football. Although I would not know a football from a bowling ball, here are a few factual errors the fine folks at the Internet Movie Database discovered:路 The team has to hire new cheerleaders when the players go on strike, presumably because the cheerleaders are unionized as well. However, we never see any cheerleaders on the players' picket lines.路 Falco leaves the team when Martel crosses the picket-line, but most NFL teams carry at least two but usually three quarterbacks in case of injury--Falco would only move to second string, and it would be the second or third string quarterback cut.路 According to NFL regulations, a quarterback (or any other player) is not permitted to remove their helmet in the huddle. Falco does this several times throughout the movie.路 During an extra point attempt, the clock is running. In real football, the clock is stopped during extra point attempts.Gene Hackman gives the movie it's only light as veteran coach Jimmy McGinty. His team, the Washington Sentinels, must win three of their last four games to make the professional football playoffs. A player's strike occurs; those greedy SOB's want more money, as if five million a year isn't quite enough to cover the cost of agents, layers, and insurance on Ferraris. McGinty agrees to hire replacement players. 'They've all played football somewhere, not all of them in the pros. But they all have something unique to bring to the game. We're gonna take those people and try to put together a winning team. If nothing else, they should be fun to watch,' he explains.
Scene after scene, 'The Replacements' proves itself incompetent and foolish. The scenes jump between angry players, romantic struggles, and football games. The film spews much unfitting humor into the mix. In once scene, a woman recklessly drives through oncoming traffic at high speeds. This is a contrived, recycled visual joke that isn't developed or expanded upon. It didn't work in 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' and it doesn't work here. 'The Replacements' also attempts for laughs through the cheer leading team. This is also a shallow sight gag; it does not advance the plot nor does it cover an important niche. There's even a running joke where the football players sing and dance to a popular alternative music number. It makes you wonder what you did to deserve such painful torture. I have been reviewing movies for over five years now. I write four to five film critiques per week-many negative. Even after doing this for so long, and sitting through so many terrible motion pictures, it still deeply discourages me to screen a movie as bad as 'The Replacements,' when I know this kind of material has potential. I not only feel sorry for the unfortunate viewers who sit through this junk, but also for the filmmakers whereas it takes a lot of time and effort to make a movie, regardless of how bad. This was a waste of their time as well. I question why actors like Reeves and especially Hackman would accept such roles. In one scene, a character states:  'I've seen monkey-s**t fights at the zoo that are more organized than this.' One could also say the same thing about this movie.",1,2,8,29 July 2001
Tarzan," Great animation, with massive structural flaws. **1/2 out of ****
","Sometimes I get feeling that audiences delight in Disney movies simply because they're pure, wholesome, family oriented, well animated.and released by Disney. Unfortunately, that is not enough to make a movie worth seeing. The film cartoon version of 'Tarzan' will surely appeal to children under the age of 10, and many conservative adults. Like 'Mighty Joe Young,' however, this film suffers from several structural flaws and a few crucial character bloopers that make this journey into the jungle stand far from becoming a memorable Disney experience.'Tarzan' is the story of a young couple and their baby boy who, while sailing at sea, encounter a disastrous event and become shipwrecked on a large tropical island. They adapt to the new climate and build a massive tree house to for themselves to live in.However, they are not the only family living on that island. For a group of wild gorilla's are active nearby. When a single ape stumbles opon the deserted tree house and discovers that a sneaky tiger has broken into the humble home and killed the parents of a crying baby, she curiously gathers him up and starts back to her family.As in most movies of this genre, once discussed the theory of keeping this child as one of their one, daddy objects and is forever against the new member of the household, but they keep him anyway.The main structural flaw in this movie is the continuousness of  the theory of drama being played over and over: it begins with one problem and ends when it is solved. In 'Tarzan,' the first problem is the shipwreck, and the solution is the family building a tree house. There you have it, enough for an entire movie in itself. Why not detail the family's adventures stranded on a tropical island over the years instead of almost immediately creating an internal problem, the leader of the gorilla pack is against the new family member; Tarzan. Then, how about the boy's problem's with his differences from the rest of his family: another internal problem--one that isn't meant to be solved. The relationship with Jane, another internal problem, will Jane stay with Tarzan or will Tarzan leave with Jane? And with all else happening, the filmmakers had to throw in a villain: Clayton. See what we are dealing with here, one of these stories is enough, but we need not to see every one of them in full, for I was baffled at this film's childish yet complicated plot.The only reason why the above fault didn't totally wreak this movie is because each of the 'mini-movies' is connected with somewhat of a 'through-line,' a basis for story telling that connects events together. 'Tarzan' smartly conceives a firm plot in which one happening leads to another.Another problem with the film is the villain, Clayton, who has no characteristics about him that make him overly nasty, aggressive, evil or memorable. Think of  Jafar from 'Aladdin' and Gaston from 'Beauty and the Beast.'The animation in 'Tarzan' is a breathtaking visual exhilaration. The scenes where Tarzan surfs though the trees and swings on stretchy vines are wonderful. The colors are well chosen, and the film seems well directed.'Tarzan' has enough good filmmaking in it to please the majority of an audience. But if you want to see a movie with high standards and true morals go see 'Instinct,' which like 'Tarzan' details a character who feels different from the rest of us. But unlike 'Tarzan,' that film was precise in it characters, plot, and  concepts for that it is possible to live in harmony with a different species. 'Tarzan' only delivers the stale wish that there are answers out there.",6,2,4,27 June 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Good ideas, an interesting and effective point of view, and nice direction by Neil Jordan, but never really takes of with the material. We expect much more for such great filmmakers. ** (out of of four)
","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE / (1994) ** (out of four)By Blake French:'Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice I never had' Lestat de Lioncourt 	The dialogue, used several times throughout Neil Jordan's 'Interview with the Vampire,' comes from the lips of a vampire hundreds of years old. His name is Lestat de Lioncourt, played with the right attitude and mood by Tom Cruise. He explains to a suicidal Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), that he can either spend the rest of eternity as a bloodsucker, or meet a dreadful demise. Louis chooses to become a vampire. That is the setup for this stylish, well acted, but lackluster drama from the popular novel by Anne Rice, who also provided the film with its screenplay.	The movie is a personal narrative of Louis, but Anne Rice believes it to take a point of view from the audience's perspective. I disagree. Louis is the storyteller here, and I do not think it could be any clearer from whom the story is coming-it is the right angle for the material. The plot is told through the conducting of an interview by a simple-minded reporter (Christian Slater) interested in Louis's complex and intriguing background. 'I'm flesh and blood, but not human,' explains Louis, 'I haven't been human for two hundred years.'	He tells a story of passion, fear, love, death, desire, and need. His history begins in New Orleans during the late 1700's, where he lost his family and lives a life of grief and depression. Louis becomes a vampire after an encounter with Lestat, who wants a similar companion to spend his endless days with. 'That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, and yet I can't recall any sunrise before it. I watched its whole magnificence for the last time as if it were the first. And then I said farewell to sun light, and set out to become what I became,' elucidates Louis in one of the movie's most revealing and understood scenes. 	 There are several key characters who play tribute to the long, continuing life of Louis. There is the child vampire, played uncomfortably by a 12-year old Kirsten Dunst, whom Louis grows to love like a sister-or lover. Dunst is unmistakably miscast in her role, giving her character an annoying, insecure mood. She is simply too young to realize the intensities and requirements of her character. The movie becomes even more unconvincing when several other vampires in Paris, including Armand (Antonio Banderas) and Santiago (Stephen Rea), explain to Louis that he is part of an international secret society.
	Neither Jordan nor Rice make the life of a vampire lookparticularly joyous. That is the point of the movie, to demonstrate that excepting a once in an eternity gift may turn out to be a never ending hell. Throughout the story, many characters beg for the gift of vampirism, but they do not understand the consequences of their desires. 'Interview with the Vampire' captures the ceaseless sadness of being a vampire; we realize their gift is unintrusive, but the other characters covet it like nothing else. 	The movie's success is in its appearance by cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot and production designer Dante Ferretti. They create a moody, atmospheric world for the characters. Much can also be said about the scenes in which the vampires feast on the blood of their victims. Jordan focuses the camera on the eye of the attacking vampire. The film presents the moment of attack as suspecting, but at the same time, tantalizing because of the indulging satisfaction and the perfect timing. 	Several factors of the film are peculiarly vulnerable to logic. Due to the geographical location for the area, the sun can never be directly above Paris. But during one of he film's most important scenes, that takes place at the bottom of a well, the entire floor is directly illuminated. And what about the final confrontation between Louis and Lestat-it's meaningless and brief. Are we really supposed to believe the scene would be this short lived, lacking any kind of imagination or curiosity? It is made clear several times that vampires are immortal, but when one drinks 'dead blood' it appears as if he meets a graphic decease. If they can die, wouldn't the massive consuming fire have finished him off? Either way, the plot requires the vampire to appear again later in the movie, so he does.
	 The film's mood also gets in the way. We just get the same style repeated over and over. A lot of the dialogue is right on the money, but even more of it feels contrived and simulated. After a while-a short while-the movie becomes down right boring, to the extent where I simply stopped caring about the characters altogether. 'Interview with a Vampire' also makes the often misunderstood blunder, which I never grow tired of explaining, in which the filmmakers attempt to blend surreal fantasy with reality. If a movie is intended to be fiction, stay with the fiction. Do not try to rationalize the concepts of the unreal with the real. It just does not blend well. 'Interview with the Vampire' just doesn't know where to draw the line between realism and fable.	 Neil Jordan is a very talented director, and has not made a bad movie with 'Interview with the Vampire,' just a misunderstood one. He does no wrong here. Maybe it is Anne Rice's novel, in which I never read. Various things make the potentially intriguing material go awry, and 'Interview with the Vampire' is a major disappointment. We expect so much more from such a prestigious cast and talented filmmakers, but the only real accomplishment they achieve is coming up with a creative point of view for an otherwise campy production.",5,4,17,17 April 2001
Gladiator," One of the year's best; a startling experience. **** out of ****
","GLADIATOR / (2000) ****Ridley Scott is an master at manufacturing highly visual motion pictures with energetic, luminous stories. 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien' dazzled us with high tech action and suspense. Now the roman epic 'Gladiator' vividly captures the time period and atmosphere in which its characters inhabit. This is an excellent looking production, one of the year's best. The movie is a visual tour-de-France; beautiful scenery, awe-inducing sets, convincing cinematography, and believable costume designs bring the ancient Roman Empire to life on screen.The story, set in 180 A.D., details the bitter life of the highly proclaimed General Maximus (Russell Crowe). We first meet him as he reigns a bloody victory after combating a slew of savage barbarians. Dying roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), greatly respects his favored warrior, and even chooses he, over his conniving son Commodus, (Joaquin Phoenix), to rule the dynasty after his passing. The emperor wishes for Maximus to restore the republican government to Rome.When Commodus perceives his father's intents, he is furious. Before Aurelius is able to explain his final demands to anyone, his own son murders him as well as Maximus' precious family, and orders his father's favorite to death. Maximus is underestimated, however, and escapes his condemnation, only to be captured soon afterward and sold into a slave camp led by the greedy Proximo (Oliver Reed). There, he and several other hopefuls, including Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) and Juba (Djimon Hounsou), are trained as gladiators, brutal and dehumanized warriors who fight one another to the death to amuse a live audience.'Gladiator' contains a descriptive and clear first act. The set up and introduction defines the situations, characters, and motives respectfully. The character development is unordinary although extraordinarily effective; Maximus and Commodus are explained as the story progresses. The audience discovers more about them as the movie intertwines with perplexity. This method of character expansion devises depth and involvement within Maximus, Proximo, and Commodus and his good-hearted relative, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Russell Crowe ('LA Confidential') undoubtedly will be further recognized as a sensational actor after his appearance as the gladiator. This determined actor conquers his role with complexity and optimal intensity. His performance is more solid than his in the Oscar nominated 'The Insider.' Joaquin Phoenix ('Clay Pigeons,' '8MM')  is diabolical and mischievously believable. Connie Nielsen ('Soldier') also shimmers in her timid but decisive performance.The confrontation scenes between Commodus and Maximus are hypnotic. The movie grants profound power when the two arch enemies discover each other's identity for the first time. 'Gladiator' portrays its riveting characters with style and penetration; I really cared about the compelling figures in this movie.I did find a few trifling external problems within this otherwise flawless production. The film's combat sequences are high impact, intensely believable and some of the most involving moments in movies this year. However, the camera work often deprives us from indulging in the shear graphic qualities of warfare. Sometimes the scenes are too sketchy and brief, unlike the fighting in 'Braveheart' and 'Saving Private Ryan.'In a time of the year when high-brow movies are rare, 'Gladiator' offers clever writing, smart dialogue, involving characters, and perfect timing. This film is a feast for the senses, an overwhelming jolt of energy, a touching journey into the past. 'Gladiator' is not merely a movie, but it is an experience.",9,0,0,25 May 2000
Rock Star," We've seen this all before, but the film still captures an honest and insightful attitude. *** (out of four)
","ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	'Rock Star' is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. We have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script, by 'Crazy/Beautiful' director John Stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.	'Rock Star,' originally titled 'Metal God,' stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris 'Izzy' Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. His group becomes irritated with Chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.
	This devastates Chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from TV's 'Friends'). He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They have seen Chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. In an instant, Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.
	A true story inspired the 'Rock Star' concept. An Ohio supply salesman, Tim 'Ripper' Owens, really did replace Rob Halford, the lead singer in Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. 
I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like 'Fear,' 'Boogie Nights' 'Three Kings,' and most recently Tim Burton's lacking remake 'Planet of the Apes.' I am starting to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. 'Rock Star' is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg truly makes 'Rock Star' rock. Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care about these characters a great deal. During the film concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also directed 'Holy Man' and the live action version of '101 Dalmatians') creates a gripping atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. At the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. In 'Almost Famous,' a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. Here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. The filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: 'now audience, the moral of the story is' We understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. The personal discovery for Chris' must be gradual.Fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. 'Rock Star' is not a great movie-see 'Almost Famous' if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in his career.",7,32,40,12 September 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One of the worst movies released in a long time; pointless, and absolutely moronic. * (out of four).
","The Coen brothers are very gifted filmmakers. Considering some of my all time favorite movies, including 'Fargo,' 'Blood Simple,' and 'Raising Arizona,' were products of their excessive capability of making good productions only contributes to the enormous disappointment of their latest effort, 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?' It is as if they took several bad actors to play bad characters thrown in a bad script with bad dialogue and bad situations. Everything about this movie is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. The movie is a complete waste of 106 minutes of your life. It makes sitting on the couch watching 'Survivor' look good. I am sorry to say this but I may hold this one against the Coen brothers for some time to come.'Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?' is your standard road/buddy comedy, but missing comedy, laughs, insight, and interest. The story feels tedious, yawn-inducing, slow-moving and ridiculously stupid. It takes place in 1937, in Mississippi where three convicts escape from a pretty chain gang. They are Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Time Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro), who quickly find themselves discussing their dreams with a crazy blind seer. This man explains the three escapees must travel a long and difficult path before they find a treasure at the bottom of a lake in four days. Being the absolute idiots they are, Pete, McGill, and Delmar find themselves following the advice of this clearly eccentric drifter.The three idiots are pursued by various other characters, including a local sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who's bound and determined to bring the criminals to justice, a young musician (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical abilities, George 'Baby Face' Nelson (Michael Badalucco), a manic depressive bank robber with machine guns up the wazoo, Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a deceptive one-eyed bible salesman, and incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) in a close campaign with Homer Stokes (Wayne DuVall), whose manager (Ray McKinnon) is married to McGill's ex-wife, Penny (Holly Hunter).'Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?' is a moronic shadow of 'Of Mice and Men,' minus the legitimate plot and defined character intentions. This film contains the most annoying of characters; they are bland, boring, dual, dumb, negative-adjective inspiring. What is that you say? The movie's intentions were to induce laughs through the stupidity of the characters? Well, if that were the case I think I would have laughs, or even smiled at that. I found myself moaning and groaning in disgust and agony. Not a single character is the least bit intriguing. That is one of the biggest problems the movie makes, finding a character in which audiences can relate. Maybe if the characters were introduced or developed, or had the slightest interesting personality, then there may have been some involvement.albeit not much.The dialogue is typical redneck blahblah, wooden and straightforward. There is little creativity or sharpness in the writing. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on a poem by Homer, puts you right to sleep, especially in the scenes where the outlaws sit around campfires exchanging depressing, meaningless gibber jabber. The soundtrack is equally as painful, consisting of irritating old-fashion country music, and even some numbers sang by the characters themselves. Those scenes, dragged on way too long, are irrelevant to the story. All of these horrible qualities precede an ending that is not satisfying and inconclusive.'Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?' is just a really dumb movie; there is no other way to explain the quality. It is just really dumb. Not in a funny way. Not in a slapstick way. Not even in a bad movie sort of way. It is inexplicably dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Oh, yeah, did I mention that this movie is dumb. Still considering going to see this junk? Fine, but do not say I didn't warn you.",2,7,17,18 February 2001
