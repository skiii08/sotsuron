The Monuments Men," Monuments Men was 100% Entertainment & History Rolled into One Great Film
","I honestly don't understand why everyone has posted such bad reviews of this movie. It's probably due to expectations rather than reality since every facet of this movie is great (maybe not awesome, but certainly great!). There were dozens and dozens of truly funny moments and almost as many heartfelt scenes that brought this rock- solid man right to the brink of a public emotional break-down. The scene where Bill Murray hears his daughter and grandchildren wishing him a Merry Christmas and singing Christmas carols with tears in his eyes still carries me to the brink of tears. This movie is a wonderful combination of history and nostalgic comedy. In my humble opinion, George Clooney has absolutely NOTHING which might require an apology to Sony. The entire cast did a fantastic job and those folks that bashed this movie either have an agenda or they were just dying to find a vehicle to criticize poor Clooney. This movie is honestly a B+ at worst. I promise that you will not regret these 90+ minutes which are very well spent.With deepest gratitude for Mr. Clooney's (and the rest of the cast & crew's) well-spent efforts,Sean Gusmini",8,2,3,10 March 2015
