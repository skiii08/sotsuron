Deja Vu," What if you had the ability to change the past?
","You would warn yourself not to waste your time on this film. All neat and tidy and a load of crock at the same time. So many instances of knowing whats going to happen before it does (though this is not the makers intention?) it's not true. So conveniently wrapped up with a load of hokum illusions to theoretical physics. This film wants to be many things and just ends up being convoluted. A slick fast-paced 'Tony Scott' action movie while being full of unbelievable attempts to explain a newly discovered ability to bend time and space(such an amazing, surely 'Top Secret'* discovery is at the disposal of the FBI to toy around with. This would of been better with the Governator dishing some cheesy lines as he went instead of Denzel and co taking it so seriously. Bluergh!* Special mention goes to Val Kilmer. Oh Val, why oh why did you do such a great job in your first film only to be rubbish in everything else bar The Doors",4,0,3,26 January 2010
