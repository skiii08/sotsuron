The Rock," My Favorite Movie!!!!!!!!
","This movie is a great movie with great acting, a great plot, and great... well everything. If you want a movie that will keep you on the edge of your feet and will keep you entertained for two hours then choose the Rock. Not only is it action packed but it also has an excellent plot which lots of action movies need. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage were great!!!",Null,2,3,14 August 2001
Shrek," Absolutely Hilarious!
",Shrek is one of my favourite movies! Shrek is an absolutely hilarious movie that will keep you laughing so hard you are going to wet your pants! This movie is one of the funniest movies I have seen and the cast is awesome! Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers are great!,10,0,0,15 August 2001
