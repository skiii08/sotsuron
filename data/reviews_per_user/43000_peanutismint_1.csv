Mission: Impossible III," Not as bad as expected...AND it has Si Pegg!
","Finally, a movie dares to keep the best bits for the actual film rather than spoiling them in the trailer. I went to a staff showing of this last night at my cinema and was expecting a 3rd rate actioner, but J. J. Abrahms really worked hard on this and it shows. Plenty of gadgets, and none of them as 'impossible' as the film's title suggests. Not an invisible car in sight (!!) but rather gizmos that could actually possibly work in reality, using modern technologies. The ending was kind of sudden, although it squeezed every last ounce of action onto the celluloid. Fans of JJ's 'Lost' TV series will notice a direct relation between Ethan Hunt and Lost's 'Charlie Pace' from the episode where he was thought hung and dead, until.... All of this, AND it features the always brilliant Si Pegg in a small but important roll. It may have been sliiightly out of character of the film to include a character of his type, but it's Si Pegg. Cake, meet icing... All in all, a thoroughly explosive film. Will make any box set of all three worth watching all the way through....",8,4,8,4 May 2006
