The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good development of the story with great effects and acting.
","There have been many negative reviews of this film, and the main reason why is because this film split the final book into two parts, thus, this film shows more of a story development rather than a story in itself. It complements the series, but it isn't a film to stand by itself. Having read the books as well as seen the previous films, I quite enjoyed part one of Mockingjay. True, there isn't much action, but we get to see a lot of character development which I'm always hoping for more in movies.The acting was pretty great, though Hemsworth and Moore's portrayal of their characters seemed a bit flat. I guess Hemsworth's Gale has always been rather flat, but I was expecting a little more from Moore. Lawrence captures the emotions of her character well, as does Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch. But for me, Elizabeth Banks was the one who really shined. She isn't on screen for long, but her character's personality is so unique and blatant that you can't help but notice her. She has done a great job in playing Effie Trinket so consistently throughout the series.The effects as well were well done. This had a lot of explosions in it, and thankfully they did not look fake. Also, the graphics for the debris and destruction was really life like.However, there was one major goof that was quite noticeable in the film. While filming propaganda videos to show the other districts, footage that wasn't captured by on-screen characters turned up in the video, which makes one think: who filmed that? There were also several other scenes that had me questioning things like that.Overall, I wasn't disappointed like many were and quite enjoyed it. At first I questioned the splitting of Mockingjay into two parts, but it gives room for them to add more detail into the finale. I can't wait for part two!Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,11,2 January 2015
Scarface," Great acting with interesting portrayals.
","There is a lot of action in the film, and quite a few gory scenes which are gory enough for me to turn my head away. Considering the subject matter however, there was not as much violence as I thought there would be. What makes this movie stand out for me, is that there is structure which follows Montana's rise to success as a drug lord and when there is violence, the violence is explained. I wouldn't say that the violence is justified, but unlike many other action films nowadays with pointless fighting, this film doesn't have that. The acting in the film is pretty great. Al Pacino does a marvelous job at playing Tony Montana. His gradual character change from 'fun bobby' to intense, paranoid, control freak is done so subtly that it is hard to believe he is in character. Steven Bauer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are great in their roles too. Michelle Pfeiffer's character did not have much emotion, as she was probably stoned all the time, so I guess Pfeiffer did well in her role too. This film perfectly depicts the American dream, as Tony proves with hard work (and crime activity), you can come from the bottom and reach the top. However the film also criticizes capitalism, through the rise and fall of Tony. There is no such thing as having enough, and once greed takes over, an unhappy ending is pretty much guaranteed. There is also a great deal many things that I find confusing (for example, his relationship with his sister), and that I dislike (the portrayal of women), but overall it was quite an engaging film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,1,4,27 September 2015
Howl's Moving Castle," Great settings, colours, landscapes and character progression.
","Having read the book of the same name when I was younger, it really had a huge impact on me; Diana Wynne Jones is probably my favourite childhood author. And Howl's Moving Castle was– still is one of my favourite books from her and having read it more times than I can remember, my imagination has come up with a different way to visualize the story. So as the film is really different, it did not really affect the way I imagined the book to be. That being said, though I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki (director and screenplay), I feel that they should have stuck to the book more instead of creating a totally different world.As characteristic of a Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki film, there are lots of expressionistic scenes as well as underlying messages. It has the feel of World War II and Nazi Germany, which could very well be what Miyazaki was going for (Sophie's town was based off a street in France) plus there was an actual war going on in the film. Some aspects too reminded me of Paprika a very expressionistic, confusing and intriguing film, which to this day, I have no idea what is about. This goes for Howl's Moving Castle, though not to the extent of Paprika. There are just some scenes or details in this film that I don't get the relevance to.The character progression was well done, in that we could see the characters growing and maturing, as well as forming stronger bonds between each other. There were points in the film that seemed to slow down but it made it up with the fantastic visuals. The colours and everything were really stimulating and well defined.I remember finding it weird that the book was made into a film by Studio Ghibli because the author is UK based and then I found it even more shocking when I heard that Disney bought over Studio Ghibli. Actually I just found that out. In 2014. How slow am I? Anyway, I just hope they don't destroy the Ghibli reputation and become all Disney like.Read more of my movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,1,4 October 2014
Your Name.," Magical
","When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first few scenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot of time travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but I wasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shifts actually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying to figure out where in the timeline you've jumped to. The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. I can't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphics look realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work. I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is with cartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much more aesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that are used. The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes it so magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. I was thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be both comedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quite different from each other, but both are headstrong and their stubbornness is fun to watch. Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the old and the young.",9,9,14,19 February 2017
The Sound of Music," Great acting and amazing singing that just captures the heart.
","I will always have a soft spot for this film, as I presume many others will too. A film that is the definition of 'classic', and will remain forever in the hearts of the audience.The acting is amazing, evoking many emotions from the audience. Andrews is just phenomenal and fits her character so well; a strong minded and outspoken personality who does as she sees fit. Her character is just so likable and the characters of the children so lovable. The chemistry between all of them is just spot on and you can tell that they have actually gotten close to each other. The acting brings out the sincerity of the characters which may well be why this film is able to transcend time. Though there are some little awkward/cheesy moments in some scenes, but those are easily forgettable.The songs and the way they were sung and executed is just perfect. Disney is phenomenal at making songs to match the lively moods of films and the lyrics are so catchy. I hadn't really known the lyrics to 'Do Re Mi' before, but after paying attention to it again, it's pretty clever.The landscapes are so beautiful and the cinematography does it justice with great panning, aerial shots and the full use of spacing.It is truly amazing how this film has transcended decades and just celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary. A film that gains new fans every year and I hope it will never run out of popularity. With an emphasis on family and love, this is truly a majestic film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,3,10,29 June 2015
50 First Dates," Likable
","The film has great production and visuals though with a satisfactory story. The character of Henry is depicted as a playboy character at the beginning but nothing of what we see of him actually affirms this idea. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are believable as their characters. However, they did feel a little generic and didn't express much emotion. Also, maybe it is the the script development, but I didn't feel like Henry showed much passion or reason for chasing after Lucy (except to make a film out of it). A number of characters ask him this too, and he doesn't give a clear answer. Love at first sight perhaps. Ula (played by Rob Schneider) is Henry's cousin and is pretty much just there for comic relief. His tight shirts and extra short shorts are a sight to behold. The story overall is presented in an orderly manner, going chronologically while sometimes fast forwarding in time. The montages and editing is done in a clear and concise way with little confusion between jumps. There is also some great landscape cinematography in the film, with sunsets and nature settings as the backdrop. I also liked the interactions with the animals. I'm sure they are mostly computer generated imagery but it does look very realistic. Unless it is real in which case the animals are really well trained! It's hard to tell nowadays between what has been manipulated by the computer and what actually occurred before the camera. Regarding the concept of the story, it is definitely an intriguing one. I am not entirely sure of the accuracy of what is presented in the film, and am mainly re watching this for a psych class. There is such a thing as losing the ability to form new memories after an accident (anterograde amnesia) which occurs due to damage in the temporal lobe. However, the specifics as to when the memory is 'restarted' is very vague, but it does seem like waking up with a clean slate every morning is more for the convenience of the film. Overall, a likable film for casual viewing with an interesting concept and some great cinematography but average characters.",6,2,3,17 March 2016
Catch Me If You Can," Innovative
","It is incredible to think that this film is based on a true story, and that a high school student was able to deceive so many people. What an ingenious and innovative kid - for the wrong reasons of course. I am unsure of the accuracy of the film's portrayal of the actual events, but Frank Jr. does seem to be quite mature for his age - at least his persona does. Adding to that, I feel like the romantic encounters (save for Brenda) was probably the influence of Hollywood, or dramatized at the least.Leonardo DiCaprio perfectly encompasses the emotions of an emotionally troubled teen to the T. He portrays his character's naivety well, depicting both Frank's fake confidence and emotional turmoil. Supporting actors and actresses did a good job too. Walken as Frank's father and Hanks as Hanratty both support a kind of father figure to Frank though one is encouraging him not to stop and the other is trying to catch him.The editing is well done with two different timelines juxtaposed against each other. At first it is a little confusing and hard to discern which time period is being shown, but it gets better as the film goes on. What I do not get is the very first scene of the film which shows a kind of game show. Not only is it a weird way to introduce the film it does not fit into the story at all. The film doesn't end with the game show, and it is not mentioned or seen again for the rest of the movie.The designs of the set and the costumes are nicely done and adds to the atmosphere of the film. Also, I liked how there are quite a few cameos with well known actresses (although probably not so well known back then).

If I Stay," Average story but good acting.
","I was really excited to watch this after seeing the trailer, and not to say that I was disappointed but I was kind of expecting a bit more. The whole story basically revolves around her first love and whether she should stay. Though I appreciate that it wasn't as lovey-dovey as most young romances (or high-school relationships) tend to be, I would've liked if there was more to the story other than that.The music element was pretty cool, and I wonder if she really plays the cello herself, because it looked really authentic. Same with the other actors in the band.The acting was pretty good, it wasn't spectacular but it was good enough for the film. Moretz surprises me by the range of her characters, as I first knew her from Kick-Ass which is profoundly different. Blackley does a good job too, though I guess I didn't really feel the connection between the two,and maybe that's why I felt that there was something missing from the film. I didn't sympathize with them and so thought that the film was just all right. Though the parents had real character to them and they played the part of a family really well.Another thing I noticed was that when Hall was a 'spirit' people still tended to move out of her way and it was really obvious. There was this one scene where her friend opens a door and she pushes it a bit further as if for the person behind...which was Hall as a spirit. That was not good. Do people actually see or hear her? If not, it should be consistent throughout. And it also seemed as if she could touch things, though people didn't notice.Read more of my movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,12,18,11 November 2014
The Birth of a Nation," Crazy long, with an ideology that is hard to handle but a masterpiece in its day.
","Keeping in mind that this was made in 1915, the movie was considered to be a huge breakthrough. Griffith did not invent any new cinematic techniques, however was the first one to use a lot of these techniques (tracking shots, wide angle shots, close ups) in one film. He was also the first to create a film this long. It is actually not so boring, but it is just really long. In addition to that, the film's racist ideology makes me wonder why this film keeps being shown in film studies classes. Understandably, it is depicting the historical context in which it was made in, but it really is just so racist. The African-Americans in the film are actually Caucasians with charcoal on their faces and bodies. Plus, the film portrays them as violent and uncivilised people. With its mass actors and wide angle shots of war, this film can be said to be the first blockbuster ever. So for that reason, and that reason only, I give this film a slightly higher rating than I would have originally. Griffith does use cross-cutting rather efficiently and for the beginning of the 20th century, it must have been a shock to watch.Rather than being a film to review, I feel that this film is more of a depiction of film history (which I guess answers my previous question).Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",5,0,0,19 September 2015
The Maze Runner," An overused dystopian atmosphere, but had thrilling action scenes.
","When I first came out of the cinema, I was feeling pretty good about the movie, then I thought about it some more and realized it wasn't really that good. The maze aspect of it was very cool and unique, however apart from that, the whole dystopian world was pretty much cliché.The acting was pretty OK, it was a bit static and felt a bit overacted at times. O'Brien does a pretty good job but I did not like the fact that his character became in the lead so fast after just emergingit did not seem that plausible. Ki Hong Lee, I've known from YouTube and maybe its because I know how he's actually like, so didn't feel that anything was wrong with his acting until my friend said he was a bit awkward. The addition of Chuck was a good detail; Blake Cooper did a great job with his character and managed to get the audience on his side. He also added a bit of a comical element to the film.The effects were pretty cool and helped to establish the complexity of the maze. However, I feel that they didn't play around with the maze as much as they could have. The running/action scenes was about the same every time they ran, a bit repetitive. And I did not get the deal with 'The Grievers', that seemed a bit too sci-fi for this movie. (Wait, is this actually supposed to be a sci-fi dystopian movie? Doesn't seem like it though, that's why the 'grievers' felt out of place.)And don't even get me started on the female character. ONE girl and she does about absolutely nothing. Why do they do this to me. It's like they want me to keep pointing out how sexist films/books are. No doubt she and Thomas will get together in the next film (or they already have in the books, I don't know I haven't (not going to) read them).Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",6,0,1,27 September 2014
Zootopia," Adorable
","The film displays many discourses on real world subjects and for that I give this a thumbs up. Though it may not explicitly refer to the real world, there are definitely similarities in Zootopia in which children growing up can extend to their world. The stereotyping based on appearance and 'biology' was a big theme in the film, and ultimately hints at race (that is how I interpreted it anyhow). I feel that the film did a great job at discussing the stigma attached to certain appearances, as well as finding a resolution to this way of thought. Appearances do not govern who we are, and biology does not dictate who we become. Additionally, the script is superb and keeps audiences engaged. The voice actors did a great job - as did the animators, to create the life of these characters. I also really loved (and was also somewhat annoyed by) the addition of the sloths. They added a comedic and recurrent comedic effect, and their slow motion is both hilarious and frustrating to watch.Though I do think the characters and voice actors complemented each other well, I noticed that certain characters would have accents. For example, the 'mafia' like character, Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche) has a typical Latino type accent and the yoga instructor Nangi (Gita Reddy) has an Indian accent. I was quite taken aback by this and though it is great to have diversity in the cast, the film should not encourage the stereotyping of race and character. Also, large characters seemed to have loud booming voices that correlated to their size, and smaller characters tended to have softer, squeaky voices. Size does not determine pitch of voice, and this reinforces the idea that people who do not conform to this ideal is abnormal.Overall, this is a fun and engaging film with good discourses but disappointing voice stereotypes.",8,8,17,10 March 2016
The Danish Girl," Electrifying
","First off, let me just address one of the biggest issues people have with the film. That Einar, the transgender woman is played by Eddie Redmayne, who is cisgender - which means someone who conforms their gender to the sex they were born with. (Male/female is the sex, defined by the organs you are born with. Being a man/woman is a social construct which identifies your gender). So Redmayne identifies as a man, which corresponds to him being a male, while Einar, is a male who identifies as a woman (who is trapped inside).So, at first I did not really have an issue with Redmayne portraying this character. However, I thought about how Asian characters are often played by Westerners, and that made me rethink my opinion. It would have been politically correct to have an actual transgender woman play the character, but having said that, Redmayne does a terrific job. To me anyway.His performance, is in one word, electrifying. The intense rawness of his character's emotions transcends the screen. Especially the way he moves his hands and positions his body to mimic that of other female characters gives me the chills. He has a wide smile which is sometimes awkward, but can also be quite charming. As the character of Lily becomes more confident, more of her personality comes out. Vikander as well, does great in her role. She embraced her character and it is through her that makes the film more emotional.The visuals, from the costumes and the color hints, all aided in creating this historic feel of the movie. Because of the nature of the characters' work, the film itself mirrored that and presented itself like paintings too. Costumes and make-up bring characters to life, and the great cinematography brings the narrative to life. Tom Hooper and Danny Cohen do a great job with both intimate close-ups, and wide landscape shots. Always knowing when to use one or the other.Though this is based on a true story, the romance drama may be a Hollywood addition. That I'm not too keen on. It seems as though Hollywood adds drama to everything, and that makes it a little repetitive and boring. A little more insight into the mind of Einar would have added more depth to the character and the film. Overall, an amazing film with great mise-en-scene, and electrifying portrayals by Redmayne and Vikander.",9,1,2,13 June 2016
Oldboy," Twisted story but with great acting and prop use
","The trailer is no indication of what you will sit through as the film plays. I was at the same time both deeply disturbed and a little intrigued to see how it would end. Safe to say, I was not at all prepared to spend my Friday night like that. I can't say much without giving away the surprising elements of the film, but if you are considering watching the film, just bear in mind that you will probably be traumatised.I think the reason why I reacted so strongly (and negatively) to this film, is because I have been brought up in a society which considers these topics taboo and cannot even think to imagine if this were to happen to me. So in a way, the film questions the conventions of society and challenges us by putting us outside our comfort zone (way outside). The acting is great as the actors/actresses fully embodied their characters. The interactions between Min-sik, Ji-tae and Hye-jeong went smoothly and is realistic to watch. Min-sik does his character justice as a tortured man with almost nothing left to lose. Ji-tae while still having the looks of an innocent young man delivers the emotions of a sadistic and somewhat mentally unstable character creatively. Hye- jeong too, plays her role as the innocent and oblivious damsel well. However, it seems like a waste to have her introduced as a strong independent woman at the beginning and then turn her into a shallow headed female who is basically useless. Going off that, this film is so obviously male centred, and females are only used for their bodies. The use of props though used mostly for violent acts, are very impactful. A hammer becomes part of Min-sik's signature, replaced teeth turns into a clue, photographs are used to reveal past events and gift boxes no longer connote something positive. The director and writers (based on comic) are quite ingenious in this way, and everything is displayed in a way that ties to the end. Still, I will not be watching this again or the Hollywood remake for that matter.",8,1,2,13 January 2016
The Secret in Their Eyes," Thrilling acting, cinematography and editing.
","The story is incredibly told with great editing, directing, cinematography and acting. Starting out like a normal crime film, the movie juxtaposes the present with those of the past, and along with Benjamin, the audience recounts the past through his memories. It gets more and more complex, as when a suspect is found, what seems to be the end turns out to be the beginning of a mystery. The film also displays the corruption within the legal system, and the battle between evil and good, with Benjamin being the embodiment of morality. The acting as well is great. The connection and chemistry between both Darin and Villamil, and Darin and Francella is sweet. The film aggravates the audience by showing that both Benjamin and Irene love each other, but nothing is done about it. Similarly, there is a bromance between Benjamin and Sandoval that is touching, but heartbreaking when the relationship is broken. Rago and Godino both do a great job at showcasing their characters emotions and expressions. What really stood out for me is the cinematography and editing. The camera moves with such fluidity across spaces that it often makes me wonder how they did it. For instance, there is a scene in a football stadium and in one continuous shot, the camera goes from a birds eye view to a close up of the characters in the stadium. I am thinking that perhaps they used a drone which is pretty impressive. Similarly, the camera work in chase scenes are just incredible, everything form the shot placement to the composition and movement. Additionally, the editing is on par with the cinematography. There are multiple scenes that do not depict what actually took place but is more of a 'preview' into other possibilities of the story. I found this to be very impactful as it disorients you and makes you think about the story more closely. It could be confusing at times though, so it is both a positive and a negative for me.Overall a phenomenal film that tells an incredible story with great acting, cinematography and editing. Only thing is that it is a bit slow at times, but the ending is just chilling. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,3,3,12 November 2015
Billy Elliot," A moving story with pretty good acting and great chemistry.
","The character development and Bell's acting were really superb. The film was well made and edited as it perfectly captured the struggles that Billy face and takes the audience along on the ride that is his life. Bell too, accurately showed his character's frustrations and inability to stop dancing as the passion burned in him.The acting from the other actors and actresses were pretty good, though I would have to say not on par with Bell's. They got into their characters well enough, however it felt awkward at times, especially when Lewis as Elliot's father was trying to act really angry, it felt staged to me.The chemistry between the actors felt really real. Elliot's friendship with Michael was so sweet that I almost died inside. Elliot's relationship with the rest of the characters too, was well displayed.The dancing element to this was really cool; Bell can really dance. I liked that the dancing was incorporated into all kinds of scenes as it enhanced the different moods being displayed. The ending though did not have a lot of dancing, was a great way to end.I also loved the fact that the film is based on how boys should not do 'girly' stuff like ballet, and instead should do 'manly' stuff like football and whatnot. Take those gender stereotypes and gender intensification, and stuff it somewhere else.One down side to this story though, was that I did not really get what was happening in the community except that there was a strike. I was a bit unsure as to what the father and brother were doing, and why they didn't really get along with Billy. That was a bit shaky to me.Read more of my reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,0,30 September 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Shallow story with average acting and effects.
","I found this story to be pretty shallow as things just seemed to happen without explanation. The beginning scene just jumps right into it with no context given. Things happened very sequentially and it was continuous but so much so that it felt mechanic. The film was also predictable and presented a little statically. I'm not saying the whole film was awful, some scenes were OK, but overall I wasn't feeling it. The acting is average. I know Wolverine is supposed to be this kind of stoic person- so props to Jackman for keeping his character consistent throughout all these years, but that also makes him hard to relate to. Will.i.am does a decent job as does Collins, Schreiber, Huston and Reynolds (who does a much better Deadpool in the recent one). Personally, I felt that Taylor Kitsch's performance was the most engaging as his character is the most charismatic and with the most flare. Additionally, I did not feel the chemistry between the actors, and their dialogue felt awkward at times. The elderly Hudson couple (Julia Blake and Max Cullen) added an interesting alternative to the way Wolverine's life could have ended up. I liked the addition of the couple as it added something homely and civilized to the chaos of the film. That is probably why I did not like the film that much, because it had so much unnecessary and unexplained violence and aggression.The visual effects of the gore, and of certain landscapes as well are quite lacking. Numerous scenes are obviously filmed in front of a green screen which actually made me wonder how old the film was when I was watching it. Blood splatters too is very tomato-sauce like. Action scenes weren't too bad though, and stunts are well performed.",5,0,2,16 February 2016
Spotlight," A little disengaging
","Having watched this on a plane, and not fully finishing it (and missing some parts because I was nodding off), this review is based on my impression of the parts that I did watch. Based on a true story, Spotlight does well at giving a pragmatic account of what actually happened. I'm not very sure at which part I stopped watching (and which parts I missed) but from what I saw, the progression of the film seemed to take a while. Also, because it dealt with an industry I don't know much about, most of the technical talk went over my head.I mean it's great that they're bringing this story to light, but I was not following along that well. The cast did a good job at playing their characters though, and it was great to see A-list actors playing characters outside their typical roles. As well, the mise-en-scene did well in setting the atmosphere of the movie.",6,5,9,27 April 2016
Crash," Different lives intertwine in this brilliantly thought-provoking film.
","We are shown many different characters in LA and never seem to focus on one, but rather the whole film focuses on the diverse cast. What first seems to be a film about racial prejudice and discrimination further develops into how people can change, and that sometimes the people who overtly show discrimination might not be as dangerous as those who keep silent. There is a great cast in this who did an incredible job. But because there are so many main characters, we don't really get so in depth into their characters, that I honestly don't even know their character's names. However, we see enough of them to get a basic snapshot of their character and this is enough to gain our sympathy when something happens to them.There was this tone that was consistent throughout this film which was established right from the start. This tone had me expecting a really surprising ending or something of that sort and though I did get surprised, I think I was more confused. And though I got what this film was about after thinking about it for awhile, it just feels like it fell short of what it had me expecting.Or maybe it's because that there are a few characters who I don't know what happens to. The characters are split into two groups, those who redeem themselves and those who cross over and does something we wouldn't suspect of them. We are shown a few examples of both but there are some characters who don't really fit into either categories so it has me wondering what their role in the film was. I understand that this film thrives on the different lives intertwining but I feel that a few less characters would have made it much better.The song 'In the Deep' by Bird York (Kathleen York), that is played near the end of the film is a kind of epilogue which fits the story perfectly. This film was really well written, acted and edited.My final thought is that I don't know if this film is just so brilliant that my brain can't register or whether I'm so confused as to what I just watched. So I'll take it as a confusingly brilliant film. OK wait, I've got the word for this now. It's a heavy drama. There we go. I think I've got a headache from thinking about this too much.Read more movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",8,1,2,11 October 2014
The Polar Express," Family fun Christmas film with exciting adventures.
","The animation is cool, and more cool because the images of the actors were incorporated to create the images of the characters. The effects complimented the animation well and really gave the impression of a polar world. Down to the colours and everything, the animation was well done. Perhaps though, the characters could have been given more facial expression. With the exception of Hanks, the rest of the characters didn't have their emotions portrayed very well.It was a little weird that they didn't really have names except for Billy, which makes me wonder why. A little random to name Billy when he is not even the protagonist. Also, I liked that they had a girl character portrayed as a leader. Two thumbs up for that!A fun film with lots of adventure that would keep both children and adults moderately engaged. I thought they would spend more time in the North Pole though, so was a bit disappointed to find out that the majority of the film is spent on the train.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,2,3,19 April 2015
Suicide Squad," Insanity
","The suicide squad has been around for a long time now, and it's great that they managed to create a movie with all these characters! While I do not follow the comics, I do watch some of the superhero series, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is, in my opinion, very stylish and so well put together.The best part of the movie for me was, hands down, Harley Quinn. There is a great cast in this, and I wouldn't have imagined that Margot Robbie could pull off such a perfect Harley. Her persona, and her delivery certainly embodies the character, and she did such a tremendous job. Leto as Joker as well, was magnificent. It must be something about the crazy factor that makes it so captivating. Other cast embodied their characters well too, though none stood out like Harley Quinn did for me. The other great thing about this film is how stylish it is. Visuals and editing are on point, and most importantly- the soundtrack adds so much personality to the film. Just by watching the trailer, you get a sense of the kind of cheekiness that is embedded into the atmosphere. Which I think is mostly due to the fact that the Joker and Harley are unpredictable. Anyway, there is great music that accompanies the movie and adds to its style.I've seen mixed reviews for the film, and admittedly, the story itself isn't very good. The hook for this movie though, is the all star cast portraying various big shot comic characters. I loved it, simply because it's a fun film with a bit of darkness, but in essence encompasses the DC world. I liked how other superheroes (Batman, and the Flash) would casually make appearances, and there would already be that sense of history present, like it is in the comics. So overall, not a great story, but a fantastic squad and a well made film.",8,0,1,18 February 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Super action packed with plots that keep you on the edge of your seat.
","The action in this movie was incredible. The camera moved a teeny bit too much, but other than that, the choreography was amazing. Seriously. I just watched Divergent last week and thought the moves there were amazing. It was, but the action here was way more impressive. Really well done. I actually really wanted to clap after one of the fight scenes. Visuals were amazing too.To top it off, the plot lines were pretty suspenseful. It wasn't so intense, but it was definitely engaging though I agree with some that there was a bit too much talking during the first half of the film. It was important information, but I feel like they could've cut down on some of it. I'm not sure what it is, but I don't quite feel the chemistry between the actors. And though I feel that the action scenes were better, I don't get the 'I LOVE IT' feeling that I did when I watched the first film. I do still love this film, but I don't feel as excited about it.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",9,0,1,16 June 2014
Doctor Strange," Mind-bending
","Benedict Cumberbatch is a great casting choice for Dr. Strange. While I had my doubts as to Cumberbatch's ability to play a 'superhero', his personality and character portrayal fits well into this persona. I do think this isn't a totally accurate representation of the Dr. Strange in the comics, but it is still a good one. McAdams does well in her supporting role, and I am glad they did not give her character a useless role. As well, Swinton is kick-ass as the Ancient One, and her calm demeanor completes her character.The only problem I have with the casting, is that it tries and fails to be diverse. There's Ejiofor, and Benedict Wong (who plays a character named Wong), and while it is great that these two are in the film, the 'organization' was in Nepal, and I saw no Nepalese characters with a role in the film. Swinton herself is a very white contrast to the supposedly Asian setting. Apart from that, the whole cast did their parts well, and helped to sell this fantasy world. A major aspect of this film are the creative and mind-bending visuals, producing such complex and intricate designs that are simply baffling. Before watching the film, I read some comments which encouraged watching the 3D/IMAX version of this film, and I gave in. I watched this in ordinary 3D, and while I can't be completely sure, I think it did add to the effect of visuals. There are many manipulations and distortions of reality that are better seen in 3D. Of course, I would have to watch this again in 2D to see if there really was much of a difference. I would not be at all surprised if Doctor Strange won awards for its visuals and design. The intricate details with vivid colors are really magnificent, and must have taken the visual team ages to complete. Not only that, but the film is heavily invested in visual effects (with the sorcery and what not), and this too is impressive. The story is presented well, and I liked how it started with the fantasy world, and then transitioned into Strange's 'ordinary' world. The action scenes between the 'real' and the 'fantasy' world complement each other nicely. I've noticed some of the supporting casts (who had no dialogue) are trained in martial arts, and so pretty much make up the stunt team. That's a good way to get fights in...to just have characters acting as muscle. Anyway, it was a fantastic watch, certain to bring you on a ride to fantasy land. The only complaints I have with the film is the not so diverse cast, and the fact that the almighty dark under-lord did not seem very scary. It was more comical, which I felt could have been made in a darker tone with a more serious ending. This ending was almost childlike - which would fit well in the cartoons like Justice League.Also, there are two end credits, so make sure you stay till the end if you want to catch it.",9,1,4,7 November 2016
Interstellar," Interesting story with intriguing plots and great acting.
","First off, this would've been a lot better if they had cut quite a lot of the first half of the film. It took too long to get going and I was ready to fall asleep — it didn't help that I was already tired to begin with. The beginning set my mood for most of the film and maybe I was sitting too close to the screen, but my head felt really heavy.The plots were really intriguing and I love the concept of travelling light years in space with relativity and all that stuff. I'm not a physics geek myself but I have read previous Orson Scott Card novels and I think it was the Ender's Game series that had that space travel. Anyway, it was pretty easy to keep along with the time travel and wasn't as complicated as I thought it might be.The acting was brilliant. I personally do not like McConaughey all that much but he was pretty good in this, though I had a hard time understanding his accent at first. Hathaway was good in her role too, though not really a significant presence. What stole the show for me was Mackenzie Foy. Moving away from being Renesmee in Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2, her role here is completely different and she was able to get into her character's shoes really well. The emotions she was able to convey of her character was very mature for her age. Chastain as the older version of Murph played her character well too.In addition, the visual effects were stunning and visually stimulating. It's not easy to make outer space look real, and invent realistic looking worlds at the same time. The worm hole was well crafted and the layout of the planets carefully planned. What I do not get is the 5th dimension stuff, though I liked the visuals. I just don't understand how it got there.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,3,11 November 2014
Ant-Man," Great visuals and acting, but awkward screenplay.
","After the slew of Marvel films, one comes to expect a certain level of standard. And while the CGI, costumes, effects and acting were all great, I have a real issue with the screenplay. My overall sense of the film is that it was rushed into production and made in a quick manner (perhaps they had to seeing as Captain America: Civil War was coming out). I am genuinely surprised that Paul Rudd could pull off being Ant- man. He was both charming and charismatic and managed to capture the essence of his character. Normally when I watch Paul Rudd movies, I tend to notice him as an actor and not the character, but in this film I totally regarded him as Scott Lang. Michael Pena's character is both hilarious and annoying at the same time. His jokes and speech delivery is something that I have not seen that often, and so made me laugh more than it bugged me. As well, the addition of Dastmalchian and T.I. helps to bring some comedy to the film. Evangeline Lilly does a good job with her character and what little she is given to work with. An obvious statement, but women characters need to be given more credit and in particular action instead of keeping them on the sidelines and having them be controlled by men. Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll are both mediocre in their roles, as quite often their delivery and movements come off as mechanical. Going off that, I found the script to be very cliché and awkward. The dialogue just went from A to B, and though it could be an issue with delivery, I think it is more to do with the actual screenplay itself. Conversations were so one directional in that it was quite predictable what would happen. Also, what I mean by saying that the dialogue went from A to B, is that there was no build up or 'small talk' so to speak. It was all business, and did not feel natural. This didn't happen for the entire film, but it was noticeable enough for me to laugh out loud at how horrible some of the dialogue was. However, the visual effects were the highlight of the film. I'm not talking about the numerous explosions that seem necessary to any superhero film, but rather the combination of cinematography and CGI. The film displays beautiful shots that plays with levels of depth. Unfortunately, this feels more like an add-on and a side thought, as the shots last for less than a minute and there aren't many of them. One such shot can be seen in the trailer, when Ant- Man runs atop the barrel of a gun and the 'camera' pans to the right. I especially like how in that scene, the background is blurred and viewers are made to focus on the little figure. Also, I thought that the imaging of the ants was pretty cool. Though they do look robotic that might just be because I haven't really looked at ants up close much. Speaking of the ants, it was cool the way they collectively came together to build formations. In one scene on water, my friend commented that he actually saw ants do that before, and so it is great to know that the film-makers actually did some research into ant formations.",6,1,5,12 March 2016
The Italian Job," Great action, intricate plans and good acting.
","This film is really exciting and the plots are just so intricately thought out. What I really like about this film is how engaging it is, that it pulls you in by sheer force. From the beginning the film shows us how they pull off heists, and this sets the expectation for what this group can do. So while we are unsure of what they plan to do later on, we willingly follow knowing it will be great. Also, I think this was the film that made me appreciate mini coopers. The acting was great in this. Mark Wahlberg is a little mild, and does not really seem to be the robber type, but he played his part well. Charlize Theron did great too, unfortunately she is the only female in the film and so obviously is given the emotional role. Plus it was her father who died, so there is justification for her tears. But I must admit, her character was pretty tough and badass which I give props to. Jason Statham, Seth Green, Yasiin Bey and Edward Norton did their parts well too. Apart from minor background stories of the group and how they started their career, we do not see what motivates them to steal in the first place. When planning the revenge on Steve, the phrase 'it's not about the money' constantly comes up, so if money was not a big motivator for them, why did they become robbers in the first place? The rest of the film is motivated by revenge obviously, but without giving a reason for their start in crime, it depicts that these robbers aren't really robbers, since they are robbing from the biggest robber of them all. Also, Charlie is pretty much the only mastermind in the film which makes the rest of them there to provide muscle or just for comedic effect. Overall a really engaging and exciting film that did not exaggerate masculinity which I am grateful for. It would have been nice to have more than one female character though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,1,2,12 October 2015
The Matrix Revolutions," Good action like before, but with average acting and a mediocre ending.
","As with the prequel, the film does not repeat itself and the story progresses, but it's more or less the same thing. They fight, they talk, they get injured, and they fight some more. To be honest I'm a little disappointed by the way it turned out. The story is still interesting enough to hold your attention, and the action still engaging (though again, prolonged) but it doesn't really do anything for me. I'm following along, but I don't feel connected to the characters anymore.Keanu Reeves' character is pretty stoic and just so flat-toned, that to have most of the characters dependent on his character doesn't support the film enough. There are others, for example in Zion who fight the battle without really depending on Neo to save them, and that was a good addition. It was interesting to watch Gaye's and Watson's character develop and that was missing from the protagonist. Character development.The ending was pretty sad, but then again too easy. The thing is, movies only focus on 'the special one' and not on the previous failed versions. The film establishes that Neo is not the first, but we aren't given any credible information on to why the others failed and why stoic Neo is the special one â€“ apart from the fact that he can love. Oh, maybe that's why he's stoic, because he's more machine than human? Still, the series could have been better with more character development, and instead of the similar happenings whenever certain characters meet.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6,1,2,22 April 2015
The Revenant," Visual Masterpiece
","To be honest, I was not very interested in the film when I started watching it, and the trailer did not look all that engaging either. Though I do still think the first half of the film is a little boring, it was actually quite interesting. It depicts a different era, with a way of living that I am not much aware of, and so was quite an eye-opener. I just have to mention first of all, that the cinematography is absolutely phenomenal. Emmanuel Lubezki certainly knows how to position the camera, and along with Iñárritu's directing, manages to produce an exceptionally beautiful film. The shots of nature are so breathtaking that I feel like the film could have just been a documentary about the attractiveness of Canada (and Argentina). Indeed, during the first half of the film, it seemed like the appeal of the nature scenes far outweighed that of the narrative. The story is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, though of course through a Hollywood-ised version. (I spent a good amount of time reading through the trivia page on IMDb.) From what I gather, there is a lot more anger and confrontations with other groups in this film that was not experienced by the real Hugh Glass. Though I have been saying that the narrative was not engaging, it did get better as the film progressed. Do note that the film is primarily focused on the aesthetics and not the narrative. Speaking of aesthetics, I've already mentioned the amazing cinematography, but the visual effects are absolutely stunning as well. There is ton load of gruesome scenes and depictions of violence in this film, and they are all done with so much detail it's amazing. It is almost too hard to believe that what happens on screen didn't happen in real life. The bear attack -though seemed a little long, was absolutely chilling to watch. There is another scene involving another animal further on in the movie, and that too is unbelievably realistic. Adding to that, the make-up crew did a fantastic job at creating the wounds and scars. Seriously, everything that contributed to the visuals of this film supported each other into creating this visual masterpiece. Last of all, I am sure all of you know by now that Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Oscar for this film, and rightly so. Though it did not seem like much of a performance at first, I understand now why he won it for portraying this character. The sheer intensity of raw emotion that he manages to convey, transcends the screen and brings so much feeling into his role. I really applaud his dedication to acting (apparently he ate a raw bison liver even though he's vegetarian- check the trivia page). Additionally, Tom Hardy gives a great supporting performance. I did not even recognize him for some time, and was extremely shocked to realize that he was in the film. His accent sounds so natural, and leaves no trace of his British origins. Gleeson is believable as the Captain, and I was surprised to see him in this as well, since he is mostly in romantic films. It was pleasant to see some of these major movie stars in roles not normally their style. Overall, a visual masterpiece with amazing acting. The narrative was intriguing at best, and did feel convenient at times. Plus, the beginning was confusing, and I would have liked more of a background into Glass' life prior to the exhibition.",9,1,2,30 March 2016
Hugo," A magical film that appeals to all ages.
","The atmosphere of the film reminded me very much of that of The Polar Express. I don't know why seeing as I haven't watched that film in probably a decade, but it had a very mystical and magical feel to it. A film about dreams that seemed very dreamlike itself. It was well edited and the effects were fantastical. It was set in the early 20th century and had the feel of it.The actors were brilliant as well. Asa Butterfield, even at that young age was incredible. He was in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and more recently, Ender's Game. His striking blue eyes really helped convey the emotions of his character well in this film. There are so many rising child actors; where do they get all their talent from?! Chloe Grace as well. I had trouble placing where I'd seen her from until I went on to IMDb to check. I couldn't recognize her without her Hit Girl costume. Plus her character was the total opposite, I guess my brain couldn't connect the dots. That translates to great acting.I really loved the part where Hugo says: 'I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason too.' Genius.I don't really have any criticism for this film. Though I think they could've played more with the mechanical man. It was such a big part of the film and is basically what the film is centred on, but it doesn't really do much. After it was fixed, we still see it, but the focus is no longer on it. The focus of the film went from Hugo, the automaton, Georges and finally Isabelle. Not really sure if I liked the many transitions. I understand that the automaton was a symbol but I would've liked to learn more about it.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",9,0,1,16 June 2014
Divergent," Action packed, intense and suspenseful.
","It was a really well made movie and the action scenes were well executed. I missed a bit of the beginning of the film, so was a bit confused throughout but I get it now. It's a pretty good storyline. Actually, it's quite brilliant really. So simple, yet so captivating.The visuals were really stimulating and detailed, which made it really believable. Some elements reminded me of 'inception' as well. Just in the way it was edited and contrasted.But the thing with these stories (Divergent and Hunger Games) is that they all question the leaders of the society or the way that society works. I don't know if they're trying to get more people aware of the power that leaders abuse and to take action against it, but I think because it is set in the future, people might not think of it in the present. I mean, there are already a lot of people aware of the power that leaders abuse- especially if you turn on the news and hear about the rioting and civil wars going on in parts of the world (Syria, Venezuela etc), but because we all live in our own little bubble, we don't think it concerns us. So maybe these novels/films are trying to reach out to the younger population and to make them think about these issues and if that's the case, that's totally awesome but it doesn't necessarily make them think of the NOW.Right.Moving on, I'm a huge Maggie Q fan (Nikita FTW), so was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of her. She could've done a lot of action scenes as well, maybe in the future films! *Crosses fingers* Not even sure if her character lives beyond the first book though, but I'm praying so hard that she does. I'll read the books soon.Also, I kind of hate the fact that though we have this powerful female protagonist, she is still mostly portrayed as the damsel in distress and needs the guy to save her. I guess they were trying to establish the 'chemistry' between them, but I found those scenes to be a bit awkward and unnecessary. Oh well, at least this passes the Bechdel test.Wait- I just thought of this one example (which was evident in Twilight as well) that really is extremely problematic. The guy goes 'if I wanted to hurt you, I would already have' or something like that. I've never noticed this before but thanks to my gender studies class, I realize how pro-abusive these kinds of statements are. Think about it for a second. The guy is asserting his dominance, saying I have the power to hurt you, but I choose not to.Please. I could kick you in the balls but I choose not to. Whatdya think of that?And the fact that the cast was predominantly white. Not hating on this film, just pointing out the obvious that most often flies over our heads.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",9,0,1,16 June 2014
Bad Teacher," Shallow story but good acting.
","This film is not so much about the story as it is about the comedy. The title itself eludes to the comedy, which can be said to be bad. However this 'bad comedy' is what makes it funny.The story is not that interesting as it does get boring at times but it is not repetitive. The main focus is on Elizabeth and Diaz does a good job acting. You might not think her acting is good, but based on previous movies she has done I would say that this is not the type of character she is used to. Therefore I would say that she did a good job in this film as a badass foul mouth teacher. She delivered her lines convincingly and really fit into her character's shoes well. Punch does a good job of playing the uptight rule- abider, goody two shoes. I don't quite know why but it was either Timberlake himself or his character that really irked me. My friends and I were just fascinated at the possibility that Smith was probably the voice of Sadness in Inside Out (she is!).There is not much to say of this film, except that it mainly plays off Elizabeth's appalling language (especially around children) to produce laughter. There is also quite a few scenes that I find a bit crude or stupid, but that just adds to the type of comedy this film promotes. Additionally, there are some pretty predictable plot lines and endings but all in all, it was not such a terrible experience.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6,4,8,17 September 2015
The Exorcist," Good effects, mood, and general acting.
","I hate horror films. I don't generally get scared that easily, and true enough I did not think The Exorcist was scary while watching it, but when you're alone at night in the dark trying to sleep, it's a whole different story. I had to sleep with a light on the first night after watching this, because all I think about when I try not to think about it is the film and the ugly demon's face and whatnot. Even now I'm dreading writing this review. But putting the horror aside, this film was very well made.The acting once I think about it, is actually really good. Ellen Burstyn as the mother has really great expressions and her reactions are on point. I'm not actually sure how Linda Blair as Regan acted as the demon, but if that was her then she did a really good job too. (I try not to stare at them ugly horror faces, but the expressions and actions did seem demonic) Karras was another main character in this and he played the part of a distraught son and priest really well, torn between his duty and the loss of someone he loved.The effects is also very good for its time. Made in the 70's, the shaking of the bed to the make-up and telekinesis of objects seemed pretty real. Except for the vomit which just looked like green goo from Nickelodeon.The mood of the whole film was also very well established with the beginning scene in Iraq/Israel? It laid the foundation for something ancient and kind of supernatural to come into the film. Also, Regan's room is constantly cold and getting colder, I read somewhere that there was actually a layer of frost in the room due to them filming in real conditions.And of course, let's talk about gender. The daughter has to be the one invaded because 'girls' are vulnerable and open to penetration, and to being invaded. The demon entering her body is, if you think about it, kind of like rape. And the mother is a single parent who can't do anything, and needs the help of men to save her daughter and her family.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,2,3,21 March 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Great visuals and ensemble of characters but plot was pretty average.
","Having only watched one of the previous X-Men films, I wasn't really expecting much. But after watching this, it rekindled the little kid in me that used to watch the animated X-Men shows on television. It was great to see all kinds of mutants (and actors/actresses) with different powers, even though I didn't know their background. Cool stuff. The visuals and effects were really well done. It seemed like a more mature film than I had imagined based on the previous films.The acting too was on point, everyone played their parts and got into their characters really well. At one point I even consciously acknowledged this when McAvoy as Xavier was concentrating really hard and you could see the vein on his forehead bulge out. The character developments was also well explored and it showed on screen. The character of Quicksilver was a really good addition. He added a comedic effect and the slow motion scenes were great and accurately complimented the character.However there are quite a few things I have a problem with, mainly with the plot. It seemed a bit too easy for Wolverine to convince the younger Xavier and Magneto to believe him, when he didn't really do much himself. And why are Xavier and Magneto the only ones ageing? There's a strong difference between the characters from the past and present..hmm now that I think about it, it's probably because the rest of the mutants weren't in the present (with the exception of Wolverine who's immortal). OK like I said, I didn't watch the other films. I'm wanting to now though.Anyway, it was a really cool film, with cool characters and a kind of cool plot. It's just that it kind of made everything seem...redundant. If you've watched it, you'll get what I mean.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,1,1,5 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Great acting and visuals with a pretty well developed narrative
","The movie dives right into action which sets the drive of the entire film. It is action packed and there is never a dull moment. As well, the movie is a cohesive whole and is very well made. Usually with these many characters and A-list actors, there is unequal screen time between each, and the narrative of each character is separate from each other. An example would be to compare this to Batman v Superman. Even with just two characters the narratives could not interweave, and were very distinct from the other.In Captain America: Civil War, even though the overall narrative mainly focuses on the dispute between Iron Man and Captain America, the rest of the cast isn't left out. Everyone gets screen time and though some inevitably get more than others, it isn't noticed much in the context of the film. So much like how the narrative is about team segregation, the film itself did very well in creating a cohesive, well-rounded portrayal of all characters.This is also probably because most of the actors and actresses are reprising their roles and know their characters inside out. Thus, the acting and chemistry between them aided in creating this cohesive unit of the film. Everyone played their parts well and I was completely absorbed into the world of the movie.The action scenes and visual effects are great once again. Marvel films have established that they know how to create visually stunning action effects. The action too shows some impressive fighting scenes. Both Black Widow and Sharon Carter display kick-ass moves.Overall, this film is greatly entertaining and the narrative well established. The appearance of Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a bit sudden and random, but in the overall context is a good addition and necessary to the plot.",9,7,13,4 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastical enough
","A fun, fantastical film that extends the universe of Harry Potter. With the screenplay written by J.K. Rowling herself, you can expect some 'Harry Potter' talk in the film. Honestly, being someone who isn't educated with the world of Harry Potter, some terminology did get lost on me. There are too many creatures with names that you can't really follow which they are referring to. In regards to the cast, I do have some doubts. While I agree that Redmayne has the ability and look to fit his character, I think his role in The Danish Girl may have affected his acting here. His tendency to bow his head, and tilt it to the side is characteristic of his previous role, and is out of place in his character as Newt. A bit more charisma from him as the protagonist could have helped the flow of the movie. Farrell, and Waterston did their roles well enough, and while Morton portrays a typical character, she was likable. Another likable character is played by Fogler. His role as Kowalski is pretty much to provide the laughs, and he is easily the best character in the film. I was quite surprised to find out that Miller was the actor behind Credence, as I did not recognize him. He did extremely well in his role of a disturbed child seeking guidance. The emotions he portrays are intense, and fit that of his character perfectly. Visuals play a major element in this film, and the creatures are all agreeably detailed. Some are anthropomorphized (given human attributes), while others are more animal like. Either way, the detail is impressive, and you can tell from the overall shape what type of animal inspired the different creatures. The wizardry effects of magic are also well done. It is nice that the filmmakers included mundane uses for magic (like housework), and not just that for fighting. All the fancy light effects add to the overall theme of the film, and bring color to certain dark settings. I also noticed the soundtrack at certain points - especially during comedic scenes. The background music during these scenes are quite amusing, and definitely exemplifies the atmosphere. Overall, a funny and magical enough film.",7,0,2,28 November 2016
Spirited Away," Don't know how many times I've watched this, but it never gets old.
","This film is so cinematic with impressive visuals; as expected of any film from Ghibli studios. And though confirmation of any sequel to Spirited Away has burned to the ground now that Hayao Miyazaki has retired, my hopes will still live on. Together Ghilbli studios and Hayao Miyazaki have dominated the anime world. I don't know how they come up with these stories, and I probably don't understand all of what it represents, but maybe that's why I can watch it repeatedly. I learn something new or notice something different every time I watch it.Just amazing. It's heartbreaking, adorable, comedic, intriguing and visually aesthetic all in one. I find no fault in this. So if you have any qualms about this film, I don't want to hear them. Peace.BEST ANIME FILM EVER.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",10,1,2,16 June 2014
Inside Out," Cool concept and animation with interesting characters.
","Based on all the hype I was expecting this film to be more than it was. It was still pretty good, but not something I would want to watch again - as a few of my friends said they would (and one did).The animation is very descriptive, colourful and cute. The shapes of the emotions and their colours are very typical of what we may attribute them to look. I'm a little confused at what 'gender' they might be and why it differs, because in the mother's head they are all female and pretty much look the same. I'm not sure about the father, but they might have all been male too, but don't look the same, rather are the same shape and pretty much the same look as the ones in Riley's head. Perhaps this is alluding to the idea that puberty/growing up changes the emotions in our heads, which make sense.The voice actors were pretty good, they match the feel of their characters really well and nothing seemed out of place. Richard Kind, who plays Bing Bong is a small treat and his creation is something that I think most everyone can relate to.I feel like I have outgrown most animation films, as I have been saying for awhile now. Some I can find quite enjoyable and love them to bits (Despicable Me, Tangled), but others though are enjoyable to watch I don't have much of an affinity for.There was a short film at the beginning before Inside Out started, and I was not really impressed by it. It doesn't seem to serve any purpose, was pretty cheesy, and more obviously geared towards children. I was very glad that was not part of the movie.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,5,25,7 July 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Great acting that brought the depth of the characters out.
","I think this is the first time in history where I have liked the film better than the book. With all the hype surrounding the book and everyone who read it saying that they cried and loved the book to death, I just didn't see what it was all about. Sure it's a sad story and all, but it didn't make me cry and I didn't get it. However, watching it on screen made a significant difference.The cast I feel, was absolutely a perfect match for the characters, and the acting was superb. The chemistry between everyone was just spot on. Maybe that's why it did even more justice to the book. I feel that that's the way film adaptations of books should be; to bring the characters to life so that readers/the audience gets an insight to the characters which will have a stronger impact. However, I feel that this will be one a in a million.The film followed very closely to the book, but I feel that they made Gus the main witty person. In the book Hazel was equally as witty and the banter between them was what kept the dialogue fresh.And it's not really a problem I have, but more of a questionwhy would the parents let her drive? I mean, I guess it's OK for people with cancer to drive as long as they're not in a critical stage, but she has problems BREATHING. Isn't that incredibly risky? She already has cancer why do they want to risk her dying earlier due to a car accident? I'm thinking the answer to my question lies in the bookbut I can't remember. Maybe they just want her to do whatever and live the rest of her life happily. It just seems pretty risky to me.The ending for me, was really well done. It basically summarized what the whole story was about in one word. A very well made and edited film.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,1,20 July 2014
Non-Stop," A unique story that was thrilling and engaging.
","Not much was expected from a thriller on a plane (Snakes On a Plane come to mind anyone?) but this was surprisingly suspenseful and full of mystery. Marks (Liam Neeson) gets suspicious of everyone and the audience along with him. We do not understand the full situation and are kept along with Marks as he progresses through different situations.The action scenes were really well planned and put together. It really was non-stop, and things just kept happening while the minds of the audience are reeling to find the culprit.The acting was also superb. Liam Neeson has a knack for action and thrillers. Though there was this one point around the climax where I thought he was overdoing it a bit, but I guess that might have just been his character as he gets more desperate to find the criminal. Julianne Moore was great as well, but I feel that her character was a bit shallow. Last but not least, Michelle Dockery was fantastic, (I am kind of biased towards her as I love Downton Abbey) her facial expressions and her delivery were just spot on.A few things I did not like: One, Liam Neeson's character seems to be able to defy the force of being sucked out of an aeroplane. Two, do air Marshalls not get checked?Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",8,1,2,8 August 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Interesting scenes with some that had me tearing up.
","As with almost all sequels, I feel that the first movie was better, though this was still good on its own. The visuals were stimulating and really cool, with the dragons flying against the beautiful backdrops.There were also quite a few scenes that were very touching and gave me the feels. I teared at least three times. I feel like I'm getting soft. I never used to cry at movies, even the really sad ones and then now I seem to be tearing up in every movie. Oh well.The story-line was pretty interesting and not all that predictable. Though I feel that the screenplay could've been better. It felt a bit awkward and dry sometimes. Or maybe it was because the speech was targeted towards children, so it seemed a bit stale.Toothless really steals the show. He's the main attraction and the facial expressions he makes are superb. The relationship between him and Hiccup is really well portrayed. I feel like a lot of animation movies that have animals as part of their main cast, make them out to be somewhat like dogs. For example in Tangled, the horse really acted like he was a dog, with the leg scratching and sitting. I guess that's what makes them adorable and relevant to us. Because we wouldn't understand what it's like to have a pet dragon, so if they acted more like dogs, we would feel that connection. I don't know, I just came up with that but it kind of makes sense, no?Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",8,4,10,11 July 2014
The Chorus," Inspiring
","Barratier does very well in balancing the comedic parts with the more serious tone in the film. The antics of the boys and their overall attitude towards any figure of authority seems to be quite characteristic of a boy's boarding school.The story is simplistic while also containing some surprising elements. It has a somewhat predictable story progression but not the ending I was expecting. Also, I did not expect how dark some of the children could be. Mondain, comes (I think) from a psychiatric or juvenile ward, and so his behaviour is wildly different. In contrast, Pépinot is a quiet and introverted young boy who is known as the cute one. Also, the chemistry between each of the actors is great, and the boys do a great job at playing boys. Though I am not used to the type of songs they sing, it is undeniably beautiful. I'm not sure about the other children, but Maunier can actually sing (and has pursued a music career since then) and so that was his real voice in the film. It is amazing how well he can sing from such a young age, and Jugnot is excellent at portraying his character's pride and amazement at discovering this hidden gem. His eyes are full of emotion when watching Maunier sing, and it transcends the scene, making the audience feel it too. Overall, an inspiring film about the hardships of boarding schools, and the prefect who brought music into the boys' lives.",7,0,0,27 February 2016
The Pianist," An incredible true story with amazing acting.
","There were some transitions throughout the film that were a bit too sudden and could probably have been fixed easily to provide a better flow. Regardless, this film was stellar. The story itself is very detailed and had lots of moments that make you jump or tense up from the suspense. But I think what really made this film fantastic, was how minimalist it was. Simplicity is best.The acting was superb. I think this was the first film where I noticed Brody, and his performance is top-notch. I heard he had to lose a lot of weight for the movie, and it really showed on screen. The surrounding cast also did well in showing the emotions of their characters.However it does seem to drag along at some parts. Though it was still engaging, they could have probably shortened it just a bit to make it more rounded. Or maybe it felt a bit draggy because he was hiding and so to that effect, the audience had to wait in hiding with him. In that sense, then the 'pauses' in the movie was a good addition.Also a good addition, though I have no liking for, were the gruesome scenes of violence. They were really vivid and was made even more prominent with the plain view of bodies everywhere. The juxtaposition of human compassion, cruelty, kindness and killing was well done.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,0,30 November 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A silly movie, but with great acting, cinematography and screenplay.
","This film is perfect for a Friday night laugh. Its comedic element is at times so random but so funny that you can't help but just laugh out loud. It is silly without being overly stupid and it still manages to keep the story going. There are quite a few plots in this as the events just keep coming and the ball keeps rolling.The acting is phenomenal. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori make an unusual pairing but the chemistry between them and their conversations with each other is flawless. They portray their characters incredibly well as did Edward Norton and Saoirse Ronan. Adrien Brody did an all right job, though he seemed a bit over the top or maybe I'm just not used to seeing him in this sort of character. He was still pretty funny. Willem Dafoe's stone face is a weird mix between comedy and thriller.One thing I noticed is that apart from one or two characters, the whole film consists of mainly stock characters. I'm referring to characters who are only one dimensional and only show one side of themselves. I don't know if this is genius but to pull off a film and have it succeed without any character development is amazing. However, because the character's all have a place and fit so well with/ against each other, it works to its advantage. Though these characters are not complicated, it must have took a lot of planning to come up with them and arrange their relationships with each other.The cinematography is great and the artificial colouring adds to its comedic effect. Because it is so obviously fake sometimes, it just adds to the mood. Even the poster and images of the hotel seem to be two-dimensional, like a setting for a play or puppet show. Which is why I found it a little disconcerting when dark elements were introduced in this film (deaths and so on), it was too gruesome an aspect next to this comedic set up.I also did enjoy the screenplay, Gustave is such a very charismatic character and Fiennes plays him so perfectly. The way that the conversations go so fast makes the audience stay focused on what is happening and it doesn't give a moment's rest. The unnecessary swearing, I admit was funny, but luckily there wasn't too much of that.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,2,4,14 February 2015
City of God," Great acting, story, and cinematography.
","Based on a true favela (slum) named 'City of God' in Rio, the film does a great job at creating a realistic looking depiction of the life there. A little trivia: The location in which they filmed at was a neighbouring favela, as the actual favela was too dangerous to film in. Another trivia: Filmmakers actually recruited children from the favela to produce an authentic feel for the movie. Based on this fact, it is deeply disconcerting that these children are able to act out violet scenes so well, as if they already possessed the persona of their characters. The acting overall is very realistic, and the whole cast does a fantastic job, probably because they have been exposed to this reality all their life.The story was set in a unique way, with many flashbacks and initial introductions. That slightly annoyed me, when they would introduce a new character and then say that it wasn't time for his story yet. But it was interesting to have so many characters in the film, as it was used in a way to cover more aspects of the favelas. The introduction of so many characters and how they changed could also be a way to generalize these characters, as a way of saying that these characters can be found in any slum (Felicia Chan, and Valentina Vitali). However because Rocket is the narrator, it does come into question how he gains knowledge of the events that unfold to these characters when he isn't present.The cinematography and editing does well to complement the authenticity of the film. With its fast pace and well planned shots, the film right from the beginning establishes the action, fear and danger of what is to come. The explicit brutality of violence is not hidden and for this film and what they wanted to depict, it is probably necessary. However, I am not sure if is accurate in its representation of violence and the drug circle as it does seem excessive. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,1,3,1 November 2015
Gone Girl," A very intriguing plot with superb acting and editing.
","Even by watching the trailer you get a sense of suspense and this can be felt throughout the whole film. It was brilliantly made and edited. One thing I did not like though, was the numerous black screens. Probably it added to the atmosphere of the film but the cut-offs really bothered me. Also from the trailer, you get a sense of intrigue and want to find out more. Let me warn you, the reviews might tell you that this is not a normal film, but it will far exceed your expectations. This was crazy.I'm not even sure if I liked it all that much, and might be a bit mind-blown at the moment, but I do have to admit regardless that this film was incredible. The way it managed to manipulate the audience's views and feelings at times was exquisite. Not many films are able to do that. Plus it's such a (I was going to say psychotic which wasn't what I was going for, but somehow fits the film) psychological film. I've always wanted to watch more of those, for example Inception, Now You See Me, which are both favourites of mine. But this was almost too psychological. Too much so that after the film everyone in the cinema was silent. Take it as a good or bad sign but it certainly was an accomplishment.The acting as well was superb. Ben Affleck played his part really well making the audience wonder if he really did kill his wife or believe that he did not. But the real master in this was Rosamund Pike. It's really surprising how the trailer shows almost nothing of the movie, but that's a good thing. Anyway, Pike was beyond brilliant and I certainly will view her differently now. I would spoil it if I revealed more. Neil Patrick Harris was pretty creepy in this too though I don't know why. His character doesn't seem like such a bad person.One thing that I do have to say, is that they have a bit too much sex scenes going on. OK, I know I'm not a fan of R-rated stuff (violence, swearing, sexual scenes) but there was too much in this, and I'm not even sure if some were necessary. I admit one or two of them is crucial in telling the story and making more of an impact but do we really need so many?In conclusion, whenever I think of this film both my hands go up to the sides of my head and extend forward with my fingers spread in a gesture that implies being mind-blown.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,7,17,3 November 2014
Get Out," Eerie
","I am definitely not one for horror films, and if you take a look at my other reviews, there is only one other review that would fit the horror genre - The Exorcist. And I only have that because I was forced to watch it for a film studies class, which in hindsight, I may have been able to request to not watch it. Anyway, the reason I am saying this, is because I looked online beforehand to research extensively, how much horror this movie contained. I read a review that said it was more thriller than horror, and the person wrote in detail the parts which would frighten. It wasn't much of a spoiler for me, because I usually don't remember the things I've read or seen when watching a movie. Anyway, I decided to trust this person, because they sounded quite honest. And it was worth it. For anyone out there who cannot stand horror movies, I am with you, and this film is OK to watch. There are a few scenes that initiate jolts - and this is mainly accompanied with loud sound effects. But for the most part, these scenes are quite troll like, in the sense that Peele wanted visceral reactions (as heard in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel), and inserted these loud, abrupt sound effects in order to achieve that.What I can't stand about horror movies, is mainly the horrific make- up/ costumes, and of course, the eerie soundtrack which no horror movie is complete without. But for this movie, it focuses more on the story, rather than the actual scaring part, and so I would say they wrongly categorized it, as it is more thriller than horror.Moving on, Kaluuya puts on an amazing performance. I previous saw him in an episode of Black Mirror, and have to say that he is really talented. His expressions in Get Out, and especially the iconic 'sink' scene (which can be seen in the trailer), is phenomenal. Williams too, does a great job, and their chemistry on screen is well established. I would have to say that Gabriel was another actress of which the film would be incomplete without. Her emotionless stares are super bizarre, but is what makes her character. Howery, plays the comic relief for this film, and his personality really shines through. His character helps the movie stay above the line into total darkness.However, the ending pushed it over the edge into ridiculousness. It was bordering between being realistic but freaky, and sci-fi comedy throughout the film, but the ending just pushed it all the way into the sci-fi comedy realm. I'm not saying that the genre is bad, but it was so good at giving that thrilling atmosphere, until it just gave it away. So, in general, I'd say that this is a great thriller, with amazing acting, directing, and cinematography, but a poor ending.",8,14,31,22 April 2017
The Theory of Everything," Portrayed and told brilliantly.
","The acting was just sensational. Eddie Redmayne encompasses the character of Stephen Hawking so well, that I almost came to believe that Hawking himself was in the film. His slight facial expressions down to his minor feet movements were just so detailed and done with so much care and precision that I cannot give him enough credit. Felicity Jones as well, played her part really well and you could really feel her love emitting from her. The chemistry between them was just too good; it was heartbreaking to watch. This may be the best love story ever portrayed.Not knowing much of Hawking's life myself, I'm not sure how credible this film is, but Hawking himself seems to be satisfied that it mainly depicts the truth. It didn't really seem like much drama was added to it to make the film more 'exciting', so I'm going to believe that most of what was shown is the truth. My interest has definitely been peaked after seeing this, and I definitely want to give a go at reading 'The Theory of Everything' as well as Jane Hawking's book 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen', which this film is based on.The cinematography was marvellous and I could really notice when great shots were taken. It added so much depth and feel to the film. Kudos to Marsh, this was brilliantly made.One thing I would've liked a bit more was probably to have more of an insight into Hawking's emotions. I got the feeling that the only one who was troubled was Jane, when obviously Hawking is the one with ALS and would've had emotional or psychological breakdowns as well. Or maybe it just wasn't known because he couldn't really speak, or that his coping skills are really top class as from what this film depicts, he has a humorous personality which might have helped him with the disease.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,0,1,6 December 2014
Good Will Hunting," Genuine
","Knowing Damon mostly from his tough guy roles like The Departed, and The Bourne Series, I was surprised by his acting in Good Will Hunting, especially because he was so young then. But taking a look at the list of movies he has done now, I have to admit that he is one hell of an actor. He has done so many different roles - which shows his capability and proves his talent. Affleck doesn't have much screen-time in this, but plays his character well enough, as did his brother Casey Affleck, and Hauser. Williams will be missed for making these tear jerking moments, as he is able to portray empathetic characters so well. The film felt very genuine, mostly because it was unfiltered, and dealt with emotions from the perspectives of different people. Damon and Affleck really did quite a good job with writing the narrative, and Gus Van Sant in directing it. However, there are certain scenes where the monologues are just too long. For example, Sean had one when he and Will were sitting on a park bench after their first meeting. He just went on and on, and the close-ups too are a little unnerving. Then there was another monologue by Will while he was sitting in Sean's office, and kind of went off on a tangent to the point where I realized I had lost track of what he was saying. Also, I could have done without the slow-motion fighting scenes. Whenever there was a cut, you could tell it is obviously choreographed, and that they were moving in slow-motion themselves. That along with the frequent close-ups took me out of the narrative. Overall, a great watch with a complicated protagonist who has many levels to him. The cast is great, and the cinematography, for the most part, intriguing. The language may be hard to understand though, and the vulgarity is certainly off-putting, but adds to the characters.

X-Men: Apocalypse," Engaging
","The story doesn't really seem to have continued from the previous instalment, but that is how X-Men is able to entice both old and new audiences. Each X-Men movie has new characters introduced while still having the core characters at it's centre. The acting is great, as returning actors and actresses have already established their characters and know how to portray them. Those new to the franchise also do well and it's quite refreshing to see young faces portraying characters already established in the universe. Quicksilver's unique character personality really shines through, and is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Not only does Peters do a great job with expressing his character, but the visual effects, editing and directing, all played a part in creating this and the rest of the personas.Speaking of visual effects, the action is very well done, and the effects for the superpowers are exciting to watch. The vibrant colours as well, add to the immersive feel of the movie. Having said all that, while it was cool to watch, it wasn't as exciting as the previous X-Men film. It was still interesting and I enjoyed watching it, but it seemed more like it was setting up for more things to come. It felt like it was lacking something, which I can't really pinpoint what exactly. The screenplay is well written and has many comedic lines which add character to the film. But the constant switching between good and evil was a little tiresome and predictable to me.",7,2,5,22 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Great effects, character developments and storytelling.
","This film was pretty amazing. The action scenes did not have many kick- ass choreography, but that's because Spider-Man mainly uses strategies and shoots webs to fight his opponent. That was still pretty cool. The slow-motion scenes were a good addition too.I feel that the characters matured a lot from the first film, and that the actors/actresses grew more comfortable playing them. Spider-man (like Superman) is one of those heroes where their stories are mostly based on them juggling being a hero as well as a boyfriend, and this conflict was portrayed well by Garfield and Stone.Garfield's Spider-Man is known for being witty and making comedic remarks in the face of seriousness. His humour really adds to the character and makes him seem more human. Maybe that's why he wasn't included in The Avengers; because he's more human than the rest of them, and has had no proper training. Well, I hope they do include him in the next Avengers film, it would be so much more epic.One thing I did not quite like, was how there was more than one villain in this. It felt like it was building up to something with this one villain, and then a few others turn up. It just felt a bit rushed at the end. The other two villains had short screen times, but I guess they'll turn up in the third movie. But it also seemed so convenient that these villains would just appear. Like one bad encounter with Spider-Man and they would instantly turn into the bad guy. I don't know. Maybe that's how humans think, through recent events rather than the past.This film also showed quite a lot of background story and that helped me to understand more of what happened. That was a good touch. Many good touches in this film, and was pretty amazing overall. I cried twice throughout the movie. I don't know why, it's just the feels.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",9,12,29,16 June 2014
The Illusionist," Interesting story with good acting and costumes.
","My friend recommended this film to me saying it reminded him of Now You See Me, though I don't see much of a correlation except for the magical element. The story is not that focused on the magical element though that does play a big part in creating the illusion of the film.The acting is great, with the chemistry sizzling between Norton and Biel. Norton carries his character well and his charisma shines through the screen. Biel too does great in her role and with the costumes smoothly fits into that time era. What really shines as well is the acting by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Eleanor Tomlinson who play the young versions of Eisenheim and Sophie. The emotions they convey transcend the screen and feel pretty authentic.The setting of the film creates a nice atmosphere that complements the time period they are depicting. The colours have a very reminiscent feel to them with brownish and dark colours illustrating the past era. The costumes too are elegant and classy with long trench coats for the men and frilly dresses for the women- though the only female character in the film is pretty much Sophie. My goodness, I had a pretty big problem with that. Sophie was the only female character who was kind of like the other protagonist, but then she doesn't get much screen time. What. I was flipping out a little. Adding to that, I was a little peeved at the introduction of Asian characters who didn't speak and only served as muscle power.The story itself though is not entirely unpredictable, is still quite fascinating. However, I wished the film had shown more magical tricks, instead of focusing so much on the romance line. Also, the film cuts through the chronological order quite a bit which for the most part helped in creating the mystery of the story, but some bits were still a little confusing to match the events altogether. Overall though it was still a well made film with great acting and an interesting storyline.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,1,1,29 December 2015
Hidden Figures," Powerful
","Hidden Figures is an incredibly well shot, directed, and edited movie, with great cinematography, acting and soundtrack. It is always great to learn about names who helped to deliver outstanding human feats, and to recognize them for their contribution. Right from the beginning of the film, it establishes the tone of the movie, one in which people of color must be wary of authoritative figures. The opening scene set the theme of the film, and forebode the prejudice and discrimination these women would face throughout their career. I have to say, I am very impressed by this movie. The way in which it tells the story, and by the screenplay: self-deprecating and blunt, yet truthful, is very effective. The screenwriters did an excellent job at finding that balance between humor, passion, and suffering. I'd also like to note, that the story is based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly. Cinematography and directing are major contributors to the success of this film, with the use of well thought out shots to create maximum effect. The use of long shots are well positioned, and enhances the effect of individuals being empowered, or of isolation. For example, there's a shot where all the African-American computers are walking to another building, and the scene shows them walking into a hallway using a long shot from some distance away, depicting a sense of power in numbers. However, in another instance, Katherine has just had a door shut in her face, and when she turns around, a long shot is used to emphasize the empty space around her - this time, depicting desolation. The cast as well is simply amazing in the film, and pretty much everyone fully embraces their characters. Henson, Spencer, and Monae, depict an easy bond between their characters, and their banter is seemingly effortless. They deliver their lines with appropriate amounts of sass, wit, and intelligence in respect to each of their individual characters. Monae, in particular has a very strong headed character, and she pulls it off perfectly. Costner does well in his role as project leader too. However, Dunst and Parsons give more of an average performance. Dunst's accent is quite weird to hear, and Parsons might just be better of sticking with being a comedic physicist. Also, it would have been better if more information was given as to what these two characters actually did. They are in positions of relative power, but don't really seem to be doing much except sit around and give orders. I also have to say, that the soundtrack greatly complements the theme of the movie. Apparently, Pharrell Williams, a producer, oversaw all musical elements of the movie, including the soundtrack. Kudos to him, the music was enjoyable and added character to the scenes. One of the main things that may or may not be an issue, but which I consider important in noting, is that John Glenn, the astronaut, is seen and preserved as a hero. When he is introduced on screen, he shakes hands and chats with the three women - showing that he harbors no prejudice towards their gender or skin color. While this may have happened, I have an inkling that it probably didn't, and that Glenn would more than likely have had the same prejudices as the others. However, to preserve his hero status, filmmakers/ screenwriters made sure to keep him on the 'good' side.Overall though, a very powerfully themed movie with great acting, music, and cinematography.",9,2,9,15 January 2017
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Great cinematography, acting and editing.
","Having read the books quite a few years ago, I don't remember much of the details from there, but think this film greatly captures the essence of the book. It is of course, not an exact adaptation, however I did not feel that they missed much out that was crucial to the story. There are some discrepancies compared to the book though that I think are unnecessary changes. Just to note, this is the Swedish version that I watched, maybe I will watch the Hollywood one to see if it's better though I don't think it will be.The cast for this did a good job and was a really good fit for the characters they were portraying; with the exception of one actress that I felt did not fit into the image of her character. Nyqvist does well as Blomkvist, a confident kind of gentle person with attention to detail who had a pretty good upbringing. In contrast Rapace as Salander has had a much darker life and she portrays this perfectly. Her stoic expressions and speech delivery depicts how she has that emotional barrier and makes sure not to get attached to anyone.The story too is shrouded in darkness and reflects Salander's life. There is quite a bit of gruesome and grotesque images in the film, but fortunately it is easy to tell when it will appear so I can be prepared and avert my eyes. There is also some thriller action and the music score does well to match the mood of the scenes.This film also had great cinematography – especially with landscapes. Lots of beautiful shots and some great aerial perspectives.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,1,26 June 2015
Big Hero 6," A cool story with great animation and voice acting.
","Honestly, I put off watching this because I didn't feel like I would enjoy it so much. I was proved wrong. Right from the start, the fresh animation of this film along with the brilliant editing and voice acting had me engaged. Though the plot is pretty flat and for kids, the concept is pretty new (in that it hasn't been totally overdone), dealing in robotics which allowed them to show some cool stuff. But the story being from Disney, did have moments of it being 'too easy' as well as a few stock characters but it wasn't such a big deal. The story was told well, and wasn't cheesy or boring at all. The freshness of the voices and the animation really put this film together.The connection between the voices and animation really showed on screen the chemistry between the characters, and this worked to gain the sympathy of the viewer's at certain scenes. I thought that was well done, the characters were developed well in relation to each other. And I know I keep saying this, but I just really like the animation, and the effects. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind of Asian feel to them. It's also quite cool how the animated characters almost always resemble the actors voicing them (I guess this is intentional).However, watching the trailer again, I notice that they miss some of the scenes out. I mean if you put it in the trailer, you've got to put it in the film! I would've liked to have seen the scene with Baymax and the soccer ball.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,37,51,16 January 2015
Brave," A mystical feel with great animation.
","The trailer actually does an excellent job of not giving the real plot line away. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this and found it was not what I expected.The animation was really good, it set the atmosphere and was consistent throughout. However, I did not like the fact that the girls (Merida and the Queen) had to be so skinny while the men (especially the King) had to be huge. I guess during that time it was normal, but the contrast was too obvious, and just causes to strengthen gender stereotypes in children. What's the point of having the female protagonist rebel against tradition when she still has a stick figure that would get the little girls watching self conscious later on?I guess I'll have to complain on that point for just about every animation movie I watch. I don't think I've seen one without that body figure stereotype. If it's not the men being huge, then they're at least (almost) the same size as the women -- unrealistically skinny.Moving on, I originally thought Brave was about the princess going out and shooting arrows, and though she did, the movie wasn't entirely focused on it. I would have liked to see her shoot some more or maybe scenes of her learning to shoot.I did like the addition of the three brothers who added a comedic effect and were quite adorable. The film itself was well written and edited, which kept me interested along the way.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.",7,1,2,23 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Average plot but cool graphics.
","I've put off watching this film for so long despite all the good reviews, because the trailer honestly did not entice me. I do like Marvel films, but I'm not really into the aliens and galaxy thing (except for Thor), plus I had never heard of the comics before. I probably watched this trailer about 5 times in the past few year and still didn't watch the movie until now. Even while I was watching it, I was debating whether I should continue. Not to say that I'm glad I did, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.This film was pretty entertaining as I didn't realize time passing by while watching this. Chris Pratt is a very charismatic actor, and he was able to hold being the centre of the film well. The supporting cast was great too and Cooper did a great job lending his voice. It doesn't actually sound like him at all, but his voice matched that of his character really well.The story is pretty straightforward and kind of cliché. You have the average guy going about his business, and then stumbling upon something and getting into trouble. He makes friends along the way and at the end he grows to be a 'better' person. Also, it kind of feels like it's trying to be a comedy, but subtlety. Sometimes it even feels too casual and more of a comedy, but without actually being in the genre itself.The cinematics was cool though. Being in space and all, the layout of the planets and the graphics were pretty good. It looked really futuristic and from a totally different planet, so it did its job. The gadgets used were interesting too, however they didn't really explain how the major ones worked. During action scenes its pretty self-explanatory to see most of the gadgets in use, but when they needed to create a weapon from scratch to defeat whatever, it wasn't explained how it worked. It just 'magically' did.People have been saying that this film has the best soundtrack but I disagree. Sure, there are a few great songs in here, but they're only played for a few seconds (OK maybe up to a minute) here and there, it's not enough to fully enjoy it. Plus it seems like it's just added in for the sake of it. It doesn't feel authentic to me.Also, there was this one character who appears for a few seconds in the beginning but then disappears from the rest of the movie. Where did she go? I'm not hating on this film, it's well made, but I just feel like its another ordinary movie.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,1,3,22 February 2015
The Imitation Game," A great story told through brilliant acting but a little confusing.
","Based on a true story, Turing is known as the man who broke the Engima code and saved years of more warfare. I hadn't known of his story and the connection he had with the war before, but I had heard of his name. So based on my limited knowledge, I found this movie quite interesting and compelling. With that said, I feel that the story was presented a little messily. It shows three points in time of Turing's life and though the one of his childhood is easily distinguishable as the past, I did not follow that they were showing two other points in his life; the time when he was working on the code, and the present. Perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention, but it really wasn't clear. This could also be because the British tend to have more subtle ways (for example in their humour), thus their films are more subtle as well.The acting was pretty brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch whom I know from Sherlock but have never actually seen the show, was tremendous. His character is somewhat devoid of sympathy, and Cumberbatch shows that well, but at times when his character gets really emotional, that was when he was best. It was completely riveting. Knightley, Goode and Strong were great too. Strong has a natural talent to play a character that you cannot trust (not that he did in this movie), but his face just gives off that vibe. The chemistry between the characters were solid too.Also, I did not really understand some parts of the film. The thing with the Enigma code and machine kind of flew past my head at times. It wasn't that confusing but at the point of Eureka!, they were moving too fast for me to catch on. In addition, the conflict between Turing and John did not go into much detail and kind of just left it hanging.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,2,5,4 January 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Great acting and cool effects but same old story.
","To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed in the film. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but the story was nothing new. You might argue that it's not much of the story that these comics/films are about, but rather the action and powers, but still, even in the comics there is progression and character development.The visual effects was great as usual, and the action scenes pretty exciting. However, it seemed like the majority of the film either involved fighting or talking and that was pretty repetitive. It got a little tiresome watching fights and explosions, plus this time there was no charismatic, fun Loki to keep the film centred around. The film just basically had the same hurdle the avengers had to get through, which was to work together as a team.Other than that, I liked how we had more of a glimpse into Hawkeye's life, as well as a more human view of Hulk and Black Widow. I was not expecting them to be inclined towards each other but it was cute.The script seemed a bit much though. There was quite a few funny moments but in all it seemed like the writers added too many lines for each character just for the sake of laughter. Too many one liners and there wasn't much conversation between the characters as well. This also made it seem like the avengers were not that serious about the end of the world.So in my opinion, the first avengers film was definitely much better. Though I still like this film, it didn't wow me, and it felt a little tiresome watching the fighting scenes again and again. Though I liked how a few of the other characters from their personal films appeared, and the addition of the Maximoff twins was interesting but could have been further explored.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7,6,14,4 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Cheery
","I remember enjoying it the first few times I watched it, but after this viewing I was a little indifferent to it. The acting, story, settings are all quite nice and well done, but it all seems too cheery for me. Everyone is too happy and cheerful- too artificial for me.The trio's performance (Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds) worked well cohesively, and the chemistry between them is solid. They portray their characters with enthusiasm and are very convincing. Hagen as Lina does a fantastic job, and her high-pitched voice gets me every time. The constant swapping between who is singing for whom makes for a fun trivia. The story is very self-reflective in that it shows how movies are made (while being a movie itself). It does a pretty good job at this, but of course only shows the workings of the top decision makers. Also, the self-reflectivity does not interfere with audience engagement as viewers are kept engaged by the romance line between Don and Kathy. As for the musical part, most of the song numbers are pretty entertaining and catchy, though some are a bit long. Also, there is one sequence which is set in the idea of a film Don has (a film within a film) that has no correlation to the narrative itself. So I did not really think that sequence was necessary, but I guess it served to further reinforce the American Dream ideology. The settings are quite vibrant in colour which is nice, but for me adds to this artificiality of the film. Everything is too neat, too clean and pristine. Adding to that, the sound though is synchronized pretty well, is sometimes obvious that it was recorded separately. Overall, a pretty fun film to watch, and which everyone should watch at least once.",8,0,1,11 February 2016
La La Land," Exquisite
","From watching the trailer, it gives off a very enthusiastic and fun mood, however, that may be slightly deceiving as the movie goes through a range of emotions. Some will be unexpected, and that is what makes this film so great. A must watch till the end, even though the beginning half may be a bit slow, it is worth it. If they had cut out some details or made the beginning half a little shorter, then it would have been perfect. The musical numbers are plenty, and all very well executed. I absolutely love the soundtrack. Here is a movie based entirely around the musical element, and it is phenomenal. As I write this now, I'm listening to the soundtrack. As all (or most I presume) of the songs are original, they are able to create the song to suit each character. Not only that, but choreography throughout is simply amazing. Those like the beginning scene is simply to initiate the audience as to what they are getting into. Others like the tap dancing scene with Gosling and Stone, are infused with feeling and flirtation. The cast is perfect. Gosling and Stone complement each other so well - they were previously paired in Crazy Stupid Love. Gosling is such a versatile actor; just looking at his IMDb history is so impressive. He can encompass a range of personas, and is great at portraying characters with a lot of passion. Stone is also quite a versatile actress, and it is hard not to like her. I heard from my friend that there area also quite a lot of distinguished dancers in the movie, and that doesn't surprise me. It is a musical after all, and that requires great dancers, not just great actors and actresses. So overall, everyone did their parts extremely well and was able to bring a lot of energy to the story. What makes this such a classic, is that it pays homage to many eras in the Hollywood film industry. There is a bit of film noir, quite a few scenes depicting the silent era, there is of course the sound era, and the introduction of technicolor, and what makes it so classical is the fact that it mimics the style of Singin' in the Rain. What with the musical numbers, and also the self-reflective aspect of the story. While in Singin', the characters were actually making a movie, in La La Land, they show some behind the scenes of how Hollywood is like. There is also quite a few instances where characters break the fourth wall, and this is done so smoothly that it doesn't really affect the diegesis. The ending scene as well, is very much like the one in Singin', though produces a different effect. Overall, this film is definitely a new classic, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Everyone I knew was saying how good it was, and I can't agree more.",9,0,4,10 February 2017
Life Is Beautiful," A comedic, solemn, tragic romance all in one film.
","I did feel really sad after the movie, but I feel like they made too much of a comedy out of this, so it wasn't as impactful as it could've been. Benigni does a really good job in his character, and the whole film basically rides on his shoulders. The rest of the cast weren't that important though they did play necessary roles.The first half of the film, we see Guido cruising along and winning people over with his humour and wit — which led me to believe that this film was something like a three idiots movie. However that was not the case, and maybe if they played down the comedic element just a bit, it would've been a lot more effective.During the second half, it was pretty heartbreaking to watch him interact with his son and being so cheerful while death and suffering surrounds them. But the Holocaust being a really serious topic, Guido felt just a bit too comfortable/ cheerful in the camp. I get that he was like that for the son, but if we just saw a little breakdown of his character or something like that, it would've added so much more depth to the film instead of his character being kind of two dimensional. Another thing is that he seems to move around freely and from my knowledge, that is not so easy in a concentration camp. Just a thought.Overall, this was a really great film with an emphasis on family, love and hope, and had great characters and actors to complement.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,1,2,29 November 2014
Snowden," Fifty-fifty
","Having little knowledge about the facts surrounding the Snowden controversy, this film does a good job at showing the rise and fall of Snowden. While I appreciate that the filmmakers made this film (I'm surprised there was no move to stop it from being made), it does incorporate an extensive amount of American propaganda.Gordon-Levitt does an absolutely amazing portrayal of Snowden. Not only does his look change (Gordon-Levitt as an actor vanishes as the movie goes on), but the way in which he trained himself to imitate Snowden's speech is incredible. While it isn't exactly 100% the same, it is quite close. Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend (this is a very man heavy film) is quite annoying. I don't mean Woodley herself, but the way her character is presented really set me off. Maybe the real Lindsay is like that, but the way the film made her out to be such a dumb blonde really peeved me. Even after first establishing that she knows a bit of code, and HTML, they just make her redundant, and solely an object of desire for the protagonist. Additionally, while I like how the film is organized in its storytelling, there was too much American propaganda added towards the end. After displaying all the outrageous things organizations are able to do with the click of a button, the movie doesn't hold them accountable. They aren't portrayed as the bad guys, even though they are saying that these organizations should not be crossing those lines. Instead, they are saying that this happens, and that the public should be aware about it. But, that they still love their country. Another thing that really made me question the credibility of the whole fiasco, was the ending scenes with the real Snowden just posing in front of the camera. For a long time. In different angles. Turns out he might be an attention seeker after all.",7,2,8,11 October 2016
Woman in Gold," Compelling portrayal of a true story.
","I have an affinity for historical stories, and the juxtaposition of the past and the present in this is something that was superbly done. The transitions between the two times seem so effortless and natural like the slow pan of a camera, and it wasn't disorienting at all.Irons and Maslany have great chemistry and did a great job acting wise. Mirren and Reynolds too did really well, but to be honest I don't really understand Reynolds' character much. His look and demeanour is sometimes that of a shy, awkward person, but he isn't really like that plus the fact that he's a lawyer makes it a little more confusing since lawyers are mostly the opposite. Or maybe it was Reynold's acting On the other hand Mirren gives an outstanding performance and accurately captures the emotions of her character that the audience cannot help but feel for her.The decorations and costumes – especially that of the past, was really intricate and detailed. A very artsy kind of atmosphere with many valued belongings, which makes me wonder what the father/ father's brother did for a living but we never really find out.Also, though the storyline is not complicated, I kind of lost track with the legal procedures for a little bit. They go through many sort of 'trials', but it got clearer as the film went on.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,0,23 June 2015
The Matrix Reloaded," Interesting progression, visually pleasing, action too much like a video game.
","The story was still pretty interesting, and builds on what happened in the first film, and not merely repeating instances of it. I have read reviews that talk about so many religious meanings to this film, but I have not read anywhere that it is actually based on any philosophical/biblical myths. I guess that is open to interpretation as the Wachowski duo excluded themselves from interviews and talking of the films, leaving the films to speak for itself.The action was all very well done again but at the same time felt pretty prolonged. For example Neo fights Agent Smith and the fight goes on and on and on. I really do not think it needed to be that long. Plus it was very video game like and that showed in the animation sequences of the action. The visual effects help it a lot as the whole film has this kind of virtual look and thus the animation stuff does not look so obvious.I am giving this film a pretty moderate rate, as I did not like some of the elements incorporated into this, especially that of the white patriarchal society. Basically, once you learn about how to see the underlying ideology in film, it is hard to find a film that does not conform to this ideology. Here are just some factors: A white man with all the power saves them, the female is asked to step out, the female needs saving, at the head of all this is a white man and so on. It is good that they have a lot of other ethnicities included in the film but their roles are very stereotypical; the Hispanic is a fortune teller, the Chinese are fighters or the brains and ultimately the white men are always the ones in charge.So as much as this film is enjoyable, and this series very intriguing, it has fallen from its initial attraction for me.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6,1,1,18 April 2015
A Beautiful Mind," Amazing portrayals, editing, cinematic style and chemistry
","This movie is just brilliant. The acting is brilliant. The portrayals of that period in time is brilliant. The directing is brilliant. It's brilliant. The movie may not be as accurate as the reality, but it displays the effects of schizophrenia on the mind and of those around in a way that is accessible to everyone. I would really like to read the biography of John Nash now.Russell Crowe does a fantastic job getting into his character, that he pretty much becomes John Nash. He is like Eddie Redmayne in Theory of Everything, or rather Eddie Redmayne is like Russel Crowe and Theory of Everything is like A Beautiful Mind of 2015. Jennifer Connelly (who seriously looks like Demi Moore) is great in this too. I won't get into how her character is entirely centred on being a care taker, but perhaps that's how it was. Anyway, her acting was great and the emotions she portrayed could be felt. The rest of the cast too were brilliant and you could really feel how in character they were.Ron Howard did a great job directing this to be a masterpiece. I would expect that it would be hard to connect with this kind of character and to keep the audience involved in the film, but Howard does it perfectly. Also, Crowe portrays Nash in a semi-charismatic and witty way and as the audience, we are just drawn to him. Great job on both their parts.The editing and make-up are pretty phenomenal too. The editing of time passing and cuts of scenes make the film engrossing to the viewer. The scenes during and after the revelation of his mental state mimic his inner turmoil as the mood of the film tones down from there to one that is more sober. The make-up is especially noticeable as the characters age and there is a dramatic difference between their appearances – in a good way. It's incredible how make- up can do wonders.I don't really find this a problem in the movie, but it did add and or change events from reality. For one instance the ending scene with the pens is not a custom at all, and the relationship between John and Alicia was much more rocky than was portrayed. As a portrayal of real life situations and people, I feel like they should have respected what happened instead of 'Hollywood-izing' it. I still love the movie though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,4,5,14 March 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Cool storyline, effects and great editing.
","The deja vu part wasn't as tiresome as I would've thought, and the juxtaposition of him dying and waking up again over and over was pretty funny. The film was well edited and the placement of the scenes complimented the story well. With some scenes having the audience in the loop and some without.The action and visual effects were good too. Though I would've have liked a bit more background on how the aliens came to be and why they were on Earth in general. The armour was a cool addition, however I saw them equipping handguns and pistols.which with the image of the armour looked pretty comedic.Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt acted really well in this film. Usually I feel like Cruise takes on very similar characters (and this one wasn't that different) but he did a good job here. Blunt played her character really well too, and was very fluid and consistent.However some parts with the aliens felt too unrealistic. It doesn't seem possible to outrun from the aliens as they move so quickly, and also I don't get the business of them suddenly appearing out of nowhere when there's a loud noise. If they were already close by wouldn't they have known without the help of loud noise? Also, the knowledge of the power was a bit iffy.Overall, this film was pretty interesting and had some cool actions and visuals to engage the audience.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,2,10 November 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Great songs, good acting and funny.
","Pitch Perfect has itself become a brand, and the way the film is made is just so unique and personalized. A perfect example is the beginning, even before the first scene when the 'Universal Pictures' logo comes out, instead of the normal sound effects that follow it, there is – surprise, surprise, an acapella arrangement of it. Sung by John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks) the infamous hosts, their harmonies are on point and is such a perfect introduction to the film.The opening scene right after is hilarious, and just puts the standard up there, setting the mood for the whole film to follow. I wouldn't say that this was on par with the first, but it was quite close. The jokes were pretty funny and quite a few had me clapping my hands and laughing quite loudly. However, some of the jokes though I know they are not serious, were either too random or too stereotypic or racist to be funny. One or two of those jokes taken in good light works well, but John has too many racist/sexist lines that it becomes tiresome after some time.The acting was great, Rebel Wilson really steals the show, and her character is just so charismatic that you can't help but be drawn to her. I wasn't really feeling Anna Kendrick's and Hailee Steinfeld's characters so much. Steinfeld plays Emily, and she joins them to compete in their international competition. Their acting was good, but their lines were a bit random and especially Steinfeld's felt quite off at times. Random shouting lines are not my thing, on top of the issue that her character pops in kind of randomly. I think the movie could have done well even without the addition of a new main character.The best part of the film though, would be the songs and the singing. Really well done, I love mashups and acapella, and the film does the arrangements superbly. Nice touch adding the choreography too, quite a lot of dancing in this and it looked cool.Read more movie reviews at: championnangels.wordpress.com",8,11,21,17 May 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Incredulous
","DiCaprio really embodied his character well, as he does with all his movies. He became Belfort so much so, that my friends and I were questioning if he was like that in real life. The rest of the cast too, did well in portraying their characters and displaying the kind of people who are in Wall Street. The chemistry they had with each other was good, and felt more like a club than a company. The film is quite explicit and both promotes the American dream and depicts women as objects. Perhaps as this is a biopic, it actually did happen, but I felt it was not at all necessary for the show to have nude women in it. And many instances of it too. Plus, the amount of sex scenes and orgies showed is probably the most I've seen in any movie. It does add to the understanding of the characteristic of the environment, and of Belfort's character, but I'm not so sure if multiple and frequent depictions were necessary (this could have also shortened the length of the film). Additionally, I was quite surprised to see the breaking of the fourth wall. It's intriguing to me that it did this so well. Apart from the first time it occurred, the other instances aren't as jarring, and managed to keep me invested in the story of the narrative. As well, it didn't feel awkward. This was perhaps because of the fast pace of the film. As in the Experimenter, the breaking of the fourth wall was very awkward and didn't feel right. Overall, I'm not exactly sure how true this film is in depicting the actual life events of Jordan Belfort, but it definitely gave it a worthy try. The directing and editing is well done in establishing this fast-paced life of the Wall Street wolf, and the actors did a great job at portraying their characters. However, the film was about an hour too long, and had too much nudity. It also seemed to be slightly portraying this lifestyle as glamorous.",7,1,2,16 April 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Let down
","I'm going to be honest, (not that I would be anything other than honest), the trailer is the best thing about this film. It shows all the best scenes, which depicts and deceives a different story. I would have definitely liked it more if the film was just about pets at home, rather than making it into an adventure. The pets, for the most part, have fun characters. Max and Gidget, are for sure my favorite two. Max is the ever loyal human's best friend, and Gidget has the most character out of all. Her persistence is admirable, and Slate does a great job with dialogue. On the other hand, the other group of pets - led by Snowball, was a bad choice for the film. When Snowball is introduced, it just brought the film down so much in my standards. I have nothing against Hart (he is a rather funny guy), but his voice and the character did not fit at all into the overall tone of the film. He is just so much more vulgar than a kids show should be, and his character was so obnoxious and loud, it made me cringe. The animation itself is vibrant and colorful, which fit well with the characters. The scene settings had great detail, and the characters' movements were smoothly done. Filmmakers definitely did their research (in which they may have just observed their pets), and it was great to see the little things that dogs and cats usually do. The way Max's ears droop is so cute, and how Chloe plays with the toys around her reminds me of my cat. It was also fun how they contrasted the attitudes between cats and dogs. As I said, the main issue I have with this film is the character of Snowball, and how typical the plot is. Everything else was enjoyable and cute to watch. It was just a disappointment to watch a film that promised to show what pets do at home when they're alone, but didn't deliver. Would have liked to see more of that, and more of the owners too.",6,0,1,22 December 2016
Finding Dory," Adorable enough
","After years of speculation and doubts about whether a sequel to Finding Nemo (2003) was coming to screens, Finding Dory finally emerged. While visuals are amazing, and the voice acting full of personality, the recurring theme of short-term memory loss got a tad annoying. DeGeneres carries the film, and her voice is very recognizable as Dory. She is definitely a perfect fit for the character. Having said that however, I sense that she 'babied' her voice a little too much. At times, it felt like too much effort went in to trying to make her voice sound more adorable. Adding to the fact that she says the same few lines about a hundred odd times in the film can be pretty tiring. Other voice actors did a good enough job with their characters too. Hank (Ed O'Neil) is very impressionable and provides some spy wannabe drama to the movie. Though she only had a few lines, the addition of Sigourney Weaver was a fantastic idea, and provided probably one of the best laughs for me. Animation is great, as expected. The colors are all very vibrant and aesthetically pleasing. The sea lions are fun to watch, and especially the quirky one, whose name I believe is Gerald. Becky is another such character, who like Gerald, doesn't have any lines, but provides much comic relief. While animation, and voice acting is done well, the characters are pretty much stock types, and reactions are often over exaggerated because it is a kid's film. As such, I found it somewhat enjoyable yet tiresome to watch.",7,1,7,31 July 2016
The Big Short," Astounding
","While the subject matter may be a bit dense and unappealing to most, this film does a magnificent job in dumbing it down for us regular folks. One of the unique ways in which they do this, is by bringing in well known stars (not only those in the film industry), to explain or demonstrate technical words and theories. Stars such as Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez, and Margot Robbie.Following the theme of breaking the diagesis of the story, and bringing in people unrelated to the narrative, the film breaks the fourth wall multiple times. Normally, this is unnerving and unwanted (as seen in Experimenter). However, it was done so effortlessly, and with so much charm, that it succeeds in this movie. This may be a trend in documentaries, unless it is a tendency that has been around for awhile now, which I am just discovering. The Wolf of Wall Street also breaks the fourth wall smoothly, and perhaps it is the best - or only, way to truly explain real world applications. As for the portrayals, Gosling and Carell play similar characters they have done before (with a bit more exaggeration), but are nonetheless engaging. The two most surprising performances for me, came from superstars, Bale and Pitt. They looked completely different, and encompassed their characters wholeheartedly. Perhaps it is because that they are seasoned actors, which is why they are able to come off so completely as their characters. The screenplay, soundtrack and cinematography makes this a very stylish biopic. Though not as ostentatious a story as The Wolf, this brings us behind the scenes before the market crash, and depicts how fraudulent the system actually was - that it went on a further 2 years than it should have.Amazing storytelling and film-making, which manages to absorb the audience while still using financing jargon. The subtle comedy is injected parallel to the serious and dramatic undertone, creating a blend which will captivate viewers.",9,0,0,12 December 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Scratched surface
","While everyone was pretty much concerned about Affleck's performance as Batman, no-one really thought to wonder about how the story would turn out (well at least I didn't). All the marketing hype around the film got me super excited for it. However, I did not have that same sense of excitement while watching the film, which was a little disappointing. This is primarily because the movie incorporates so many big characters which resulted in numerous and repetitive jump cuts across the individual narratives. This resulted in multiple anti-climaxes as the scene would change just as it was starting to get interesting. Then when the narratives came together, it wasn't for very long.I am pleasantly surprised by Affleck's portrayal of Batman. He did a pretty good job and embodied the persona of Bruce Wayne well. Cavill reprises his role as Superman and does a consistent job since Man of Steel. Adams as well retains her character's persona well and her chemistry with Cavill is believable. Eisenberg shows off his acting talent ass Luthor, and his characteristic speech production fits the character well. Jeremy Irons who plays Alfred brings some comedic relief to the movie, but should have had more screen time. As well, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman deserved more action, plus there were some scenes about her past that seemed very cheesy. The visual effects and action scenes were nicely done. The atmosphere of the film throughout had a consistent intense and serious tone to it which was complemented by its dark setting. However, both Affleck and Cavill frequently had frowns on their faces which seemed too intense to me. I get that they have a lot of emotional baggage, but it went overboard. Also, too much masculine pride and ego going around. Use your words not fists, bro. Though the final battle at the end had great visual effects and was quite impressive. Overall, though I did feel like the film could have been polished better by creating a narrative that flowed, I am still somewhat impressed by it. Can't wait to see the Justice League films! But in general, I feel like DC should stick with TV shows, as Marvel is better at making movies.",7,2,4,28 March 2016
La Vie En Rose," Amazing acting, great design and directing.
","Cotillard does an incredible portrayal of Piaf, so much so that I did not even recognize her. Granted I have only seen her once or twice in a film (Inception being one of them) but the way she totally immersed herself into Piaf's character is just so amazingly well done. She definitely deserved that Oscar for best performance. Supporting actresses Testud and Seigner were also amazing in their characters and really added a realistic feel to the film. Basically all actors and actresses in this film helped to create its phenomenal experience of Piaf's life. Shout out to Jil Aigrot, who lent her voice as Piaf's singing voice -exquisite. The story is great though the non-linear narrative does jump around quite a bit. However, after investing more time in the film it soon becomes clear as to which point in time of Piaf's life the scenes are showing. There are also little date indexes which would appear on screen and those help, but for the most part I came to find that the chronology of the film cleared up with repetitive scenes that seem to belong to the same time period. The story does a great job at covering pretty much all bases of Piaf's life, from childhood to old age, and the drama in between is exciting, inspiring, and heartbreaking all at once. Another Oscar winning element for this film is its make-up. As mentioned, the film jumps around in time, and the make-up on Cotillard to portray Piaf is truly incredible. Especially in the depiction of Piaf's middle adulthood (30-40s) the combination of Cotillard's phenomenal acting and make-up really brought Piaf's character alive. Oh, the wonders of make-up. In addition, everything in the mise-en-scene helped to emphasize the atmosphere of the setting. With the help of editing and the soundtrack, different parts of Paris transcend through the screen. I fell in love with the aesthetics of the film, and felt emotionally attached to the characters. A really fantastic portrayal of a music icon.

Lucy," Amazing effects and a great concept but a terrible story.
","Firstly, the main reason why I found this movie terrible is probably because I know that the 'humans only use 10% of their brains' nonsense to be, well, nonsense. If we only used 10% of our brains, that means we wouldn't even have our basic five senses as the control of these senses are scattered all over the brain. From a scientific standpoint, it is just not logical. And even if we pretend for a second that this is possible, unlocking the full potential of our brains wouldn't allow us to control matter or other people, or feel the world and its existence. This is why I found this terrible.The reason I say it has a great concept is based on the drugs entering the system and giving her abilities. I feel that without all that content on the brain they could have done so much more if they had just added more to her background. The trailer itself looks really promising, but in reality the trailer is better than the film. The story had a lot of scientific information added in, but it had a lot of philosophical material in it too which I did not get the relevance. Plus it contrasted scenes of the wild when she was being captured. Personally, I do not like juxtaposition of scenes that are not actually from the film to be in a film. It just emphasizes the fact that what I'm watching is not real.Even though I did not like this movie, the visual effects were still incredible. The colours were visually stimulating and complimented the movie well. Though the acting was not terrible, I felt it to be a bit dry.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com.",4,2,9,25 August 2014
The Sixth Sense," Brilliantly made and acted with a thriller element.
","I watched this before when I was younger and could still remember some of the scenes that had ingrained itself in my brain. My memory of this film was that it was horrifying, but after watching it again, it wasn't as scary as I'd remembered. But M. Night Shyamalan definitely did a good job in keeping the thriller feel of the movie throughout.This film is just so brilliantly made and considering that it was made before the turn of the century, the visual effects were pretty good too. Every scene is so carefully executed with utmost precision that I had actually forgotten the crucial element of the story when I was watching this.The acting is also magnificent. I had just watched Pulp Fiction prior to watching this (and I'm sorry but I do not get what Pulp Fiction is about and probably won't even review it) that I was somewhat taken aback at the change in Willis' character. Willis really got into his character here and you can really see the drastic difference between the characters he usually plays. Haley Joel Osment, is just my favourite child actor ever. The other movie he was in; Pay It Forward, is another favourite of mine and I don't know how the learned to act when he was so young but his face just makes the audience empathize with him. Toni Collette who plays Cole's mother is also a vivid character in this. She plays the conflict of loving her child and at the same time being frightened of him, perfectly. Her expressions were very readable.The music in thisI don't think I noticed all that much. But what made this film all the more scary and which horror films have become experts at, are the sound effects. Whenever something is about to happen, the sound build-up matches the rising tension and then the brief sound explosions further enforces the impact when something appears. I think I probably got more frightened by the sound effects than the visual input itself.Overall, this film is a masterpiece, however the ending was a bit abrupt for me. I did not fully understand what the closure was.Read more movie reviews at: championagels.wordpress.com",9,0,1,9 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great visuals and interesting characters, but a generic narrative.
","I would just like to put it out there, that I am not what you would call a 'fan' of Star Wars. So for fans, I guess you can stop reading now. I do not actually think I have watched a full Star Wars film before now, thus, I do not get the references or who the characters are. This review then, would be from a point of view of a casual viewer. The action is all very well done and the visuals spectacular. It must cost a bomb to create the costumes and settings for the scenes. It really is amazing how the film-makers are able to create a whole other universe that looks so tangible. The visual effects are pretty cool too. Ridley and Boyega are likable as the two alternating protagonists, and their characters are well developed. They play their roles well, and this allowed the film to segregate itself from other Star Wars films. Introducing new characters (correct me if I'm wrong) to an already established series is always a gamble, but in this instance it paid off. Now they can continue the series for another trilogy. I especially liked how Rey is portrayed as a strong woman and she frequently points out how she can take care of herself. In this way the film tries to display feminist views, but still does not go all the way. I mean the only other woman character of importance in the film is Princess Leia. Looking at the cast, it does seem like there are quite a few female actresses, so at least the film is making an effort to be equal. Though I like the two protagonists, the story is a little generic for me. There's fighting, capture, escape, fighting, rescue, fighting, and scene. Perhaps, it's because I do not know much of the story which is why I found it to be pretty basic. For other casual viewers, the film is a nice way to pass the time for great visuals and action. However, you won't turn into an instant fan after watching it, and it doesn't give much in terms of narrative development.",7,2,7,2 May 2016
Rear Window," An enticing plot with great cinematic shots and a well defined set.
","Starting off, it seemed like an OK film, I mean it was made in the 50's and it showed. However, things got rolling when Jefferies first suspects the murder and suddenly the audience is very involved. Most of the time we see what Jefferies sees, but sometimes we get a glimpse of more. This and the fact that we see only windows from other buildings, is very Hitchcock like, in the sense that he was heavily influenced by psychoanalysts like Freud.He plays a lot on the sense of frames: the screen we're watching it on –> the camera lens –> the window Jefferies looks out of –> the windows of the neighbours he/we see through. And essentially he is the voyeur and we are the voyeur x2.The acting was pretty good overall, Stewart does an all right job, though isn't very convincing in his argument. Kelly was good too, and her character was well established, though the romance scenes between them were very stale and awkward to watch. However, Raymond Burr really transmits the aura of his character so well and we as the audience can feel a kind of tension surrounding him.I honestly didn't know what this film was about until I watched it, and didn't know if he did or did not kill his wife. So I was trying to figure it out as the film progressed, and it was very engaging. The last scene was really well done, when it got to the climax I think I was unconsciously tensing up. The look gave me the shivers. Side-note: Heard that the movie 'Disturbia' was based on this. I was much more freaked out and disturbed by that film than this, but I see how it relates.

The Matrix," Intricate story with great action and effects.
","This is honestly my first time watching this film, unless I saw it when I was really young in which case I don't remember anything about it. It's very interesting to note that the definition of 'the matrix' from the film has nothing to do with the bending of the back into that limbo position, and yet it has become known as that in the world. Even to people who have never really seen the film (like me), still refer to that action as matrix.I actually really like this film, I don't know if I love it, but I definitely will watch the sequels and probably even need to watch this one again soon. The reason being that I did not totally understand what was going on in respect to the transition between worlds, until my friend clarified it for me and it made so much more sense after. However, I didn't realize I hadn't understood until I talked about it, as the film really engages you with its actions, effects, dialogue - basically everything. There is so much going on in the film at one time, that even if you do not fully understand what is happening, you are invested in that moment there and then.The acting was good too, though the speech did feel a little dry at times. Hugo Weaving portrays the villain character very well and his expressions speak volumes. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are also very badass in this, I like it! Though I do have to comment on the fact that Trinity is the only prominent female character in this and she is reduced to emotion, once again promoting the male = active, female = passive, binaries.Speaking of badass, the action scenes were really on point. It was very fast-paced and has that glitch feel to it which emphasizes the concept of the world. It does feel odd sometimes and I know this is part of the concept, but I really hate (can't stand it ever) when there is flying involved in fights. I just cannot deal.The effects were phenomenal, and seems really progressive of its time. I mean this was before the turn of the century, and yet we are still getting movies with not so great visual effects today.Also, it is great how the film covers almost all aspects of life: action, romance, friendships, violence, society, digital age and whatnot. I've read reviews that attribute philosophical and religious meanings to this, but I personally prefer not to go along those lines. A really great film, and I can't help but wonder if Inception was influenced by this. The Wachowski Brothers really have a trademark in the stories they tell; I was not surprised when I found out they directed Cloud Atlas as well, it has a similar style to The Matrix. Plus they even created V for Vendetta, one of my favourites, but they didn't direct it which shows because it doesn't really have their style in it.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9,1,2,12 April 2015
Looper," Cool story and great acting but had too much unnecessary stuff.
","Honestly, the ending was what had the most impact for me. The build- up took too long and I felt that half the movie was spent by characters murmuring between each other. It didn't help that my friends were loud, but I couldn't hear the dialogue for quite a lot of the film — and the TV volume was at 100%. But the thing is even when I didn't hear what was said, I still understood what was going on, which goes to show that they had a lot of unnecessary dialogue that just slowed the pace of the movie down.Another thing that I feel was unnecessary was the blood. The action scenes were pretty good but some were overkill (and unrealistic) with unnecessary blood spraying.Apart from that, the story and plots were pretty cool. The acting as well was great, Pierce Gagnon gave me the chills. Joseph Gordon- Levitt was great as always, though it was a bit unnerving to see his face altered to look like a younger Bruce Willis. Willis' acting was pretty average, I wasn't very focused on him.Overall the film was good but could have been much better if they cut a lot of the dialogue and maybe added some more futuristic gadgets and stuff.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6,0,1,16 November 2014
Deadpool," Dark humour with appreciable effects
","The acting is great overall, but what really makes the characters is the screenplay. Dialogues, comments, references, and conversations are superbly written and provides a light atmosphere to dark situations. I am not familiar with the Deadpool comics, but it seems that the film does follow closely to the comics. The humour is consistent throughout the film and brought something fresh to the abundance of superhero movies. This film is pretty explicit as there is quite a lot of (almost) nudity and a bit of swearing though it isn't totally overdone. I'm surprised that it is only rated as 15 and above, I would give it an 18 and above. There are quite a lot of adult jokes that young ones should not be exposed to. Additionally, I was not expecting the breaking of the fourth wall and was caught quite off guard. I generally do not like it because it triggers me out of the film, however after the initial shock it was used quite well. It adds to the character of Deadpool as someone very blunt and direct. The way that the screenplay explicitly mentions and refers to things that are not in the context of the film itself is what makes it unique. (A little teaser example: the beginning credits show a green lantern playing card) That is what primarily makes this film so entertaining to watch. Also, the visual effects and slow motion scenes are very well done. Right from the beginning, you get the sense that this a not a typical film. Not only is the film told from multiple points un- chronologically, but also slows down certain scenes, or even stops the time sometimes. I am very impressed with the beginning credits scene and how the camera moves through the different obstacles. A+ to the visual effects and editing team. The soundtrack also does great in complementing the mood and 'troll-like' humour of Deadpool. However there are certain ideologies at play in the film that I do not care for. For one, the girlfriend happens to be a stripper/prostitute -is that really the only profession that they could think of? Also, the cab driver, Dopinder, is Indian. Must we really depict all cab drivers as Indian? Other than that, I do not think there are other races portrayed in the film that get a significant part. Perhaps it was written in the comics, but that does not mean it has to be enforced in the film.Overall an entertaining film with excellent visuals, screenplay and great acting. It is just a little explicit at certain points and the stereotypes are a definite negative.",8,1,9,15 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A screenplay that verges on the point of trolling, but with cool action scenes.
","The movie started off pretty well, but it soon went downhill when I realized what kind of movie this was. Such troll, would be how I would describe this movie. The jokes are so corny that it just felt too ridiculous. OK, it was quite funny at times but not enough to make up for the rest of the ridiculousness.The story itself is also a little typical. We have the bad guy, corrupt people in high places, the good guys, and the novice spy who becomes a professional during a crisis. And though I should be glad that this film did not have a typical romantic ending, in this case I will make an exception.The character of the bad guy played by Samuel Jackson is just so offensive that I can't believe it. First off, he is of dark skin, which wouldn't really have made a difference except that in this case he had a lisp. So on top of being overall racist (black person playing a bad guy), they are emphasizing that racism by giving him a speech impediment (black people can't speak). I am hoping that this is the result of them so subtly bringing to light issues/ stereotypes by blatantly showing it.The swearing and the gore. Oh my goodness. Really not necessary and adding to the ridiculous factor. I'm not a fan of swearing at all, but in some cases I concede that it actually helps to get the point across. But overusing it is definitely too much. The gore in fighting scenes too was a little much. The fireworks is ridiculous.Though the gore was too explicit, the action scenes were actually pretty good. In fact, they were great. The camera work, fighting, editing, all worked together to create great action scenes. The music helped too.There is a lot of big names in this, and they all played their part relatively well, but it does not change my mind about what I think about this film. I am also thinking that a lot of the humour in this film is 'British' so it is subtly but in a blatant way, showing all the things wrong in cinema or the world today. I don't know. Please let it be satirical.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6,1,7,27 March 2015
Minions," Great characters with amazing animation and a hilarious script.
","Perhaps I am a little biased in my opinion of this film, as I loved the two Despicable Me movies, plus the minions was a theme for my residence floor last year. So as you see, I have a personal affiliation with the minions. I really enjoyed this.The story is simple but not boring or over-exaggerated. There are many little happenings throughout the film that add to the atmosphere and overall mood of the film. Choosing to focus on three minions (though I miss Dave) was a good call. The three different personalities – not to mention shape size – of these minions were so prominent and well established that instead of being 'minions' they were Kevin, Stuart and Bob. Kevin being the older brother, Stuart the rock star and Bob the most lovable.The animation was great with good effects and colours that matched the theme of the film. However, I do have to disagree with the extreme body sizes of some characters. Most have too tall and skinny bodies; Walter Nelson (Michael Keaton) and Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm) both look like a human version of 'Daddy long legs'. I guess however, that this adds to the impossibility element of the film.The voice acting was pretty awesome. I love Sandra Bullock, and she did great here, I almost couldn't recognize her voice in some places. She gave great energy to her character, as did Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton. I did not recognize Jennifer Saunders as The Queen, but it did sound familiar, and she was funny. But obviously the spotlight goes to Pierre Coffin and his marvellous gibberish minions talk. There is notably a lot of Spanish words and phrases in the minions speech in addition to many other languages that seem to just fit in randomly here and there. I was pleasantly shocked to hear Bob say 'Terima Kasih' which means thank you in Malay. Mad props to Coffin, to be able to voice the minions in a way that can be distinguishable between the three main characters.Maybe the reason I like this so much is because there is less obvious talking and more inferencing of what the minions are talking about. Because even though we do not understand them in the literal sense, we can still infer as to what they are referring to.This movie is more about having fun than anything else and I enjoyed it thoroughly.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,19,36,14 July 2015
Sin City," Creative
","The use of colour in this is very interesting and while it does resemble the feel of a comic book sometimes, it also feels very noir- I guess you could call it neo noir. This made the aesthetics of the film quite attractive as it was creative and different from other films. The black and white contrasts is more than just black and white, it's an intense black and white. This adds to the noir and expressionistic atmosphere of the film which reflects the dark narrative. Uses of other colour (like red, green, blue) is very vibrant and does not seem to have narrative purpose. In most instances, there is only one part in the scene that is of colour (like a dress, or the eyes) which instantly catches the attention of the audience. However, it seems to be randomized, like the creators of the film wanted to experiment with colour and added some whenever they felt like it. The colours are very saturated and intense too, further capturing our attention. The story is quite gruesome, and while I went into the film with no knowledge about what it's about, the settings help foreshadow the goriness. There is so much violence in this that 'Sin City' truly lives up to its name. I could have used without all that gore, but it was somewhat bearable to watch. Only a few instances did I have to look away from disgust. Also because it gives off the feel of a comic book (in that what is happening is fiction), that helps to digest some of the images shown. Apart from the creative use of colour, the editing, soundtrack and mise-en-scene (or digital intermediate) helped in creating the world of Sin City. Everything complemented each other well and just hearing the soundtrack alone reminds me of a video game. The editing and digital manipulations emphasized further the image of a comic book with non-realistic animation/movements and obvious digital backdrops. The cinematography does a fantastic job in keeping the audience engaged with its dynamic movements. As a whole, the film gives a visually stunning performance with aesthetic appeal. Additionally, all the actors and actresses did their parts well. I have a problem with the gender roles in this but will say nothing more on that matter. The voice of each different protagonist in each mini short (in the extended cut) is very similar to each other. The tone that is used establishes an alpha male in a sort of identity crisis, but who always plays the hero saving the damsel in distress. I like that the tone is consistent throughout as it gives the sense of continuity, but on the other hand, these different characters tend to blend into one another so that it could be one person/character.",8,0,3,1 March 2016
Spectre," Cool cinematography with a disappointing storyline and average acting
","I think I may start boycotting Bond films. It is just so misogynist! There are approximately two/three female characters in this and like almost 100% end up sleeping with Bond. How is he so irresistible? I think the film noticed the absurdity of this too and added in what seems to be a 'troll' scene, in which after surviving a fight, Bond looks at Swann and she asks 'What now?' or something along those lines. The next shot cuts to them making out on the way to do the inevitable. That scene was just too absurd and laughable. Anyway, if we put that misogyny aside for a second (what else will you get from a Bond film?), the film itself is pretty disappointing because the story was poorly developed. I just spent the last few minutes watching trailers of the previous movies (Skyfall, Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale) and they weren't actually so bad. From what I can remember anyway. Four Bond movies in less than 10 years! That is a bit too much isn't it? Because of its success, Bond films have been formulaic and repetitive. I wonder if it will ever stop. As long as there's money there's production no? This is a prime example of overdoing something, if we weren't so concerned about making a profit, poverty might be a smaller problem in the world. There is my little rant for the day. So, yes the story is not well developed in Spectre. It didn't capture my attention and I was just sitting there because I felt like I had to. If I were more inclined, I probably would have walked out halfway. I had no interest in the plots at all. Perhaps I forgot a lot of detail from the previous films, and so felt lost as to who the characters were and what their background was. However, they obviously have a lot of production value, so the visuals, effects and cinematography was great. What stood out for me, is the beginning scene which is one very long take. That was very well done. There are a lot of aerial scenes too and that added some nice scenery and landscapes to the picture. Visual effects of destruction of property and whatnot is pretty generic because this happens a lot in Bond films, but was still well done. The action though, did not feel very Bond like. It felt like the film focused more on 'story progression' than fighting as there didn't seem to be as many action scenes as before. I put story progression in quotation marks because the story was progressing but quite slowly and as said above, did nothing for me.As you can probably see, I feel cheated for spending my time and money at the theatre for this. There was good visuals, all right acting, and cool cinematography but the story was dreadful which made the film terrible.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6,2,5,15 December 2015
Joy," Quite interesting
","Having watched this on a plane, and missing parts of the story (as well as not completely finishing the movie), this review is based on parts that I did watch.The acting is pretty great, and the cast really did well at portraying their characters. The chemistry between characters has a palpable tension which aids in establishing the dynamics of the family. The settings too are well designed and help bring the era of that time back to life. Lawrence's character shows how perseverance and hard- work isn't all that is needed to be successful. Her reliance on other people proves detrimental, and the film pretty much says that to succeed you need to be the one who does everything. I really do want to finish watching the rest of the film now. Just to see how she ends up, and where the family members go from there.",6,0,1,27 April 2016
Coach Carter," Great story with good acting and editing.
","The film is based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter who benched his undefeated high school basketball team in 1999, because of their poor academic standings. While the film may not be an exact replica of what took place, it definitely is an inspiring story. It is good to know that some teachers care about where their students are headed in life, and want to put them in a position where they can better succeed.The basketball action is quite exciting - especially the alley oops. The practice sessions, and teamwork are all well played out as well. There were quite a few plays that made me go 'wow, that was good'. Apparently, Channing Tatum had not played basketball before the movie, so I guess it's a good thing we don't see him with the ball much. On the other hand, the players on the court the most: Brown, Gbewonyo, Ri'chard, and Tanner are all great handlers and shooters. Jackson as the coach acts his part well. He brings the intensity and sincereness of the character across the screen. The other actors also do well at playing teenagers wanting to appear cool. However, the narrative about the more grown up character Kenyon, and his girlfriend Kyra was a nice side story. Their struggles exemplified why Coach Carter fights so hard to keep them from failing their classes.Overall, a nicely made film that was both engaging and motivating. Having said that, I'm sure some parents or teachers would have supported Carter more vocally. The film basically showed Coach Carter against the world.",8,0,0,12 May 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," A creatively made film with outstanding performances.
","The three main characters include Jamal, his older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Freida Pinto). There were three actors behind each character; for when they were about 8 years, 15 years and then all grown up (I'm guessing the ages). And all of them, I must say, gave incredible performances.I've been wanting to watch this film for awhile and I think I actually did watch a bit once, but didn't finish it for some reason. Also, I was unaware that this was based on a book, Q & A by Vykas Swarup.Anyway, the director of this film juxtaposes scenes of the past and present stunningly. The audience is fed the information one by one and so it is more of showing us what happened rather than telling us along the way. This made it incredibly relevant for the audience as they knew what the characters had been through.This film also did not shy away from telling us how things really were in India. I've never been to India myself but making 20% of the film in Hindi really adds to the authenticity. The scenes in the landfills as well clearly showed the high rate of poverty and orphans in the city.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",10,0,4,16 June 2014
The Nice Guys," Surprisingly enjoyable
","This is the kind of movie I generally do not appreciate, but I was honestly surprised that I enjoyed it. Although it is a crime film, it is also tied nicely with a comedic atmosphere. The film is able to balance both the serious scenes with the funny ones, and it pays off. Gosling does a superb job with his character. While being both the smart one and the goofy one, his antics, behavior and lines are just so hilarious. Quite a few of his actions are *slap hand in face* worthy, and that's what makes it funny at times. Without a doubt, Gosling carries the film. At the beginning, I was not a big fan of Crowe's character. He play a tough guy who uses fists first, talk later. But after some time I grew to tolerate him. He does have some character development, mostly due to Holly, and I could go either way with that. We aren't given a lot into the other characters' background, but it works for this film. As mentioned, the subject matter of the film is one I do not generally enjoy. What with the swearing, prostitutes, pornography sounds, and the like. However, it is not explicit at all, save for one nude woman in the beginning (which was censored in my country), and the swearing. For a movie of this type, I would say it is one of the more tamed ones in terms of what they show. Set in the 70's, the mise-en-scene does a great job at bringing alive the era. As well, the story is engaging and fun. However, I am a little surprised that there isn't a romantic line in the film. Having said that, there is also not much of a female counterpart to the protagonists, in the sense that there is no presence of strong female characters. Amelia and Holly do portray that hardiness, and have quite a lot of screen time, however, the fact that they are young girls is a little concerning. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but if I had to say who the four main characters in the film are, it would be: March, Healy, Holly, and Amelia. Two middle-aged men, and two teenage girls. Think of that what you will.",7,2,5,2 June 2016
Me Before You," Great landscapes, but typical story
","Having read the book before knowing there was a movie coming out about it, I knew the whole plot. And knowing the whole plot made this film unexciting to watch for me. I just didn't feel like it was anything special. It might also be because of the story itself. I've outgrown romantic comedies, and though this does have a ending that isn't usually in romantic comedies, it still progressed as one. The characters are typical and not that interesting. Though having said that, Clarke as Louisa does a good job of bringing out her character's quirky and bubbly personality. Clafin's character on the other hand, is your typical rich boy with lots of baggage, and it's up to the girl to make the boy whole again. Not my cup of tea. Also, movies like these perpetuate the idea that boys and girls cannot remain in a platonic relationship if they are in close proximity to each other. While the characters are typical, the acting did the film justice enough. The characters were brought to life, and there is good chemistry between Clarke and Clafin, although it was somewhat awkward.The cinematography is well done, as it does a good job of showing the landscapes in the area. The sweeping and aerial shots of the castle gives audiences the impression of how big the space actually is. Also, wide shots of cities like Paris, is nicely done. However, I did not like the many close-up shots of the characters. I felt too close and intrusive. I'm not sure why people cried while watching this. OK, I mean I am quite detached from emotion when watching things, but I did not feel that there was much emotional buildup. Could have just been me. Overall, this is a well made film, but was a little boring to me.",6,1,7,4 June 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Great acting, script and directing.
","This film was very inspiring and well told. I am seeing Will Smith in a whole new light after this film (this is my first time watching), and I reckon he is actually somewhat like the father he portrays in the film - seeing as his real son plays his character's son. Anyway, Smith did really well in his role as Chris Gardner, and the expression of his emotions came across through the screen. Jaden Smith too, who was about eight years old then I think, was great. I am not such a big fan of him as he is now, but he had some good talent back then! The chemistry between father and son was perfect. Thandie Newton was good as well, you could really feel how tired and frustrated she was.The film was also very well made and the direction was superb. Cinematography was great and captured the atmosphere greatly, with long shots of Smith running here and there.However this film is not without it's flaws. There are quite a lot of times throughout the film in which got me thinking, 'why didn't he do this, or sell that?' I mean it is a movie (though it's based on a true story), and I guess people do things differently and if I were in the same position I might have done the same (maybe). But it seemed like he could have avoided some situations by thinking ahead and planning stuff better. Don't get me wrong I still think he did incredibly well seeing as he was practically running to get everywhere. I'm just thinking that maybe the film-makers added some extra drama to the character to make it worse, to enhance this story of the American Dream. As inspirational as this film is, it probably only happens to one in a million people; the American Dream is after all, an almost impossible dream.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8,0,0,31 August 2015
Sully," Slightly suspenseful
","The trailer does a good job at adding suspense to the film, and while it is exciting at times, the film overall has a feel of an educational video. Because it centers around a specific event, the film concentrates on showing us the before, during, and after scenes of that pivotal decision. Sully is a good watch, however, you might come out not thinking you watched a movie. Hanks and Eckhart do great together. Both totally embody their characters, so much so, that I did not even recognize them. More specifically Eckhart, because Hanks is recognizable anywhere. The emotions, especially that of intense thought from Hanks, is well done. Not only does Hanks portray his character's emotions well, but the film- making overall, does an incredible job at magnifying those emotions. Eastwood has done well in directing this film. In most cases, frequently jumping between the past, the event, and the present, can be confusing. However, it worked well for this movie. By not giving us all the details of one timeline at once, it adds more suspense to the movie. Also, the crafting of certain words and scenes makes the audience think in different directions. So, while the story is based on a true story, and seems to be quite accurate, it is rather thrilling the way in which it insinuates different outcomes. Overall, a well made film that was educational as well as a little thrilling. On the down side, I watched this in AVX (my first time), and was quite disappointed. It was not worth the extra money.",8,0,1,25 September 2016
Jurassic Park," Immerseful
","The story of Jurassic Park is certainly a unique one, and is based on the book of the same name by Michael Crichton. The creative world of Jurassic Park shows us one possibility of how dinosaurs would live if they existed in modern society. Though the science of it isn't very convincing, they did a great job at creating a scientific sort of atmosphere. Adding to that, the cast fits well into their roles, and the acting is pretty good. Sam Neill is a little expressionless and mumbles quite a bit, but is otherwise a good fit for his character. Larura Dern gives a great performance, and I especially like her rebuttals in the face of sexism. However, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, who play the grandchildren, are pretty much the only ones who react like they should when faced with a dinosaur- that is, with fright and terror. Jeff Golblum seems to be there only for comic relief, and mostly delivers his lines awkwardly. Surprisingly, the visuals for this film is very realistic and not at all like I would have imagined a 90's film to be. Not like some films with horrible CGI work, the film-makers and animators of Jurassic Park went through extensive renderings and scans to compile realistic visuals and movements of the dinosaurs. Some action is obviously fake, but overall, this film had great visual effects. Finally, the soundtrack for the film is amazing, with each song fitting into the setting of the scene perfectly. The suspenseful and thrilling scenes have music that aids in giving the audience that sense of anticipation. In some scenes the music is a little cheeky in that the film-makers are deliberately letting you know that something is going to happen, and is aware that you know. Overall, a fun film with excellent production quality and great directing. A film worthy of being in the 'classics' category.",9,2,4,24 March 2016
The Martian," Impressive
","Movies about space seem to be the new 'dystopia' movie with its rising popularity. We had Interstellar and Gravity, and both were very heavy and intense films. So it was a nice change for The Martian to have a lighter mood while still having space complications. The humour of Watney's character complements the film nicely and helps to lift the mood of the seriousness of his situation.Damon plays his role superbly and delivers his lines perfectly. His delivery is very natural and the vlogs that he does (which ultimately speaks directly to us) is informative without being too obvious of a tell. The chemistry between him and the rest of the crew members are well formed, especially with Chastain and Pena. There was even a hint of something else going on with Chastain and Damon's characters but that might just have been too much of Hollywood's influence that made me think that. Glover does a fantastic job as a sort of 'mad scientist' of the computer generation, and there is a hint of Troy (from Community) in there too. Ejiofor too does a great job as the communication link between NASA and Watney. Pretty much all actors and actresses held their own. The inclusion of so many characters with quite equal screen time (save for Damon) shows how the people working in NASA all need to collaborate in this highly sensitive atmosphere.The visuals of Mars are impressive, and according to my friend those Mars scenes were shot in The Grand Canyon. The desolate landscape and reddish brown colour of the dirt is convincing as an alien planet and the structures and equipment used there seems quite realistic. The design of everything is great, down to the visual effects and soundtrack.I am not really concerned about the physics and mathematics of the film, and choose to believe that what happened in the film can be done. The collaboration between NASA to help Watney figure out ways to survive is also shown in a montage which was cool to watch. What was not realistic was Watney's body transformation. I realize that weight loss would have been tremendous, but there are a few shots of a very skinny body with the face hidden which was definitely not Matt Damon and that bothers me.Overall, an impressive film with an engaging story, great acting and cool visuals that will transport you away.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Null,3,6,2 January 2016
Furious 7," Repetitive story with fast cars, action and average acting.
","I'm going to start by saying that I do not like these kinds of movies, and they hold no attraction for me anymore. Stories based on revenge and action, and men being all masculine showing off their muscles and justifying killings and destruction. Not to mention the objectifying of the female body. Is it really necessary to have women extras walking around almost naked and having close-ups of their asses? NO. I really cannot stress this enough, and how I really cannot stand movies that do this.The story seems really identical to the other films. Though I did not watch all the movies I do remember watching the 6th one and the 3rd one, and this series is just so formulaic. Bad guys, crew members who are like family taking the bad guys down, authorities stepping in, destruction, guns and fast cars. There isn't really anything new with the films and I really wonder what makes it so popular.That's about all I've got to say. Nice cars, cool races and action with some verging on impossible. I'm getting tired of watching films based on action and masculinity. For heaven's sake The Rock tensed his muscles and his cast came off! A super cheesy and super wtf moment.Also, I was wondering how they ended up fixing Paul Walker's parts, and it actually isn't very noticeable. I think his nose looks a teensy bit sharper towards the end, because they were using CGI effects in addition to the help of Walker's brothers but it could still go unnoticeable. There are quite a few scenes in the film in which had me thinking they had an editing problem though. Some lines would be repeated and some of the same shots played over again in the same sequence. I don't know what happened there.I know many might not agree with me, but I write how I feel and you don't have to agree. We all have different opinions.
