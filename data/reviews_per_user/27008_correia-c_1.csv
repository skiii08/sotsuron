The Equalizer," One of the best movies this year!
","I was really surprised by this movie. It's really entertaining! The movie communicate really well with the audience. Great picture! This is how heroes come to life! this is a good starting point for more movies 'equalizers'. I mean, i was seeing movies all year, and to someone like me that sees 'almost' every movie out there it's not easy to get glued to the screen! the story is not new but it was a pleasure to see it! nice! I really don't see how can others say this is not a good movie! Maybe it's not a NEW thing but it's very well made! I read that this movie is not good because the age os the main star! common? really? what else but not a experienced trained operative? I can say that if you see it you will not regret the time! I didn't!",8,2,10,17 December 2014
