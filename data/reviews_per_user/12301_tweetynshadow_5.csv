It," Really it could've been better.
",This movie was OK it really could've been a lot better I believe!!! For me the old 'it' is still my favorite!!! It will always be a classic!!! The new 'it' he looked kinda cute to me!!! Hahahaha not scary at all compared to the old 'it' now that clown freaked me out and there really wasn't much to him!!! But that's just my opinion. Still think the old 'it' was way better and way more scary than this one!!! But you can be your own judge...I'm hoping part 2 will be a little better.,7,1,2,15 September 2018

A Quiet Place," I did not care for this movie
",Well i don't care for this movie because I have a lot of unanswered questions!!! I needed more explaining to be done on a lot of things!!! Yes this movie was kind of intense at times but I still need answers!!! I also was very upset at the way it ended!!! If there is a part 2 I how they do some explaining in there but at the same time I probably wouldn't even watch it because I was disappointed in this movie it could've been so much better but instead I'm here with unanswered questions...,3,2,4,15 September 2018
