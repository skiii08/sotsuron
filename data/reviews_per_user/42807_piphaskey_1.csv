Despicable Me 2," Loved it
","I only went to see the film because the timings fit my day best and i wasn't that excited but from the minute it started i loved it! I had a great time with my family and we laughed so much it was almost embarrassing because we were so loud, this film is great family entertainment and don't worry if u think your to old to find it funny because i'm 14 and loved it and my mom found just as awesome !!
