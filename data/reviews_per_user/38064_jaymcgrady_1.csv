Alien 3," Awful
","David Fincher has destroyed everything that James Cameron and Ridley Scott created. Firstly he kills off Newt and Hicks. Hicks was the love interest of Riply and Newt was supposed to replace Riply's dead daughter. If that was not bad enough we have to witness Newt's autopsy. Then just a Riply starts to trust Bishop at the end of Aliens, his evil creator (played by Lance Hendriksen)turns up. Fincher may of directed great films like Seven, Fight Club and The Game but it will be a long time before I forgive him for Alien 3.",7,11,18,28 May 2002
