The New World," Overall poor - don't waste the money
","I had the choice of seeing End of the Spear or this and chose wrongly! Colin Farrel does not a good movie make. It needs a great script, great cinematography, a decent editor and a great supporting cast. This film had none of those. The Pocahontas actress was decent enough for an amateur I suppose (she learned English quite quickly). There was a period in the film where she is separated from John Smith, and told he is dead. There is no explanation for telling her that. Then he shows up later and continues their relationship. She was as confused as I was! The overall story was disjointed in the filming of it. Also, the point of view of the camera was very confusing. Shooting very close on battle scenes and never giving the viewer the bigger perspective. I thought it was going to be an interesting story about the beginnings of America. Don't waste your money or your time (2.5 hours!).",4,3,9,23 January 2006
