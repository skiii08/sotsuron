The King's Speech," Great ensemble acting
","This is a typical brilliant British film, carried along by its dialog and a great cast. It's a period piece that puts you right into the 1930s. The interplay between Albert and Lionel - strained by the British awe of the Royal Family - leads to misunderstandings, false starts, all of which are overcome by Lionel's belief in Albert, and Albert's determination to 'see the thing through'.My only criticism is of Churchill's character. He gets the voice quite well, but someone in the makeup department surely hated Mr Spall. It's the worst Churchill I've ever seen. That's surprising, given that Churchill is such an iconic image in England.Other than that, this is a movie worth getting on DVD and watching again. The second time through, you'll see something you missed the first time.",10,0,1,27 December 2010
Despicable Me 2," So-so sequel
","Like many sequels, this one falls short of the original. The first movie is set apart by its originality, and the transformation of the arch-villain Gru into a soft-hearted father.This time around, Gru and the kids are already settled, and he's retired from villlainy. The only thing to do is bring him out of 'retirement' to do battle with yet another villain, who wants to take over the world (don't they all?).Throughout the movie, minions abound, providing comic relief (in a comedy).But most of the action is only a little more than ordinary. Some sight gags work well, but not enough to make this sequel stand out. some scenes just run too long - the Cinco de Mayo party, for one.There's a possibility of a third movie, and with a partner for Gru, the stage is set for something completely different. But I'll wait and see.",6,3,6,17 July 2013
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A new Sherlock Holmes
","This is not your old Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. This takes place in a parallel universe where Sherlock has become a master of martial arts and no-holds-barred street fighting. Any resemblance to the Sherlock we know from the books is purely coincidental.If you see the movie with that understanding, you'll see a great action movie, with Sherlock fighting innumerable Bad Guys. Doyle's Bad Guys also inhabit this parallel universe: Professor Moriarty is a higher math professor, as well as a maniacal 'take over the world' type. More sinister is the parallel Sebastian Moran.The parallel Mycroft is excellently played by Stephen Fry. I kept asking, 'Why is Oscar Wilde in this movie?', until I saw the credits.Jude Law makes an excellent Watson. The script has him as having served in Afghanistan (yes, there was a war going on over there then).Irene Adler makes a smallish appearance at the beginning, and Inspector Lestrade an even smaller appearance at the end.There is gratuitous nudity in the movie, but unfortunately, it's Mycroft.If you've read the Conan Doyle books, you know about Reichenbach Falls. So you really need to pay close attention to the last 5 minutes of the movie.",8,3,11,17 December 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Left me cold
","There's something about this one that left me cold - uninvolved.But first: if you haven't seen it yet, stay through the final credits - all of them. There's a trailer that's really a preview of a new X-Men movie.This time around, Stan Lee is easy to spot. He even gets a speaking line. I wonder if they paid him scale......After a few giant monster movies, the genre gets old. I saw nothing new and interesting about this movie's monsters. Big, nasty, powerful - yawn, been there, done that. There's an interesting contrast between Parker/Spiderman and Wayne/Batman: Batman comes from a wealthy family (and has Michael Caine as a Number Two), lives in a mansion; Parker and his aunt are barely getting by, live in an apartment.The spider-silk acrobatics are too far out to be believable. Each journey through the city (always conducted at altitude) takes at least 23 times his own body weight in silk thread.On the other hand, the special effects are great. Downtown New York has been destroyed in so many movies, it's a wonder anybody stays there.The local theater where we saw it dropped the 3D version early. I asked the manager about that; he said hardly anybody went to that one. I wonder of the thrill of 3D is wearing off.Bottom line: I'd go for the special effects, not the story.",Null,7,16,17 May 2014
Total Recall," Over the top roller-coaster ride
","We saw it at a revival house last weekend. The first thing that came to mind is, hey! that's our Governor up there! The second thing was, 'recall' way the way he got to be governor.I thought it as a little over-the-top in a few places - especially at the end, where they go bug-eyed in the rare Martian atmosphere.Sharon Stone did a great job going from Quaid's loving wife to the deadly agent.I'll pass on the suspension of belief needed to accept that the air-generating plant could build up an atmosphere on the planet in less that 5 minutes.The other thing that stands out is the product placement - almost every scene had a recognizable product.",7,0,1,23 January 2010
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Another shoot-em-up summer movie
","That's a charitable 4 - for effort. They tried. The special effects are quite good.This one is loosely based on characters created by Tolkien, but they're put into situations way outside his story line.Other reviewers have noted the goofs.Ryan Gage's Alfrid was probably put in to provide comic relief, but I believe your comic relief character should have some likability. Alfrid is about as likable as one of the lesser orcs.The Thorin/Tauriel sub-story was unconvincing at best. Did it never occur to the writers that a male/female relationship could be a friendship at the same level as Bilbo's and Thorin's?Most of us who grew up with the early Gene Autry/Roy Rogers westerns will recognize the eagles as the cavalry charging in over the hill to save the day. What were they waiting for?Spoiler!!!The coincidence of Bilbo arriving back at his home in the Shire, just as his stuff is being auctioned off, stretches belief to the breaking point.",4,3,7,9 January 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," A big little movie
","Not that we need another review - just go see it. This is one of the few movies that I could watch again.First, the trivia: This is Kara Hayward's first movie. She was 12 when cast. So was Natalie Portman, in 'LÃ©on: The Professional'. Hayward could well have a great career in film.Next up: 'PG-13, for smoking'. Sheesh.Everybody knows the basic story - but what about the film? The camera work is amazing. It opens up with a tour through Suzy's parents' home, going from room to room, floor to floor. We first see Suzy, looking straight out at the camera (us?) through her ever-present binoculars. Later, we're in the 'Kakhi Scouts' camp, where we meet Scout Master Ward. As he walks to the breakfast table, the camera follows him from the side, not from ahead. There's an empty chair at the table, then we're off and running.I thought Sam's character looked a lot younger than Suzy's. Could that be on purpose? Suzy's makeup, blue eyeliner, gives her an older look. Behind those glasses, Sam looks younger.There's a Narrator (Bob Balaban), a bit like a Greek Chorus, who opens the story, and fills us in on some of the details, and finally interacts with the searchers to tell them where they might look for the fugitives.Some of the scenes are marvelous (maybe a Wes Anderson trademark?). In 'St Jack's Church', just before a major hurricane, they're performing Britten's 'Noye's Fludde'. The set inside the church is brilliant.(The classical music selections (Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, Simple Symphony - both by Britten) - are the Leonard Bernstein recordings.)Harvey Keitel (who's doing a lot of work these years) plays 'Commander Pierce', the commander-in-chief of the Kakhi Scouts, a grizzled old veteran who takes his job seriously.Tilda Swinton (reprising her character as the White Witch in the Narnia movies) plays the character known only as 'the social worker'. Her job in to find Sam and put him in a juvenile facility, something everybody else doesn't really think is a good idea. One example of the way Anderson unfolds the story: we find out that Sam's an orphan, and he's run away (again) from foster parents. The scene with Capt. Sharp talking to them (split-screen), shows them in a kitchen - leading you to think they're just plain old folks who've taken in a foster child. Later on, we see that it's really a pretty large facility, with at least a half-dozen other boys (looking mostly like James Dean in a 50s movie).One thing to think about: The cast includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray (of course), Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton .... and two complete unknowns, the real stars and central focus of the movie. First off, all that talent never overshadows the two stars - it's their movie, their story. Second, would it have been any better - or worse - if another group of unknowns had been cast in all those supporting roles? Did the producers figure nobody would see it if the A-list wasn't in it?Two other groups in the cast stand out: the three other Bishop kids, and the scout troop - all first-rate actors.Unfortunately, there's no screen credit for the dog. (A bit part, but essential to the story.)",9,1,2,11 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Third one is a topper
","Far too many sequels fall short of the original. This is one series where 'III' outdoes the first two. This one has heart, has a good story, has brilliant animation (about 95% of the final credits to to Indian animators).It has a suitably villainous villain ('Capitane Dubois'), who has one of the best scenes in the movie: she sings the Edith Piaf blockbuster 'Non, je ne regrette rien'. (We saw her the other day in 'Moonlight Kingdom').The interplay between the Bear and Julien is marvelous. The animation is superb.There's a bit of artistic license in getting the stars from Africa to Monaco, but we can overlook that.There are many outside references (and in-jokes, most of which I probably missed). One is when the circus is rehearsing, and one of them talks about 'this Canadian group' - that's the Cirque du Soleil.I wasn't expecting much (remembering the first two, and considering what usually happens to sequels), but this is one of the year's best.",8,1,2,15 June 2012
