The Avengers," The Avengers did assemble. But are they really so great?
","I went to see The Avengers in a movie theater in Paris. It actually seemed kind of strange that it premiered there a week before it did in the United States. Nevertheless, I wanted to watch it in order to prove to myself that some Marvel Universe productions based on comic books can be outstanding. Unfortunately, as I left my seat I thought that, like all the previous one-superhero- shows, it disappointed me entirely.Why, should you ask?Basically, the plot is childish, but I wouldn't expect more from a big budget blockbuster made only to pleasure the masses. As of now, it can somehow achieve the greatest opening ever. Wow. It already made a fortune from the great marketing campaign that started weeks before the opening day. That's truly brilliant, considering WHAT is being advertised throughout the world as one of the best movies in years.I must admit, it is strangely awesome that they were able to assemble such a cast of stars and pack them into one two-hour film. The names speak for themselves. But what can be achieved with so many highly-paid actors when the whole idea behind the picture seems dull? I love to see all of the well-known faces shown on the screen together at one particular moment, but when the scene isn't entertaining the point is really becoming unimportant.The dialogues are cheap. They do not show any insight into the characters' positions in the circle of The Avengers. Of course, in order to fully understand who is who and the relations between the heroes it is mandatory to watch all of the movies that show the origins of every single person. Now I want to point point some out a few aspects that make the movie a little more enjoyable. There were a few nicely implied gags that made me laugh. Most of them were connected with Hulk's turbulent nature. And that is always a good thing to make fun of. Also the many sarcastic, but highly intelligent remarks made by Tony Stark made me believe that Iron Man must certainly be the most amazing guy in the entourage. Additionally I would like to note that you don't have to watch the movie in 3D in order to get the best experience (the enormous potential of this technology isn't actually given). All of the epic major explosions, blasts, rampages and spectacular fights are providing great special effects in themselves. This is the part that is probably the most pleasurable - when the Avengers team do not speak to each other, but just fight their way through evil forces in order to stop Loki, Thor's brother. Action sequences are decent and the camera motions that shifts between all of the battling heroes deserve a recognition.All in all, I have to say that I would much rather read the comic book while riding a subway to work than waste my time seating in the cramped cinema on a Thursday evening. Now I just have to hope that all the other 2012 epic superhero productions will be better. Because even after this 'slight' disappointment I still believe that this year will provide the greatest entertainment in this genre that the world has ever seen.",6,5,15,4 May 2012
Vertigo," Describe the movie in one word: Excellence
","If you have ever, even for a second, doubted Alfred Hitchcock's genius and mastery of the cinematic craft, you probably haven't seen Vertigo. I mean, all of his films are fantastic and should be considered as undisputed classics, but this particular flick has something in it that makes it seem, in my opinion, like the essential Hitchcock, the one to be called his best.I don't know whether it's the supernatural aura surrounding the whole story depicted in Vertigo or not, but I was caught in the storyline right from the beginning. It certainly is one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema, and one that will send chills down the spine even after more than 50 years after its premiere.'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired police detective, after experiencing the death of one oh his fellow co-workers, is trapped in the dizzy circle of vertigo, the strange and psychedelic state of nausea brought by the fear of heights. Even though it might seem like an insignificant fact at first, it is a crucial aspect needed to understand the whole story of Vertigo.One day he gets a rather strange request from Gavin Elster, a friend from the old college days. Even though he isn't working anymore, he accepts the assignment, which involves sneaking and spying on Elster's beautiful wife, Madeleine. She is supposed to be possessed by some sort of eerie forces or a ghost from the past, which makes her wander around town doing rather strange things. At first Scottie is very skeptical about the whole situation and simply laughs at the possibility of the involvement of some out-of-this-world creations. But as he gets deeper and deeper into this job he starts to believe that, indeed, something is not right. What's more, he falls in love with the woman on the way and wants to help her with all his heart. And then, suddenly, the Earth comes calling back – Madeleine commits suicide jumping out of a church's tower. Scottie is in a state of shock and isn't able to lead a normal life. Everywhere he goes he sees her pretty face. And when one day he meets a girl so similar to her, he begins to transform her into the lovely woman from his memories.I must say that James Stewart has always been a great actor, but in the movies directed by Hitchcock he rose to a level of pure genius. The way he portrays an aging detective, who is entangled with love and then, unexpectedly, struck with grief, is unforgettable and very convincing. I love the passion in his eyes, the way he is able to show the fear of heights represented by sudden seizures. Even though I'm not a big Kim Novak fan I think that she did a good job playing this possessed woman, trapped in the past, with a dark mystery hidden behind all of her actions.Vertigo is also a groundbreaking achievement in the sense of camera use and visual effects. The impression of falling given by the spiraling out-of-control movements of the cameras in the memorable tower scene produces a thrilling experience. I could only imagine how shocking it must have been in those times. A true masterpiece in cinematography, no doubt about it.Hitchcock was always able to astound the viewers with omnipresent suspense, fantastic plots, marvelous actors and this particular style that no one was ever able to copy. I must say that Hitchcock is one of the reasons for my fascination with the film world and Vertigo has always been the picture that, for me, defined the highest peak in his career.",10,3,6,23 May 2012
Chinatown," Polanski's brilliance strikes again
","Roman Polanski's Chinatown is definitely one of the best crime thrillers when it comes to both its fantastic structure and complex character study. It's his fascinating take on the corruption, greed and violence that lead people to become inhumane and brutal towards one another. It's like this real, and metaphorical 'Chinatown' in every bigger town in the USA – a place where everything happens on its own rules. Or even better, there aren't actually any rules, just the law of the jungle, one might say. Of course the rule applies as much to a single district, as to a whole city, or even country.J. J. Gittes has to cope with one of the hardest cases that he had ever encountered. Normally, it all comes down to a few pictures of a cheating spouse (that's his business all right) to end a chapter. But this time it's something much bigger and more dangerous. He embarks on a path, which heads toward the discovery of a scheme that concerns the whole city of Los Angeles and its huge water supply. What's more, in all this crazy, dizzying mess Gittes meets a very fascinating and troubled woman, with a difficult mystery attached to herself.After spending time with her Gittes is able to realize how pathological her family really is. And pathology is a right word in this context, as the amount of incest and other closely related themes is enormous. The uncontested brilliance that Polanski has shown in Chinatown is contained in its complicated storyline and great use of symbolism, connected to every thing water-y. Almost everywhere you can sense the impact put on various connotations regarding water, not only in dialogues but also in the aspect of sensual experiences. For example, tapping water in the sink plays great with the overwhelming silence in the scene, where J. J. discovers a dead body on the floor. I really admire Jack Nicholson for his marvelous work in every picture that he stars in, but his role in Chinatown is for me the definition of his career. The way he plays Gittes just makes you want more of his on-screen time (even though he is the main character). He sometimes shows a very serious side of his nature, but he can also come up with a fine amount of great jokes and insults. He is sacrificing his own life to terminate a case, which he wasn't even supposed to be involved in. Nicholson shows a bunch of acting skills that make his act very believable and entertaining. Faye Dunaway gives a decent performance as this classy, but very disturbed woman trying to help herself cope with the peculiar problems of her strange family. Note: Don't miss the very funny cameo by Polanski, who plays this scary, tiny man with a knife. Many laughs assured!Polanski also makes a great use of the plot device known as a MacGuffin. The murder, which occurs in the beginning of the film isn't actually the thing that drives the plot later on. Even though Gittes is trying to find the killer, the picture is more about an insight into the characters and their profiles to provide a definitive explanation of this gruesome story.All in all, I highly recommend Chinatown as one the best avant-garde crime movies ever directed and one of the finest, freshest takes on the pristine noir genre. Great directing, thrilling storyline and many detailed puzzles hidden in it account for a most memorable experience.",8,7,12,25 May 2012
As Good as It Gets," A comedy that will please every heart
","As Good As It Gets is a truly magnificent feel-good comedy that through a detailed look on its three main characters is able to draw viewer's attention right from the very first moments. It's full not only of brilliantly clever laughable sequences, but also of so many realistic notions and situations, which can actually happen in anyone's life. From the creative mind of the great James L. Brooks comes a story that contains so many wonderful and unexpected twists, combining for an on-screen relationship that no one will ever suspect.Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obnoxious, pedantic, obsessive-compulsive (there are many other adjective that obviously come to mind about his persona) writer, who doesn't give a damn about nobody else's feelings but his. He leads a life of pure selfishness, devoid of any friends, lovers or partners. He loves to make fun of his homosexual neighbor and artist, Simon (Greg Kinnear), and his cute little doggy named Verdell. Already in the first scene he shovels this adorable puppy down the waste chute. Even though he knows that everybody actually hates him, the thought of it doesn't really concern him. Following his every day routine (the hilarious strolls around New York City, when he omits chewing gum on the pavement) he eats breakfast at a nearby diner, where he orders only through one particular waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt). And all those activities would probably never change, if it weren't for a few sudden events that took place and turned his peaceful life upside down. First of all, Simon is hospitalized after he becomes a victim of an unexpected assault and Melvin has to take care of his dog (discreetly forced by Simon's friend and art dealer Frank). Second of all, Carol has to stay in at home and look after her sick son that one day. When Melvin comes to the restaurant and sees that she isn't there, he is so frustrated and angry thathe arranges a private doctor and full medical care for Carol's son, just so she can get back to work and serve his meals. A bit eccentric, don't you think? On top of this Simon realizes that he doesn't have any more money and has to take a trip to his parents' home in order to ask them for a loan. And who would drive him there? His good old buddy Melvin. He also asks Carol to come along, and she does so feeling a bit indebted to him. And believe me, totally hilarious and surprising things happen as the three unlikely pals travel through the country in a fancy convertible. Melvin suddenly decides that he has to get a hold of his true feelings and maybe finally let them out. Carol realizes somewhere on the way that Melvin can be really cute when he tries to, so she might actually give him a chance after all. Simon finds his true calling once again, which ends up making Melvin a little jealous. And what finally comes out of this very interesting threesome accounts for many heartwarming laughs, which is what a great comedy should always be able to do.Jack Nicholson is simply brilliant. Even though he plays a really nasty character, his performance is exactly the opposite. One is able to find some deep emotions in this seemingly emotionless man. He plays this part in a fresh, convincing, and utterly enjoyable manner in every single scene. No one else would be more appropriate for that role.Helen Hunt in a Oscar-deserving role as a woman, who wants to get something for herself this one time, after all those years spent on looking after a son. She simply lets go of every problem that's been troubling her and goes with the flow to find a greater meaning in her peculiar bond with an older, but certainly handsome, man.Greg Kinnear is a hilarious addition to the group, with the very persuasive performance as a very gentle and subtle guy, who has to go through a series of bizarre adventures just to find a real sense in his art.All in all, As Good As It Gets is one of the finest comedies build up on an analysis of completely different character traits, which, when put together, combine for a fantastic and lively cinematic experience. Clever and joyful dialogues, well-structured story and the mesmerizing passion coming out of the remarkable cast merge beautifully to create a top-notch comedy that everyone should watch at least once.",8,0,1,9 June 2012
Memento," A fresh and intriguing idea in a confusing mind game
","Memento, based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan and directed by his brother Christopher, is an essentially unconventional crime thriller, which due to its own nonlinear narrative technique and purposely confusing storyline, makes it somehow hard to categorize as such or as any other specific genre.Leonard Shelby (by any means don't call him Lenny), played persuasively by Guy Pearce, is a once successful insurance agent, who witnessed the rape and murder of his wife in his own home. What's more, the assassin has left him with an untreatable illness known as short-term memory loss. The last thing that Leonard is able to remember is the death of his wife, and thus, he is now on a deadly and vicious hunt for the man who took the love of his life and left him handicapped. On his journey he meets a few mysteriously suspicious people (especially Nathalie and Teddy), who sometimes want to take advantage of 'this thing that he has'. His brain isn't able to work in a proper manner, so in order to understand where he lives, who he meets, what he did, and what's the real purpose of his actions, he takes photos of people and locations and even tattoos important notes all over his body. When someone tries to discourage him by saying 'you aren't going to remember your revenge' he convincingly states: 'my wife deserves the revenge whether I remember it or not' and 'the world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes'.In the movie the viewer encounters two interconnected stories, one told forward (in black and white) and the other backwards (in colors). The former goes on as we see Leonard talking on the phone with an unknown person, while he reminisces about a man named Sammy Jankis, who had to deal with a similar memory loss problem. The latter shows all the events that lead up to the first scene (shot overlooking a negative of a dead person and a killing prior to that), actually revealing all the missing elements. Even though with every consecutive sequence the story starts to take shape and becomes less and less complicated, it still is confusing. But that's good, because the viewer has to assume that this is the sole purpose of the movie, and re- watching it or reading various interpretations online won't support us with any new hints, only random divagations and probably more confusion on the way. That's why I think the movie leaves the best impression when seen only once.Considering the fact that the narrative technique is straightly nonlinear, Leonard still operates on a daily basis in the regular timeline known to human mind. He isn't able to form any new memories, so the fact that the viewer observes all the events in a totally different order doesn't necessarily help the main character.As we move on with the often perplexing storyline we stumble onto a maze, which sort of produces another maze, and, in the process, intentionally creates a puzzle within a puzzle (with the peculiar interest in riddles and perplexing plots it's easy to see why Nolan went on to direct Inception in 2010). Memento is said to be one of the most scientifically accurate movies that deal with the problem of memory loss. In psychological evaluation, it not only realistically explains all the symptoms of this illness, but also presents one man's struggle to go on living his life no matter whether he will remember it or not. He just needs to have a certain goal that will make it all worthwhile. And the surprising ending, which I won't spoil here, gives him exactly wanted he wanted, and, in a deeper sense, all his actions seem to be justified in the thrilling finale.",8,0,2,2 July 2012
The Hunger Games," Survival of the fittest, children's edition
","Before I start I need to note that I only wanted to see this movie to have my own opinion about it, even though I knew right from the start that it won't be very entertaining to me. However, all that buzz surrounding The Hunger Games made me realize that maybe I should watch it just to be up-to-date with the movie news.I've never read the books, and, really, the topic of a 'game, where people hunt each other down in order to see who survives the longest' has been repeated in many pictures over the decades. Survival of the fittest, as one intelligent man once called it.I won't bore you with the synopsis, because it seems actually as simple and trivial as a child's story. The beginning is so simple, yet so tragic, that it is undeniably obvious what must happen through the 142 minutes screening time. After Katniss Everdeen has so bravely protected her little sister from taking part in the murderous, and tremendously unethical, annual Hunger Games the viewer already knows what must happen at the very end.I'm not really mad that the movie was so predictable. It is, after all, a big budget blockbuster, which was geared towards earning horrendous amounts of money even before the real production had started. It wasn't supposed to boost one's intellect.I just can't understand why they had to make such a long movie, with so many unnecessary and boring scenes and promote it as one of the biggest hits in the teen flicks category. I won't deny that it stands out from the crowd of such flops as, oh let's say, the whole Twilight series. But the overall excitement that appeared right with the premiere of The Hunger Games probably left many people totally unsatisfied. I know I was.As for some of the positive aspects, there were a few scenes that made the movie a bit more enjoyable. Even more, if it weren't for the part, which presented the stage of preparation for the Games, it would be a pretty decent action movie with some entertaining fighting sequences. I must also say that the movie is well directed and presents some stunning cinematographic achievements in the sense of visual experience. Jennifer Lawrence did well. She is now on the list of many production studios as the new leading female. Because the lack of actual heroine characters in the last few years made her, and the role which she played, appear as a definition of the thing that Hollywood needs – a strong and independent woman that can support a picture on her own. Josh Hutcherson's character – Peeta - was just a supplement. He wouldn't be able to survive without the help of this brave young girl. Don't expect any blood splattering over the bodies of deceased teenagers or gruesome scenes of murder. This is a PG-13 movie. If you want a real survival picture you would be better off watching Battle Royale, a fantastic Japanese flick that presents a similar concept, but with a 100% more violence and ruthlessness. And it goes straight to the point in just a few minutes.All in all, The Hunger Games happened to be exactly what I expected it to be: a movie focused on a group of teenagers, who are in need of yet another teenage drama with a whole lot of heartfelt romance. Watchable, but definitely not a movie for the ages – 5/10.",5,0,2,19 May 2012
Oldboy," A smashing movie that will leave you dazzled
","Being a gripping, thrilling and harrowing tale of revenge, Oldboy attacks the audience with its unsettling atmosphere and graphic scenes of brutality. From the very first minutes the film successfully grasps one's attention and doesn't stop to astound until the final, shocking moments. It's an intriguing, mysterious, and bloody seductive movie, which presents a story so gruesome and unforgiving that it's almost unbearable to watch. When Oh Dae-su is imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons and eventually gets out, he has only two questions in mind: why and who? While trying to capture his oppressors he wants to uncover the real purpose behind this outrageous event that ruined his life for good. With the help of a lovely young girl, he succumbs to the lone warrior's way and finds out more about himself and his life than he intended to. In the film the revenge goes both ways, and as soon as we discover what the whole story is about we won't be able to forget how powerful and, at the same time, discomforting the film really is.Chan Wook Park did an amazing job directing the film, but probably his greatest decision was casting the superb Min-sik Choi in the titular role. His frighteningly beastly attitude serves everyone right, as he defeats his enemy with cold blood and uncovers all the clues one after another, only to arrive at a conclusion that has much to do with a forgotten past. Great entertainment, not for the squeamish.",9,1,7,9 November 2012
My Neighbor Totoro," A thing of beauty
","This is definitely one of those astonishingly high-spirited movies that you can simply sit back and enjoy, mainly due to the heart-warming tale and beautiful animations. Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job, delivering one of the prettiest pictures that any kid or grown-up can love right from the start. One might even say that it is better than classic Disney pictures.It doesn't provide a strong and elaborate storyline, like Princess Mononoke or Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and doesn't imply any moral guidance or specific messages. And that's a very good sign, noting that the movie is supposed to bring out all the positive emotions in the viewer through its magical aura and all those enormously joyful characters and creatures appearing on-screen.Looking at the two young girls, Mei and Satsuki, jumping freely and laughing about no particular things made me want to be a child again. Miyazaki is able to move our minds and make us see that childhood is the most fantastic time of our lives, and being able to use the full potential of one's imagination should be glorified.Even though it has an element of sadness, with the girls' mom staying in the hospital, it is so neatly placed in the storyline that it doesn't spoil the tremendous fun of watching My Neighbor Totoro. It's simply an idyllic tale, accompanied by a taste of magic and fantasy. Tell me, who won't be able to adore those fluffy Totoros and their marvelous abilities? Every time they appeared I wanted them to stay a little longer and mesmerize me with their sparkling glow of glee.The English dubbing is very decent, the voices were chosen appropriately so that they would seem like they were taken straight out of the Japanese version.All in all, I must say that My Neighbor Totoro really tickled my dreams of being a child all over again with its hypnotizing beauty. It was able to show me yet again that the fantastic world of Japanese anime genre has so many wonderful pictures to offer. And if you really want to start your adventure with Miyazaki, I bet that watching this picture will be the best possible way to do so.",8,1,3,5 June 2012
500 Days of Summer," Great, fresh insight into the romance genre
","This is not a love story. That is the warning given to the viewer at the beginning of the movie. And it certainly meets the assumption as we wander deeper and deeper into the complicated relationship of Tom and Summer. He is an idealistic dreamer, who think that in order to achieve happiness he has to fall in love with the one, perfect girl. She happens to be his exact contrary female version - she doesn't believe in happy endings and fairy tales. So how exactly do these two very different people end up being a couple for the eponymous 500 days? For all the lovebirds out there, this could mean that sometimes the exception proves the rule! However, I have to blunt right now - sadly, as the viewer is about to find out, the differences and arising conflicts can only produce a disastrous result and drive two people apart.There are many reasons why I simply fell in love with this picture: it is not a typical movie, due to the fact that it connects some aspects of a typical romance with various features of a down- to-earth drama. This process is best shown through the intersection of parts that show everything in bright and positive colors, with the sun shining and the birds singing, and parts that include rainstorms, dark humor, sad faces and deeply philosophical sentences. This cinematic procedure really invites to get a broader look at this very particular relationship, which can sometimes seem as a smooth and joyful one. And then, just a few seconds later, it provides a scene that changes the perspective 180 degree around.Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. You could certainly see that they had so much fun playing the main parts. What is more, because of the fact that the connection between the two stars carries the whole plot in an amazing fashion, the recognition that they deserve for their wonderful acting should be even bigger.Personally, I am not a big fan of romantic movies, that is why I didn't know what to expect when I started watching (500) Days of Summer. But in the end I was astonished. It provides a new light onto this genre and changes the way we might perceive it. It stand out from the crowd of all those, mostly boring, standard romances and shows that in real life not everybody ends up living happily ever after - sometimes we have to put up a hell of a fight to get closer to a person we admire. And even then, it's a long way home.",8,1,1,6 May 2012
Midnight in Paris," The magic of nostalgia
","Summer is all about traveling to distant places. Summer is all about dreaming of and fulfilling all of the greatest desires. It is also a bit about escaping from the every-day reality of a boring life for even a couple of days. Everyone should do so one in a while. So, what would YOU do if you were able to go to a beautiful place like Paris and discover all of the wonderful and magical attractions that it can offer you?Place yourself in a position of Gil, a struggling Hollywood writer, who flies to Paris on a business trip, along with his girl Inez and her very annoying parents. He needs some inspiration for his next novel, that is why he wants to take a trip around the city and experience it through all of its poetic magnificence. However, in order to do so he has to somehow get rid of his ignorant girlfriend for a while. And it so happens that on one evening she goes dancing with her friends and Gil is left all alone. He finally gets that quiet and peaceful time that he needed so much. And this is when all the magic happens.The whole situation seems to get a little out of control - he walks around town and just as the clock bell rings at midnight the whole reality changes. It's like he accidentally found a place that acts as a time machine and transports you back to the magnificent and artistic 1920's. This is the true beauty of Midnight in Paris. The viewer is able to experience all of the sensations and glamor and bourgeois lifestyle of that era along with Gil and the newly met eccentric woman named Adriana. She introduces him to her extravagant friends, who happen to be the biggest 'stars' in town.I love the portrayal of all the famous people that resided in Paris in that period of the 20th century. When you think about it, during those prominent times you were able to meet many of the greatest artists in the history of mankind on every single corner of the street. I love all of the witty jokes and remarks that they make during meetings with the protagonist. Finally, I love the fact that they actually seemed like they didn't have any problems back then and simply lived for the pure appreciation of life. Amazing.One of the best qualities of this film is the wonderful representation of the classic art deco design of various restaurants and bars, that started to flourish on the Parisian cultural scene in the 1920's.I must say that this is one of the best Woody Allen pictures in years. Apart from many intelligent laughs it addresses one very important message - that all of us sometimes yearn for the times that we didn't live in. It happened to Gil. But it also happened to Adriana, which makes us realize that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. And even though we may think that we don't belong to this particular place and time, we can't be sure if we would be comfortable somewhere else either.One last remark: I can't say that I'm a fan of Owen Wilson's acting career, but he certainly deserves recognition for his performance here. He fits into the role of this clumsy writer, who is also an excessive dreamer, just perfectly. Great job, Mr. Wilson. You just made the romantic Paris look more magical than ever!",8,0,0,9 May 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The most likable criminal couple in film history
","How is it possible that when people hear the word 'western' they immediately think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Well, there are exactly THAT many reasons for this interesting phenomena. Firstly, the stunning directing by George Robert Hill makes it look like an exactly archetypal movie in this specific category. It easily became a smash hit at the box-office in the United States in 1969 and went on to create a major fan base all over the world.Secondly, it offers a spellbinding storyline provided by the great William Goldman. It's packed with everything that can be connected with this most American of all genres: genuine characters, grand wild west feeling, gunfights, train robberies, pretty dames, dangerous enemies, gangs, chases, great adventures, a little romance, a little comedy, etc. Additionally, all the clever dialogues make the movie much more pleasurable and engaging.Thirdly, the cinematography is really incredible, offering the most captivating views of Western American and Bolivian landscapes, which the viewer is able to admire right from the beginning up till the very end. Also, the fantastic shifts in takes from sepia to color in some of the most climatic scenes create a perfect atmosphere.Fourthly, I believe that I didn't mention the two stars, the most memorable couple of gunslingers, train robbers and lawbreakers that ever roamed through the vast American desserts – Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). Based on a real-life pair of criminals, their story is partly true and partly imagined. On the run from the law, the boys decide to hide in Bolivia and start a new career there. Along comes Etta Place (Katharine Ross), Kid's girlfriend. They try to learn Spanish in order to be able to rob banks, but what comes out of this farce looks more like a comedy than serious business. After a series of successes and some misfortunes, they are finally wanted all over the country, like they were in their homeland. In the most gripping, and unforgettable final scene they have to fight with tens of policemen and even though the viewers knows that they are criminal and, thus, should be caught or killed, the way they are portrayed makes it easy to admire those two up-to-no-good characters.Surprisingly, the scene, which stayed in my memory for the longest time, wasn't this one or any other of the fast-action sort – it was the one when Butch was riding on a bike with Etta (accompanied by a beautiful song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'), like they were two innocent kids, strolling around farms, as if nothing really mattered.All of those factors make this movie look special. I won't be original when I say that this is probably one of my favorite western of them all, but that's the truth. No one can deny that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kind will go down in history as one of the finest, most entertaining, and most achieved movies ever.",9,2,4,25 June 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's grand satire on the nuclear war
","Dr. Strangelove is a simply marvelous, absolutely ironical, and very clever satirical take on the possibilities of a nuclear war that might have arisen during the Cold War period. The constant, ridiculous disputes and fights between Americans and 'Ruskis' (as they are called in the movie) contributed to the fact that this movie actually took shape of a most pleasurable caricature of a war film ever.I can only imagine how Stanley Kubrick suddenly realized that the script that he's been working on didn't really present this tremendously serious topic in a totally respectable manner, but absolutely on the contrary – as a genuine parody.It's scary to laugh at such a tragic moment in the history of our world, but the way that Kubrick depicted all the imaginary (thankfully) events that lead on to a prospect of nuclear holocaust is so humorous that no one will be able to suppress laughter. I don't think that any other director will ever be able to do it in such a way that he has. It's hard to imagine the disturbing power of the message that the movie gave to the viewers in the times of its premiere. However, in fact, it may be right to say that people, scared of the concept of another war hanging over their heads, were walking out of the cinemas feeling much more relaxed, after seeing a film so brilliant and bizarre at the same time.There are so many fantastic moments in the film that it would be hard to point out all of them, so I'll just mention some of my favorite: Gen. Turgidson starts a fight with the Russian ambassador and president Muffley says: 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'; Capt. Mandrake trying to call Mr. President, when he doesn't have enough change to put in the phone machine, and asks for a collect call; the shooting of a Coke machine to get some pennies; the ridiculous phone call that Turgidson receives from his mistress during the serious talks in the War Room; Muffley's conversation on the phone with the Russian President; the scene of a soldier bull-riding a nuclear missile shouting 'woo-hoo'; every scene that includes Dr. Strangelove and his disobedient Nazi hand.It's so full of totally humorous and absurd situations, ideas, sequences, notions, connotations, characters that it's simply overwhelming, in the most positive meaning of the word.It's also packed with many splendid performances by a bunch of brilliant actors. Sterling Hayden as the paranoid Gen. Jack Ripper gives an exquisite show, being the one who actually started the whole nuclear mess. Later he tries to persuade his comrades that there is a possibility of a Russian fluoridation scheme to poison the US citizens. George C. Scott as Turgidson, laid back ladies' man and general full of hatred towards 'Ruskis'. But the biggest credit goes to the magnificent Peter Sellers, for his versatile and confident acting as three distinct characters. He is so convincing that it looks as though different actors played all of those parts. It's a shame that the Academy jury didn't award him with an Oscar, because the way that he portrays those three major persons is a standout achievement of his long career.Come to think of it, if all the ideas that's been put out in Dr. Strangelove the world as we now know it probably would not exist. I mean, with all the talks about fluoridation, poisoning, and weapons of mass destruction that would destroy all life on Earth if somebody attacked the Soviet Union, it's hard to stay indifferent to the topic of nuclear disasters. However, as I mentioned it previously, the way that Kubrick was able to present all of the gimmicks is so laughable that it makes all of those notions unbelievable and nonsensical. All of those factors combined make Dr. Strangelove a stop on the filmography road that no one should omit.",9,1,2,12 June 2012
Alien," A remarkable game changer and a stunning sci-fi experience
","An opportunity to watch Alien in the cinema on the day of its premiere, not knowing anything about it prior to the screening, just to be able to experience it in all its suspenseful glory – that would definitely be my biggest wish if I could have one.However, even though most of the mystery behind its thrilling story has been spoiled for me some time before I had a chance to see Ridley Scott's creation, I was still overwhelmed by its unearthliness, and simply left speechless in the end.Probably everything that's to be said about Alien has been said already. The uncontested fact that it's an essential science fiction will remain true throughout the history. Ridley Scott changed to way most people look at this genre and started a trend that many directors wanted to follow. That shouldn't surprise anyone, knowing that a picture like this comes only a few times in the history.The director was capable of creating and developing a frantically majestic universe, in which he placed the whole story about the horrible adventure of the Nostromo mining ship. No one can deny that the method Mr. Scott used to hypnotize the viewers continues to be fresh and very original even now, more than 30 years ago.The masterful editing of the movie creates a visually perfect atmosphere that is able to draw attention and scare in the most stunning, and intelligent way. Combined with the eerie music and the specific, very dark and sombre tone in most of the scenes, they create an unforgettable movie experience.The fact that the extraterrestrial creature, which roams around the ship killing all of the passengers one after another, is shown only for a slight second accounts for the fact that the movie is more fascinating and riveting. It isn't like in most of the horrors that we are used to, where the killer is constantly on-screen, running around and murdering his victims in an absurd manner. No, the way the Alien does it is utterly distinctive. He does it quietly, without any unnecessary exposures. The viewer is waiting for him to show up, but he never does. All we see is the empty corridors, surrounded by a gloomy fog of uncertainty.The seven passengers try everything to get rid of the uninvited guest. Unfortunately, in an encounter with the mysterious monster they are hopeless, and it seems that their ship would be lost in the vast space for all eternity. This is the moment when an unexpected hero emerges. Or a heroine, I should say. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was able to handle the situation, being left alone after all the other crew members have been killed. She stayed put, in control of the situation, and outsmarted the creature in the final sequence.In the person of Sigourney Weaver the world finally got a strong and brave woman, who was able to withhold any devastating circumstances and still fight when all hope seemed to have been lost. Her performance is breathtaking, so real and believable that when she fears for her life every person watching her is scared to death too.The visual and special effects (sadly, the only Oscar that the movie got) are on the highest level all the time - the opening scene showing the enormous universe surrounding Nostromo; when it lands on a distant planet just to discover another life form; during the tantalizing on-board hunt.The scene of a bursting stomach, when a little Alien is born will come down in history as one of the most memorable ever.All in all, the spellbinding atmosphere, the unconventional tone, the remarkable story, the well- developed characters, the unexpected twists, the thrilling suspense, the mystery behind the unknown (the list could just go on and on) – all of those factors put together give reason for calling Alien one of the best science-fiction movies of all times. If you haven't seen it already, do it know.",10,0,1,10 June 2012
The Town," Ben Affleck's directorial win
","The Town is a deliberately old-fashioned, pulpy crime drama that serves its purpose as a romantic heist picture, where character-driven narrative intertwines with many action-packed sequences of utmost suspense. With this film Ben Affleck surely hit a second spectacular home run (right after Gone Baby Gone), assuring that his directorial career will be more rewarding than his acting one. What's surprising is that the story depicted in The Town comes as a rather familiar and simple one, but the way it's presented and acted promises many splendidly entertaining and downright thrilling moments. Right within the first few minutes of the picture the tension mounts to unbearable levels, as a group of masked criminals robs a bank and takes one of the female workers as a hostage. The woman, Claire (Rebecca Hall), quickly becomes the object of interest of the mastermind behind the heist, Doug (Ben Affleck in his most promising role to date). Yet still unknown to her is the fact that Doug was actually the one, who commanded the operation and caused the whole mess. As the two begin their burning love affair, Doug - along with his three partners in crime - plan another dangerous robberies. His sudden affection towards the girl and gradual loss of readiness to go into action makes his partner anxious and relevantly angry. Jem (Jeremy Renner; the guy really had a good few years), his longtime friend and former jailbird is trying to convince him that money is worth more than a girl. Apart from the personal conflicts, Doug is followed closely by a FBI operative Frawley (Jon Hamm), who is eager to put the guys behind bars and stop the Charlestown criminal ring once and for all. Because, after all, it's a business of relationships, and what happens in the family stays in the family. Doug walks a thin line between freedom and imprisonment, and this one final action might be all that he needs to finally take the matters of his life into his own hands.Being a smartly written and captivatingly shot (many great aerial shots of Boston) thriller, The Town brings about all that's best about the genre, without referring to any clichés per se. Through combining its modern, violent crime nature with an appealing 30's vibe, The Town advises the audiences to look closely into the substance of the film and react to a many of the intense and gritty sensations that cleverly fill the core of the film. Every actor has a room to maneuver, and - decidedly so - each and every one of them finds a way to be a considerable part of the whole picture.",8,2,3,18 December 2012
Gone Baby Gone," Ben Affleck, win #1
","Gone Baby Gone achieves a tremendously engaging level of suspense, and does it through the depiction of a perplexing story about a young private detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck in a superb role) , who - along with his partner and lover Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) - takes on a difficult case and tries to find a kidnapped girl. Ben Affleck, never really considered a leading man in the acting business, proved for the first time (and not for the last) that his directorial skills are top notch. His high aspirations make Gone Baby Gone a fresh and entertaining addition to the crime thriller genre. The film takes place in Boston, mostly in its underground world, and does a great job of portraying the twisted mechanism that governs the crime scene and all its members.Enhanced by great supporting performances from Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman - who play the two shady yet plausible Boston area police officers - the cast astounds with an unusually realistic attention to details in the representations of regular working-class folks, who are trapped in an intrigue that's literally making them go insane after only a short period of time. In all its sensational, captivating glory, the story presented in Gone Baby Gone looks as though it's been taken straight out of a newspaper's front page, delivering many real-life moments of pure drama. Apart from depicting the step-by-step investigation, the film also aspires to be a considerable psychological piece, pondering how the mess surrounding the case rebounds on the personal and professional life of the main character. Patrick, giving all that he can in order to discover the truth, begins to doubt his sanity and becomes infuriated with his inability to cope with what's been happening around him.As usual in this kind of movies the truth is hidden several layers deep, and in order to reveal the whole one has to go through a troubling amount of more or less acceptable evidence. Every new and unexpected fact found by Patrick adds up to the masterfully build suspense. Though unmistakably intense and utterly gripping, Gone Baby Gone offers one twist too many and changes its message for a less entertaining, yet still perfectly valuable one. In the world of corruption and hypocrisy nothing is certain, and Ben Affleck's debut feature is not only a taut and downright realistic thriller, it's also a hard-hitting exemplification of all the values that rule this shabby place.",7,0,1,27 December 2012
The Thing," The Thing attacks with its gory visuals
","I must say that after seeing the three brilliant and scary interpretations of John W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?' – 'The Thing from Another World', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'Alien' - I sat on my couch to watch 'The Thing' with a bit of skepticism. However, as I knew that John Carpenter is a cult director in the horror sphere, I was definitely ready for a good scare, filled with a decent level of blood and gore, and maybe not too much of a genuine story.The first thing that the viewer sees is a spaceship traveling in the galaxy near Earth. Fast- forward a few hundred years: Antarctica, exactly in the middle of nowhere. In the enormous amount of pure-white snow, we observe a helicopter coming in the distance, trying to shoot a dog. But why do they want to catch an innocent creature so badly? That we actually won't find out (yet), as the dog runs towards an American station, and after a chaotic couple of minutes and a few gunshots (and dead Norwegians), it is finally safe in the arms of confused Americans.This is the moment when all the fun starts. It's like a game of cat and mice between the 'thing' (no one knows what it truly is, as it is able to morph and take shape of any organism that is nearby) and all the researches. This insatiable creature is able to thaw out at any moment, killing a person, absorbing him and then imitating in the most perfect manner. Nobody can be trusted anymore. The people become overly suspicious and paranoid. And up until the very last moments there aren't any special ways of finding out who is human and who isn't. Unfortunately, the main drawbacks of the movie are the superficial characterization and highly unreal behavior of all the frightened men. Even though they realize that they are in grave danger, they sometimes act as if their main purpose of being inside the base was to actually get attacked from behind and murdered. What's more, at times it's even hard to grasp how many people are actually dead and it somehow takes some of the fun away. Carpenter didn't put a huge emphasis on the portrayal of his characters; he much rather wanted to astound us with the very realistic special and visual effects, which are actually quite scary and gruesome. I mean, even though there are some terrifying scenes of gore and pure repulsion, they probably won't be too expressive for regular viewers (or will they?), and exciting enough to stimulate the blood lust of all the hardcore horror fans. Great music score by Ennio Morricone only increases the mood and the overwhelming suspense of the story.However, even though it has some minor flaws, it still is a great and thrilling picture, and it stand out from the huge crowd of many dull and muddling horrors that came out in the 1980's. Dare to watch The Thing, and it will certainly satisfy all your bloodiest desires.",7,0,2,27 June 2012
American Psycho," Devil inside
","In order to start the review I shall mention that this is truly one of my favorite movies. A personal top 10 list perhaps. I watched it several times and every time I found another moment or scene that made me fall in love once more. That is why I wasn't really able to find any flaws in American Psycho, the gripping tale of a Wall Street yuppie, who turns into a ruthless murderer at night. But that you probably already know. What you may not know is that the amount of blood and gore is on a totally different level that in the book. So if you think that this movie is controversial I advise you to read Bret Easton Ellis' masterpiece. Believe me, you won't regret it. The deep insight into the character's mind and much more brutal descriptions of all sorts of tortures make the movie only a enjoyable complement.This is really the best delusional satire on the Wall Street boom of the 1980's and the presence of a distinct yuppie culture. Every one of the high-positioned businessmen cares only about his looks, bank account and the most expensive food and clothes. Oh, and definitely has no soul whatsoever. No emotional needs. Just look at Bateman. He kills innocent people in order to satisfy his strangest desires and achieve fulfillment. Yet with every killing his cravings become stronger and stronger. He is detached from this world, a true sociopath. But how many of you didn't even once think about killing someone, simply because he did something frustrating? Maybe Patrick is the only one, who is able to present (in a most radical way) his dissatisfaction with humanity and our horrible world. On a totally unrelated topic - how awesome is Christian Bale's as Patrick Bateman? He fits perfectly, with his handsome face, elegance, style, manner of speaking. It's like he was born for that role (and probably for one more - Bat(e)man - notice that this isn't a coincidence). I would also like to mention that the fact that glitz and glamor of Oscar-related greatness passed by American Psycho is a good thing. The movie went on to become one of the most thrilling indie horrors of all time and Bale, being an icon to many, was able to go on working on other great projects without the omnipresent burden of awards.Finally, I would strongly recommend that you watch American Psycho only after reading the book. Then you will be able to appreciate the pure genius of the movie's atmosphere and Bale's acting. It will put a new perspective on your perception of his character. Because, after all, American Psycho is a deeply psychological tale that will keep you focused until the very last minute.",8,0,0,27 April 2012
North by Northwest," A one of a kind Hitchcockian experience
","Having seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's works I must admit that North by Northwest has quickly become my favorite, even though it may not possess the typical Hitchcockian motives. What's more, It could as well be placed in the same box as the James Bond franchise, because it may in some aspects remind of the well-known spy movies (Cary Grant could have been a perfect 007, with his elegance, handsome face and fantastic overall presence). However, I must say that it combines a better-developed structure, more wit in its dialogues and greater suspenseful sequences than any Bond movie does. Also, personally I thought that Eva Marie Saint was much more appealing than all of the Bond girls combined.The main plot introduces the whole movie as a serious and thrilling mystery of a man, who is mistaken for an agent and embarks on a journey to clear his name. Still, apart from that, there are various comedic aspects of the film, along with my favorite scene in the first few minutes, when Roger Thornhill (played brilliantly by Cary Grant) is being held captive, forced to get drunk and then ride a car. As for the romantic section, there is the ongoing chemistry between the devious Eve Kendell and Thornhill.All those aspects make up for an amazing and most enjoyable plot. The ideal mix of all the conjoint, yet rather opposing, factors marks the true genius of the director himself. Even though all of Hitchcock's pictures are undisputed masterpieces, North by Northwest captivated me the most. I haven't really seen a movie that offers so much - perfect plot-subplots combination, intelligent script, memorable scenes, many distinct sceneries, tremendous acting (great supporting roles by James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau) and, most importantly, the building of suspense until the very last minute. It is also the best Hitchcock- Grant collaboration you will find. Even though the picture didn't win an Oscar in any of the three categories that it was nominated in, it surely could have won an Award for the best picture of the year. Or the decade. Or the century. Because every time you watch this fantastic movie you will be able to find a new part that will catch your attention. That is the true genius of Hitchcock. He made a movie that brings out everything that is the greatest about the motion picture industry, that is the ability to develop a masterwork that can be interesting to every single person in the world.",10,2,3,29 April 2012
Edward Scissorhands," Some flaws in the story, but a very powerful message within
","I have always admired the unusual way, in which Tim Burton is able to communicate his opinion on old-as-our-world topics. In Edward Scissorhands he confronts the viewer with the constantly recurring problem of personal alienation and rejection from the society, because of differences that might seem too hard to comprehend or actually too scary for most of the 'normal' people.In the deeply satirical, and highly unconventional manner Burton tries to persuade everyone that good heart and pure kindness won't be enough to be accepted, and that it sometimes takes less than a few minutes to change the way others perceive us. The extraordinary often tends to bore people after a while and they simply throw out human beings like trash bags when they don't need them anymore.With fantastic special effects and spectacular optical illusions Edward Scissorhands is able to astound in the sphere of visual experiences. However, due to some flaws in the storytelling department it is still not such a fine piece of work like Beetlejuice or Batman.In a strangely artificial world, where all houses are painted in high-contrast pastel colors, and people wear deliciously ugly and glaring uniforms, there is also a place for a gloomy 'haunted' house standing on a hill. The only person that occupies it is a boy named Edward. Because of the death of his creator, a mad scientist (Vincent Price), he is left with pairs of huge temporary scissors instead of hands. Ono one shiny day one of the loony housewives, Peg (Dianne West), who lives in the city with her husband, son and daughter, comes knocking on his door, and after just a few moments she decides to take him home. In a community, where everybody is nearly as weird as Edward is, people don't find him strange or frightening. What's more, they are truly amazed by his fantastic abilities, namely the special gift of forming beautiful figures in bushes and ice blocks, and turning regular haircutting into an art form. He is glorified by the local news channels and loved by all the creepy ladies. He is the talk of the town, a one of a kind 'toy' that brings so much fun into this bizarre scenery. There is even some place for romance between him and Kim (Winona Ryder), the family's daughter. However, as it always happens, there are some people who don't appreciate an eccentric man with scissors as his fingers running around posing as a proper citizen. Soon, after a series of unlucky events, Edward is wrongly accused of breaking into a house and all of the fame and love starts to fade away as quickly as it came. And even though what happens next to Edward is truly sad and unfair, the ending is merely as predictable and Hollywood-like. Hard-pressed and angered, the main character is forced to resort to violence and kill the oppressing forces.The collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is nearly as perfect as ever. Without the fantastic character that they both created the movie wouldn't ever be as watchable as it is now. Depp shines on-screen, other characters maybe not so much, but what counts is that through this bizarre and visually impressive movie Burton was able to spread out the word about discrimination and loneliness in the most peculiar, yet really admirable way.",8,0,0,28 June 2012
The Intouchables," A touching and laughable French hit
","Intouchables is probably one of the best French movies of the last few decades. It's not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in Europe, and now it's creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the United States. It's so utterly pleasurable and heart-warming. Don't look at it as a foreign feature, though, or you will miss ale the excitement. It's a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember. Films like this one don't come out too often these days, so just sit back and enjoy it while it's still out on the big screen.Intouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older, extremely rich, but severely paralyzed white man and a black man, who just got out of prison. Philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as Omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role. The plot doesn't concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time, but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other. It was as if they were meant to work together and, in the process, become 'intouchable', in a very profound meaning of the word, and inseparable by any outer force. It's fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together. Even though at first it might seem that Omar may be overly vulgar, disrespectful, ignorant, and simply inadequate for this hard job, Philippe is still eager to give him a chance. What's more, many of Philippe closest friends don't approve of his new companion, but that doesn't discourage him.It is simply remarkable, how Omar is able to bring warmth, enthusiasm, and so much fun into Philippe's life. They actually operate on the same wavelength, as it might seem, sharing the same views and opinions on various topics. Through Omar Philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing, as if nothing really mattered, even if you are attached to a wheelchair.And with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message, showing that all the wealth and money isn't capable of making a man truly happy, when he doesn't have someone to share it with. It's the richness in heart and mind that really matters, not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power.Through his brilliant, funny, and very real performance, Omar Sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start. He is able to show the transition that his character goes through, from a cold man living on the streets, to a deeply compassionate and art-loving protector, in the most convincing manner.The amount of clever, laughable, and sometimes insulting (but timed very adequately) jokes is simply overwhelming. Also, notice the amazing mix of classic music and 60's soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters.I don't think that if someone would've come to me with a script and said: 'Listen, I got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed' I would've bought it.It's a simple exaggeration, but through that straight statement I want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer, making the marvelous Intouchables a true stand-out movie of the last few years. Highly recommended.",8,3,6,15 June 2012
Drive," A stand-out movie of the year
","In the vast sea of terrible and completely superfluous movies that premiered in 2011 Drive comes as a brilliant independent freshener of the highest sort. It's 80's-like aura, connected with a strong plot, mesmerizing soundtrack and convincing main character, provide for a pleasant, yet somehow unexpectedly thrilling, amount of adrenaline flow. Nicolas Winding Refn took a risky step in mixing a bit of old-school gangster cinema with a contemporary movie about dangerous and hot car rides. I must say that the outcome is more enjoyable than it sounds at first.Unexpected as it may seem, it's Ryan Gosling's time to shine in Drive. The whole plot is generally build on his performance, and it's worth stressing out that his ability to support the picture with his persona and make it look very professional is outstanding. I've never considered him to be a leading man of our generation, but after this movie he really showed the world that his days of glory are only about to begin. The nonchalance of The Driver, as he is known, his eagerness to be very quiet, blended with brutal outbursts in the most promising moments makes him a man everyone should be scared of. I mean, when a guy puts a nail to your head and threatens to push it right through your head with a hammer sounds kind of extreme, right?Carey Mulligans brings a dose of realism to the picture, playing a person so vulnerable, yet so positive in her perception of the brutal emptiness that surrounds her, because of the delinquent husband. His ties to the criminal underworld are the main reason that The Driver suddenly becomes a first-rate offender in the mafia community. I truly adore the seemingly noir atmosphere that can be felt throughout the whole time. The visually suspenseful sequences, collided with the harshly dark tone of the colors, and gripping storyline can partially remind of the good old days of brilliant crime thrillers. Maybe if it wasn't for the stupendous bloody scenes of utmost brutality, perhaps.Then, on the other hand, there are a lot of melancholic moments of utter calmness and tranquility that, along with gorgeously placed songs (my favorite being Nightcall), give a completely different side of the picture. All of those factors combined provide for a cinematic experience that certainly most people won't forget. Drive is a smart thriller of our times that, in the huge crowd of rather tedious movies, may be even called a Scorsese for the modern generation. And that's probably a complement that anyone would want to hear.",8,1,3,30 May 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," Bank robbery - reality TV style
","A unique and deeply emotional drama, which shows a bank robbery gone awry. The movie's great tension comes from the fact that even though it has a time span of only few hours, the mood changes constantly as the exposure of the character's inner fears and needs gradually comes to fruition. Al Pacino is great as the clumsy, yet determined bank robber, who became sort of a celebrity through all his wrongdoings. While the robbery doesn't go as planned, Sonny slowly shows his true self, as his insatiable desire to become a star exceeds the urge to steal the money. Unfortunately, his friend Sam isn't as strong and charismatic. He starts to crack, and feels weaker and weaker every minute, and wants for this nightmare to end. And it ends, but not nearly as perfect as the boys imagined. A clever play on clichÃ©s, with an emphasis put on the society's reaction to a horrible event, which actually comes as more entertaining that harrowing in the final evaluation. An iconic movie, supported by electrifying performances by Al Pacino and John Cazale. A bank robbery that turned out to be a reality show for the masses. Intriguing.",8,0,1,18 September 2012
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacular (but also very sad) show !
","Even though I'm not a big fan of musicals, I must definitely say that Moulin Rouge! is a very unconventional movie, when it comes to this specific genre, and with that it immediately caught my attention. Even though it tells a truly saddening story, it's mostly presented in a very joyful manner, with spectacular performances and great dance-and-sing acts.Christopher, a young English writer, arrives in Paris in order to follow the Bohemian Revolution that started in the city's underground world. However, after he is introduced to the prostitute and drug infested community things start to spiral out of control. He meets a beautiful courtesan Satine and deep affection soon follows. The romance takes a hold of this young couple, but nothing can be complete without a few problems on the road. Mainly, the Duke, the sponsor of the whole play, has a thing for Satine too. And in order for the great performance to come to fruition she has to stop running around with Christopher and give in to Duke's filthy desiresIt's amazing that through this simple story Baz Luhrmann is able to depict the harsh truth about our lives. Even if we love someone dearly and with all our hearts, there can always be someone to stand in our way. Someone richer and more powerful and who is actually able to buy his dreams instead of working to achieve them. And even being able to withhold this obstacle may be not enough, as the movie sadly shows.Funny thing is that the first 15 or 20 minutes make an impression that the movie is going to be weirdly psychedelic. The use of light, colors, fast camera movements and, most of all, eerie characters, provide for an unforgettable experience. Still, a few moments later there is a sudden change of pace and the movie takes on a new turn to make it more dramatic. And this is a recurring motive in this picture.The music in Moulin Rouge is very enjoyable and fun to listen, due to many very clever mash- ups of famous songs by world-renown artists, including Madonna, Queen, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe and even Nirvana. The versions written for Moulin Rouge! give those songs a brand new twist, and are actually very entertaining.The movie also makes a great use of various camera techniques, especially of regular close close-ups and numerous swirls and spins, to give the picture an avant-garde feeling.Great acting by young Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is the true quality, which shapes the overall appearance of this film. There are some fantastic (and erotic) sequences that may deliver many laughs. However, the scene, which represents the brilliance of these two actors, is contained in the big finale - the great and fabulous theatrical show, which ends in a huge tragedy. There aren't many pictures, where you'll find such a passionate scene of unbearable and tragic loss, accompanied by such loud cries of helplessness. A true tearjerker.Overall, I would like to say that it is definitely a movie worth watching, and as a proof of it look at the trend that may be observed throughout the first decade of the 21st century: after Moulin Rouge!'s success many musical features started appearing all around the world. And they still are. That's the power of this film.",7,0,0,13 May 2012
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A masterpiece for all generations
","Note: I am referring here to the original version of the movie, not the poor one called Warrior of the Wind available on video. Therefore, I strongly suggest that you should watch only the real edition of Nausicaä.Even though Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind came out a year before the emergence of Studio Ghibli and is not officially accredited as their production, it was later considered as the movie, which actually began the rise of this accredited Japanese animation studio.At first, Hayao Miyazaki created the fantastic post-apocalyptic manga of the same name. After he saw that people were so captivated by it, he decided to turn it into an animated film. It was his first full-length movie, and it decidedly started a marvelous career of this guru of the animation genre.It has it all: beautiful, sweeping, colorful and detailed animation, interesting, complex, and engaging storyline, worthwhile and well-developed characters, impressive visuals, and a complex and serious message.The story happens in a distant future in a world, which was greatly destroyed by the war named Seven Days of Fire. It created a Toxic Jungle, in which strange creatures reside, and where everything is poisonous and thus deadly. There are only a few places left, where it is possible for humans to live, one of them being the titular Valley of the Wind. This is the home of Nausicaä, the peace loving, empathic, lovable, brave, and overly compassionate princess. It's also a place that looks soothingly peaceful, where people seem cheerful and hospitable. However, one day they are attacked by a group of Tolmekians, who plan on destroying the forest and exterminating all the mutants. They take the princess and a few hostages and take off. This is where Nausicaä's grand adventure starts, as she realizes that she might be the only person, who actually cares for the forest and its inhabitants, and knows that damaging their land will only have disastrous effects on the remaining Valleys.Nausicaä is a true heroine that the anime genre deserves. She is a strong and talented warrior, but she doesn't use her powers in the wrong way. Quite the contrary, she not only wants to help her race, but also fights in order to protect the creatures, which seem lethal to regular people. She uses her powerful gift of communicating with the monsters in a proper way, and doesn't even seek revenge after her father's brutal murder.It's a movie, which definitely wasn't designed only for children, as some may claim. It's really a first rate entertainment for the whole family, and everyone would be able to take something very personal out of it.I must say that I'm very impressed (as always in Studio Ghibli productions) by the creativity of the writers and animators. They created so many original, interesting, and outstanding fantastical creatures and monsters. And from the very first moment when you look at them you know that they all come from the hands of crafty Japanese animators.In the English version the dubbing, which features a few notable American actors, is actually good and doesn't downgrade the, so to say, Japanese-ness of the movie.All in all, I must admit that I fell in love with Nausicaä after the first time I saw it. It took me some time to find the real version, but you can only imagine my satisfaction after I finally laid my hands on it. It's a breathtaking movie, with an inspiring tale and genuine characters. If you want to get to know Hayao Miyazaki start from here, and you definitely won't regret it.",9,1,2,20 June 2012
Pi," Aronofsky's tale of obsession and mathematical patterns
","Pi is definitely one of the most remarkable achievements in the world of indie productions. On such a low budget (mere 60 thousand dollars) Darren Aronofsky was able to create an intelligent, engaging, mathematically overflowing movie that stands out in comparison to all the blockbusters that came out in 1998. It is a thorough study of madness and chaos, two strategically opposing matters, yet so closely connected in the film's storyline. The main character believes that when he will finally discover and establish a special pattern, which can be found in nature, he will be able to control simply anything, and the pure reason for our existence will be revealed. It's a risky game, where there are only rights and wrongs, nothing in between. The main character – Maximilian Cohen – is an obsessive-compulsive, frightened, and detached from community, man. He barricades himself from the world in his own apartment, filled with computers. His mind is gradually imploding, due to reoccurring headaches and paranoid visions that attack him in various, random moments. His only friend is an old mathematician, a mentor, with whom he plays a fantastic Japanese game called Go (the sequences remind me of the thrilling book 'The Master of Go' by Yasunari Kawabata).Max's problems begin when two groups try to seduce him, in order to acquire a bit of that genius, which lies inside his troubled mind: A Wall Street firm on one side, and Hasidic Jews on the other. He is looking for a 216-digit number, which will bring enormous wealth for the former, and shine a new light on the understanding of religion for the latter.The film is shot in a very unconventional manner, mostly in black and white (kind of a neo-noir feel), with the use of a, so-called, chestcam (camera attached to the body of an actor), which improves the connection between the character's actions and the viewer's perception of them. Great music only increases the pace and plays very well with the scenes of precise mathematic divagations.Even though the movie's storyline is strictly connected to the brilliant mathematic ideas and notions, it can be certainly called a thriller. Max is in danger all the time, risking his precious mind in order to pursue an obsession. He can't trust anyone, as the people surrounding him don't care about him as a person, but only about what's in his head. He becomes angrier and angrier every minute, and gradually creates his own demise.Pi is Aronofsky's fantastic debut, and a movie that through the complicated (but easy to follow for the regular viewer) mathematical problems and expressions is able to depict a tragic story about mental obsession. I would recommend it to anyone, whether a math geek or a theoretical newbie.",8,0,1,27 June 2012
Grave of the Fireflies," So sad, yet so visually stunning
","Grave of the Fireflies came as a real shocker in the times, when Japanese animation studios produced tons of rather 'interesting' material, such as erotic and brutal anime, cartoons about robots and the supernatural, or simple heart-warming tales for children.Isao Takahata was able to create a truly tragic tale about how two young siblings struggle to survive during the War, but present it in such a way, that may be very easily called beautiful, in its own subtle sense. I mean, the visual side of this animated picture is so stunning that even time doesn't concern it. It looks as fresh in 2012 as it did when it first came out in 1988.Even though the depicted story happens on the eve of World War II, it doesn't actually present the disastrous effects that it had on the Japanese community as such. It's rather a tale of lost youth, and how the overwhelming cruelty and hatred can affect children and change their peaceful lives into a living hell. Those harmful and pure little creatures are afflicted by the selfish conflicts of grown-ups in the most striking way, and that shall be the power of the message that the movie provides.The film starts with a scene that actually indicates how this gruesomely sad story will end. Setsuko is dying on a railway station and nobody cares to help him. After a while he is reunited with his little sister as a ghost. He is now the narrator and we see the whole picture through the eyes of his vivid memories. From now on every sequence accompanied by a flaming red aura is the one, where out of this world experiences melt with reality.From the moment their mother died after an air raid, Setsuko and Seita are left totally alone in this vicious battle for survival. With nowhere else to go they decide to stay in their aunt's house. However, as we quickly find out, she isn't very happy about that and she does almost everything to discourage the kids and thus delicately persuade them to work and earn money for their own food, or simply leave her house.After discovering an abandoned shelter nearby they realize that the only wise choice is to move there and strive to endure on their own terms. Unfortunately, as they soon find out, it isn't easy in these hard war times. They can't work, their money supply is about to end, they don't have anything to exchange, and they're soon accused of stealing crops. What's more, Seita is getting weaker every day, because of malnutrition. The situation seems really terrible. How can two innocent kids be able to get along without any support?The sudden transition that Setsuko and Seita undergo is presented in a very realistic manner. It's very rare to see such a truthful representation of a child's suffering and agony in a movie, much less in an animated production. Their emotions are very real. The way they gradually learn to understand their situation is convincing, and most saddening.I previously mentioned that the movie could certainly be called a thing of beauty, due to its perfect visual presentation. Here's why: it's somehow idyllic, because even though there are signs of war everywhere around (the sirens, air raids, burnt houses and corpses), most of the time we see the two main characters staying in a dream-like hideout place, surrounded by untouched nature and jolly fireflies. In those (very brief) moments when they tend to forget about their problems, it is as if the viewer suddenly changed the movie for a more joyful one. But then the mood changes 180 degrees and we are back in the horrible times of war.Most people like to call the movie a tearjerker, and this statement can't be undermined. But there can also be a different approach to The Grave of the Fireflies. As much as heartbreaking and mournful it is, Isao Takahata shows that even an anime movie can be as graphic as a feature film. It's not easy to watch the story, but it's enormously pleasant to watch the movie. Those are two different things. And this achievement should put a smile on the face of any movie fanatic.",9,1,2,6 June 2012
Clash of the Titans," There are better mythology titles, really
","As much as I like movies that are connected to the great Greek mythology, this is certainly not one of them. I can't compare it to the original version, because as of today I haven't seen it yet. But I definitely can say that Clash of the Titans (3D) is a barbaric carnage on the group of films that are set in the times of gods, heroic warriors, and ancient empires.The storyline is childish, but what more can you expect from a typical popcorn flick brought to life in order to please the masses, right? Right. The demigod Perseus, son of Zeus, has to stop Hades from releasing the Kraken, which will destroy the town of Argos. He gathers a team of brave, strong and handsome soldiers, who will accompany him on his nearly impossible mission. At first, there seem to be no chances of stopping the beast. However, as the time passes the team realizes that there is one way to defeat the monster, but it requires a trip into the deepest parts of the underworld, namely the palace of Medusa, and cutting her head off. As expected, at the end of the journey only a few men survive; just to make the tale look more dramatic. I think I don't have to mention how the whole story ends, as it clearly speaks for itself.Actually, from the whole movie the only scene that I was really able to call enjoyable, was the one, where Perseus's entourage had to fight with the nasty Medusa, and one by one got turned into stones. Simple, yet somehow very entertaining while one watches it in 3D.Oh yes, as for the special effects. The CGI crew did a pretty decent job of creating all the monsters and beasts for this feature. They aren't too simple and as of first sight, they don't look too computer-ish. The battle sequences would have been boring if it wasn't for the third dimension's visual experience. They look very spectacular sometimes. This is one of a few positive aspects of the movie, for sure.Sam Worthington as a demigod? Who knew? He actually has the ability to make his character credible, with all the fantastic combat skills and mighty words that he speaks. But Ralph Fiennes was seriously better off playing Voldemort.As of now, you aren't probably able to see the movie in the cinemas anymore. So the 3D opportunity is gone. If you have a TV compatible with 3D glasses, and are in the mood for some brainless action movie, than I say go watch it, just for fun. Otherwise, I say don't, it isn't worth your time.",6,0,1,17 May 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," An intergalactic beauty
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a remarkable achievement in the field of visual effects and film editing. It's not just a movie - it's an example of art of the highest sort. People are often mislead by its slow pace, lengthy sequences, very little action and confusing themes. But that's the true beauty of this masterpiece. I don't think that there will ever be another picture so innovative, not on the technical level, but on the ideological one. It's surely an epic drama about adventure and exploration. But it's also much more than that. It's truly overwhelming what this 2-hour long feature can say through the magnificent images that appear on screen not only to astound us, but to make us realize that there is so much more to life than we already know.Taking into account that it's been released in 1968 it should be considered as a fundamental science fiction movie, not only because of its staggering beauty and profound outer-space experiences, but also because of the ideas that's been implemented in this highly metaphorical and philosophical creation.Stanley Kubrick directed a movie that probably has thousands of various interpretations. And people are coming with new ones every day. From connections to Nietzschean ideologies about the potential of mankind, through references to religious content, up to the theory of conception, which regards the basis of human evolution that's featured in the film and endures within all of the succeeding chapters.The reappearance of the mysterious black monolith only makes the movie more puzzling and interesting, so to say. The viewer doesn't necessarily discover its true meaning, but one can only imagine that it serves as a prominent link in the humanity's evolutionary tale.It's really fascinating how all of the chapters connect in a clear and expressive manner. It all starts with the Dawn of Mankind, where a tribe of apes finds the black monolith for the first time, and suddenly realizes how to use weapons, in order to win over the precious territory. A quick throw of a bone into the air and we're in the vast space, a few million years into the future. That's where the mystique adventure happens, and all that people know about the universe is about to change completely.I have to say that my favorite character of all is HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). Even though he is just a computer, he is somehow able to form emotions, and thus, paradoxically, it may be said that he is the most human of all the crew members of Discovery One. Even though he tries to eliminate all of the other passengers, he is just doing it to protect himself and the whole Jupiter mission. When it comes to visual effects, the most groundbreaking part of it occurs in the fourth part, during the Star Gate sequence. Through merging various colors, patterns, drawings, photographs, and high-contrast images Kubrick produced a thing of utmost beauty. It also formed a basis for the sci-fi movies that started to emerge in the following years. 2001: A Space Odyssey might shock you, confuse you, or even disturb you by the story that it depicts. However, it's truly a breathtaking movie, one that can be viewed as an intergalactic opera, perhaps. So get ready and prepare for one of the most divine shows that you will ever see.",9,0,2,18 June 2012
Sinister," Surprisingly, Sinister is a very satisfying horror flick
","Without giving away too much of the plot, I would like to explain why Sinister might arguably be by far one of the most rewarding, and – at the same time – one of the least offensive horrors of the last year. While the fact that the main idea presented in the film is sometimes poorly executed is rather discouraging, I think that Sinister is able to overcome many of its mistakes in a rather successful fashion.First of all, I loved the way Sinister played with the concept of snuff films, making them one of the scariest and most shocking images seen during the whole movie. They add the much- needed amateurishness, so to say, and show a darker, more sinister side of the picture. Without any hesitation, they attack the audience with obscure recordings of some grizzly murders that look as disturbing and realistic as they definitely should.Second of all, the amazingly climatic music sets the mood just right for a series of abrupt and unexpected scares. These aren't just some silly cookie cutters, no. It's rather a blend of electronic tunes and an a bunch of raw sounds combined together to intensify the unnerving and sombre ambiance every time something frightening and otherworldly is about to happen.Third of all, Sinister doesn't overuse the idea of paranormal activity and nightmarish creatures as such. The weird 'thing' (too stay spoiler-free) is there, yes, but it appears only a few times in order to implement the possibility of an some mystic, occultist presence. Even though the film ultimately fails to get rid of most of its clichés, they're not really that striking and don't downgrade the overall experience. Surprisingly, even the ending is as satisfying as it is abrupt and forced.Unfortunately, the characters are rather superficial and one-dimensional, and their inability to think clearly is the film's biggest problem. For a (un) trained eye the plot might seem predictable after some time, but the people involved in the whole horrendous intrigue can't comprehended that they're in grave danger, and that moving to a house, where people got killed before isn't always a reasonable thing (the blame is on Ethan Hawke's characters, just to be clear).Sinister gives a reasonable amount of scares (although sometimes I wished for some more), and does so through a successful use of violent snuffs, grim and claustrophobic cinematography, and aforementioned distressing soundtrack. Even though Sinister doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's both an eerie and enjoyable addition to the horror genre.",7,1,2,24 November 2012
Groundhog Day," A movie that you might consider re-watching
","Groundhog Day is a perfect movie to watch during a rainy evening, while sitting on a cozy couch, covered with a warm blanket, and with a bag of popcorn in hand. It's a well-structured comedy offering many laughs, with a decent plot, which doesn't necessarily involve a lot of thinking.Phil (Bill Murray), a tired and self-centered weatherman, goes on a trip to Punxsutawney (fancy name I must say), Pennsylvania, in order to cover a story of the infamous Groundhog Day celebrations that take place there every year. Along with him come an irritated cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and a pretty newbie producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). It seems like it will be just another one-day excursion, just to inform people about another useless festivities that involve a groundhog predicting the coming of spring. However, due to horrible weather conditions the trio has to settle down in the city for another night. And then the strangest thing happens. Phil wakes up to the same radio announcements; sees exactly the same view outside his window; gets the same greetings from a hotel lady. And soon discovers that Groundhog Day is going to take place all over again, and again, and againSo why not take advantage of this bizarre situation? At first, he attempts to live his life to the fullest, letting go of all the greed, selfish desires, and sexual temptations. By spending this one particular day anew he gets to know every single person in this small town, and is able to profit from all the information acquired. He also tries to get closer to Rita but fails miserably. That's phase one.In phase two, Phil realizes (after falling off a cliff in a car) that he became immortal somehow and won't die. So he tries to commit suicide in every possible way and still wakes up at 6 a.m. in the same bed listening to a song by Sonny & Cher. He starts to feel miserable and tired of all the mess that he's in. And then comes phase three. He once again wants to seduce Rita. He gets to know her better day after day, in order to finally be able to sleep with her. However, as convincing as he may be, she still rejects him after all. The ultimate way to make her fall in love with him is through good deeds. After all that time he understands that by being altruistic and helpful towards other people goes a road to a woman's heart.The main quality of the movie is contained in its ability to show mostly the same sequences all over again (well, that's what it's all about), but do it in such a manner that isn't boring or dull. Even though it's the same day, the events, actions, and people that the viewer sees are different or presented in an alternative manner. This is probably one of Bill Murray's funniest roles. I always admired his passion for acting, and in Groundhog Day he is convincing enough to say that he might as well play in joyful comedies, as in respectable dramas. His performance makes the movie much more pleasurable, as we are able to look at the transformation of his character and the gradual changes that he goes through from point A (destroy, burn, steal) to point B (love, care, understand). All in all, I won't say that Groundhog Day is my favorite comedy, but it definitely showed me that even some light-hearted comedies are able to pass a meaningful message to the world, and at the same time, make you laugh at the ridiculousness of their storyline.",7,1,3,10 June 2012
Dark Shadows," An enjoyable vampire feast
","'Too many dull and hideous vampire movies are being produced these days'. Said one of the moviegoers sitting behind me. 'Tim Burton better deliver'.I could really understand why he was so irritated. The waves of movies (and TV shows) about vampire-ish creatures of any kind attack us from everywhere all year long. I wouldn't mind if they were even half as good as old Nosferatu (1922) or Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi. The thing is, though, that vampires nowadays tend to be, how should I say, too pretty and shiny. They do not resemble the archetypal monster that was able to scare people away with a single look.However, taking into consideration that Dark Shadows is based on a fantastic TV series (which aired from 1966 to 1971), and that it's built on collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I thought that this might finally be a vampire picture worth watching.Even though it doesn't actually share any similarities with the classic horror show, it still is an enjoyable movie in its own Burton-y style. The art direction, costumes, make-ups and sets are spectacular, as always. In its visual sense it's definitely a thing of beauty. Unfortunately, it lacks a bit in its storyline. The beginning is very promising, but it becomes less and less engaging as it runs towards those important, but not very promising, final minutes.It starts off with a fine introduction of Barnabas Collins' (Depp) teenage years in a wealthy estate of Collinwood, and shows us why he had been turned into a vampire in the first place. We find out about the love that he lost, because of an overly jealous woman called Angelique (Eva Green). She was also responsible for putting him into a coffin buried deep in the ground.Fast-forward 200 years. The Collinwood Manor is now a ruin occupied by Barnabas' distant relatives, including the family's fortune-keeper Elizabeth (Pfeifer), useless brother Roger (Miller), his grieving son David (McGrath), and a chilled-out 15-year-old Carolyn (Moretz). There is also the live-in psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Carter) and a drunken servant Willie (Haley). And how can I forget about the old lady that actually doesn't say a word, but steals every scene that she's in (the whole audience was laughing so hard every time she appeared). After an accidental turn of events Barnabas is finally freed from his horrible trap and returns to the old house with a bang. I must say that with the minute Johnny Depp arrived on the screen again with his pale-as-a-wall face the movie become much more entertaining. The enjoyment he shows when he examines the marvelous architecture and décor of the Manor is so expressive and funny, that it provides for some of the best scenes of the film. That, and also his utter fascination with everything 1970's- style, like a Big McDonald's sign or a lava lamp (it sure looks like blood in a urine).The burning scenes of fiery flirtations between Angelique and Barnabas show that even the undead are able to give out some of the hottest 'cadaverous cold' love-making sequences of the past few years. All in all, I have to say that Tim Burton was once again able to make a movie that can yield a huge amount of laughs from the viewer. Even though Dark Shadows doesn't measure up to pictures, such as Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, it still shows a fair amount of potential in its ability to grasp one's attention. And Johnny Depp's acting, as the dignified and totally classy vampire (more Dracula, less Edward Cullen), is as neat and pleasurable as always.",7,1,3,4 June 2012
1408," Not your average horror movie
","At first I must warn you – if you are looking for a good visual scare this will film definitely disappoint you. However, if you want to watch a well-structured thriller based on a bestseller written by Stephen King you have come to the right place. I surely wouldn't categorize this movie as a horror, because it isn't as much about scaring the audience, as it is about presenting an insight into the darkest parts of a human mind. The fear accumulating in the picture is expected to come from the protagonist, not from the viewer. That is probably why people are often misjudging the whole idea of this highly intelligent plot. A fearless writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack's great role), who specializes in debunking myths about various ghost-houses around the world, is sent to a seemingly regular Dolphin Hotel in New York to write another one of his stories. After acquiring information about the infamous room 1408, where several people had died throughout the years, he sends himself on a mission to clear the paranormal paranoia that surrounds this peculiar place. After ignoring all the warnings from the Hotel's manager (played by Samuel L. Jackson) he finally arrives in the room. Even though at first it seems that this is just another one of those tales created by some attention seekers, strange events start taking place. Writer's skepticism begins to fade away as he unravels more and more mysterious happenings occurring in 1408 (flood coming out of a painting on a high floor of a hotel? You got it).Here I would like to specify that the events I'm talking about aren't just some easy-to-explain creations, designed by human hands. Mike certainly wouldn't fall for that, he is just too experienced. These strange tools of fear are developed by his mind, and through his own life stories. How else would you explain the fact that his late father and daughter suddenly appear inside the Hotel? His deepest and most intimate memories materialize in order to mess with his mind at an enormous pace. Unfortunately, there is no escape now. The door is closed. The phone isn't working. The clock is ticking. It seems that the room disappeared from the material world. The only person that he may be able to rely on is Lily, his wife, with whom he didn't have contact since the death of their daughter. She may be the key to his freedomAt one point in time you are sure that he somehow managed to escape, only to discover a few minutes later that this bizarre journey is about to start all over again. Has Mike lost his mind? Definitely. Even the toughest adventure hunters have their limits. What he saw in this hell of a place exceeded all his expectations. And it will exceed yours too. It will play with your emotions and make you realize that every one of us has that certain part of life that he would prefer to be long forgotten.",8,5,6,1 May 2012
Blade Runner," Ridley Scott's breathtaking look into the future
","First of all, I must mention that I strongly urge you to watch Blade Runner Director's Cut, as it doesn't include the distracting and unnecessary narration, and offers a truly great ending, one that's in adequate correlation with the tone and character of the whole picture. I have always admired Ridley Scott's uncanny abilities that allow him to create an intangible idea of a distant universe in his own mind and then recreate it as a directorial masterpiece. Even though that the world presented in Alien and the one shown in Blade Runner are different, they connect in an apparent manner, which instantly makes the viewer realize that this is precisely Scott's outstanding creation.After a spectacular introduction to a cyber-punk Los Angeles of the 2019, the viewer is quickly drawn into a fantastic sci-fi plot, made up of the smallest, most gripping details. The beauty of this film lies in the fact that it's mainly the intelligent idea that builds up this thrilling story, not spectacular battles, special effects, or unreal creatures.Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced to start a dangerous mission, which involves hunting replicants, human clones that got out of control somewhere in the process and must be terminated immediately (a nice swap for the word 'kill', I must say). As the viewer roams around the city with Deckard, he is introduced to some of the most brilliant minds, and some of the most devious characters, that combine to make an utterly impetuous mix of views and prospects. Deckard is able to hunt down all of the four clones that are running on the city's territory, but before he is be able to finally get rid of them he is taken on a tantalizing ride of a lifetime, one that will change his opinion about the situation of the entire human kind. And the viewer comes along, able to enjoy the magnificent landscape of LA of the future (note, it's not hard to notice the resemblance pictured in The Fifth Element).Harrison Ford definitely in one of his best roles, as a seemingly lifeless man, who somehow manages to change his attitude during the assignment and realize that not only is he about to become a sort of redemption for the town and its community, but also that he may find true love along the way.The whole meaning and complexity of the storyline is implicated with various philosophical references and penetrating implementations of scary visions, which may actually come to life one day. All of this is strengthen with the masterful play on vividly sombre tone, visual experiences, eerie background music, and characteristic atmosphere that surrounds us all the time. And paradoxically, the slow sequences that emerge sometimes are actually only increasing the pace.The final confrontation between Rick and Roy (Rutger Hauer), the strongest and most intelligent of the replicants bunch, is just a cherry on top, so to say. It's definitely one of the best duels in the history of movies (the moment, when he breaks Rick's fingers in an act of revenge - probably one of the most memorable scenes ever). At the right moment, we discover that even Roy is capable of developing some human emotions, which leads to a very interesting and surprising conclusion.All in all, it's safe to say that Blade Runner is one of the most magnificent and clever science- fiction movies ever created. It's deep message, fascinating cinematography, and strong storyline will astound everyone. I highly recommend it.",9,2,6,7 June 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's most heartwarming picture
","Given its highly fanciful aura and bizarrely original storyline, Moonrise Kingdom is arguably the most charming and expressive film directed by Wes Anderson. This visually stunning picture casts an enchanting spell on the viewer, pulling him deep into the picturesque universe where even the seemingly insignificant events are the key to a happy ending. Wes Anderson applies the usual palette of extraordinarily vivid color compositions, making this eccentric rom-com drama look more like a dream-based sequence, explained by a highly creative child.The viewer gets acquainted with the setting of the picture through a short yet insightful introduction made by an unidentified man in a quirky red hat (a homage to The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou): this is the island of New Penzance, and the year is 1965. The film follows closely the adventures of two teenagers, Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), as they embark on a journey, which might seem like a sort of a desired rebirth for them, but ultimately brings chaos into the lives of all the adults that take part in the story. The two main characters, deeply in love with each other, long for solitude, somewhere far away from all the real-life problems that made their lives truly miserable. Sam is a socially awkward, orphaned 'Khaki Scout', and Suzy is a depressed girl who strikes as a totally unemotional figure, but through her behavior it's actually easy to register what goes on in her mind. Love is what brought them together some time ago, and love is what made them consider running away from homes as the means to fulfillment. Unfortunately, this drastic decision disturbed the idyllic society of New Penzance, causing an island-long search carried out by a bunch of radically unbalanced people. There's Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton), police captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), Suzy's parents Walt (Bill Murray) and Laura (Frances McDormand) among others. In the midst of this ridiculous investigation, all the adults actually expose their own grand problems in the process. The dialogues between them are as sharp and angry, as they are actually sophisticated to say the least. What's crucial to say about them is that a minor alteration of the daily routine uncovers their fears and hidden desires, ironically making look them even more childish than the younger characters in the film.Wes Anderson made a great use of his well-known cast. Every actor has his or her specific role in the whole intrigue, but the greatness of those many performances can be really seen only when all of the characters come together. They're like the smaller pieces of a bigger, wholehearted and whimsical puzzle.By applying various camera techniques Wes Anderson gave some of the scenes in the picture a nifty stage play-esque touch. The atmosphere, the colors, the old-school filters, and the on- location shots, reveal the film's strange, but somehow familiar, 60's vibe.There's a lot of awkwardness in the film, but this is really what makes it so enjoyable and satisfying. Being a noteworthy addition to the comedy genre, Moonrise Kingdom aspires to be the most imaginative film of the year. Wes Anderson's stylish exploration of young love is a satisfying one, and apart from applying a lot of his typical quirk and whimsy, the director shows that he matured and put a lot of his own heart into the project.",8,2,3,5 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Truly epic conclusion
","I have been a fan of Harry Potter's adventures since the first book came out. I was 10 at that time it happened. So, It is easy to imagine a child's enormous delight when the news of a film adaptations broke out. Since that time 10 glorious years of Harry Potter's rise for the title of the biggest magic-driven phenomena in the cinema's history has passed. And my positive opinion about the books and the adaptations didn't change a bit. Even though some of the movies from the series weren't as good as others (i.e. The Order of the Phoenix), the last one didn't disappoint me at all. What is more, it was the best possible ending that I personally could have imagined. I was somehow scared that the outcome wouldn't be as astonishing as I pictured it while reading the book, but fortunately after the movie's first minutes all of my fears were gone.Great acting on the part of the three main characters just makes you wish for more. The 'Potter generation' children grew with those actors, which is why it was so hard to say goodbye. We grew accustomed to their faces and their magical adventures. We started to adore Snape. At one point in time we even wanted to be as brave as Neville Longbottom. The on-screen final battle for peace in the wizardly world is really enjoyable due to the outstanding special effects and the epic life-or-death struggle between Harry and Voldemort. Notice how young wizards and Hogwart's faculty members play a huge part, as always, in the defining moments of the movie.Sadly, after all those years it finally happened. After walking out of the cinema I simply couldn't believe that the magic is gone and there will be no more quests of Potter and his entourage. However, I was delighted of the way it was depicted, not too long and perfectly accurate with the book. Now I can only hope that the memory of such world-changing series of movies will live on in our hearts and minds and that even kids of our kids will be aware of the grand finale of finales as depicted in the Harry Potter realm.",8,0,2,26 April 2012
Rear Window," A must-see Hitchcock picture
","Rear Window, as every other classic masterpiece directed by Alfred Hitchcock, provides a gripping tale of gripping suspense and mystery that can be felt throughout the whole picture. The very gloomy and uncanny atmosphere of this picture adds up to an amazing, and unforgettable overall experience. This is definitely Hitch at his very best.It is also one of the most memorable roles of the magnificent James Stewart. If I would have to choose only one movie out of the four, on which he collaborated with Hitchcock, I would definitely pick Rear Window.Stewart plays a journalist named L. B. Jeffries, who is forced to stay at home for a few weeks after an auto race accident. With nothing better to do, he starts observing his neighbors through that eponymous rear window of his cozy apartment. At first it all seems to be just a silly way to pass the time. But as the night falls onto the city, something strange happens right across the yard and 'Jeff' is quickly drawn into a puzzling life-and-death situation. It suddenly became possible that one of his close neighbors, Lars Thorwald, is a killer on the loose and nobody seemed to have noticed it.In order for the viewer to get acquainted with the characters, the movie opens with a 30-minute easy introduction. As soon as we know the basics the action suddenly starts to take on totally different turn. The viewer gets wound up in the conundrum that leaves the protagonist sleepless.Grace Kelly is magnificent as Jeff's high-class girlfriend, Lisa Fremont. She's got so much style and glamor, and she proves to be a brave young woman too. There is one great scene, where she has to sneak into the alleged killer's place and find out if all of the murderous assumptions can actually be proved by palpable facts. I know I was cheering so mightily for her to get out, when dangerous Mr. Thorwald was getting closer and closer to his door, ready to catch Lisa right in the act.Although the whole movie takes place only on one single street, the diversity of presented characters and a deep look into their personal lives (and apartments) account for a picture, which isn't boring even for a minute. In the end we are actually able to distinguish all the people, who live nearby, as every night and day we follow them around along with Jeff's binoculars.Every true movie fanatic should watch Rear Window, as it is definitely one of the biggest achievements in cinematic craftsmanship. The thrilling script, marvelous acting, great camera shots, and the ubiquitous suspense that won't even let you blink – it's all in here, plus many more.This film actually got so many rave reviews, that it started a wave of many (better or worse) spin-offs. It influenced such films, as Blow Up, Blow Out, or more recently, Disturbia. This is the true power of a Hitchcockian movie. The themes that it presents are untimely. This is why so many directors tried to copy his style, but it's hard to point out the ones, who were actually close to the true genius of Alfred Hitchcock.",9,1,3,13 May 2012
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas set the bar far too high
","A mind-numbing, philosophically-challenging movie that wants to achieve too much with its complex, erratic plot-line. Intertwining five different stories, Cloud Atlas ponders many intriguing topics, such as reincarnation, determinism, faith, metamorphosis, and the way people's lives in different eras combine and form history as we know it. While though-provoking and engaging, the film doesn't necessarily arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory enough for the audiences.Even though - through its most Hollywood-like ending - Cloud Atlas tries to answer all the question stated in its over-complicated mash-up of interconnected tales, the manner in which it philosophizes might sound too superficial at times. It's safe to say that the movie purposefully wants to drag the viewers into its prodigious, unfathomable universe with an especially incoherent storyline (still, connecting all the dots by oneself gives great amount of pleasure). Furthermore, it's a rather weighty mixture of genres, all wrapped up in a neat package of astounding visual effects and eye-popping landscapes.Surprisingly, the same actors play unevenly in various segments, and the blame is on the directors' side (there is a distinction between the way all the parts are directed and it's significant to note that there is a visible difference in the filmmakers' styles). Cloud Atlas is an epic film, but in that case it's not a strong and authentic compliment. Its premise is undeniably enormous and smashing, but the substance calls for some sure rewrites.In defense of the whole movie it's crucial to say that the book of the same name was named one of the most 'unfilmable' of all. By trying to play subconsciously on people's imagination, the picture invites us to an unknown world filled with artificial characters with too many plastic surgeries, and to a place where some stories seem too redundant and insignificant in the final evaluation. While ambitious, Cloud Atlas evaluates its themes briefly and arrives at a conclusion that's not to be grasped wholeheartedly.",7,0,4,9 November 2012
Donnie Darko," Disturbingly fantastic
","Donnie Darko, a movie by Richard Kelly, tells a story about the title boy, who is accredited as mentally unstable. One night, he meets a big, scary rabbit named Frank. His new friend knowingly saves Donnie's life. From now on, he needs to recompense this favor and be obedient. What is more, with this eerie encounter Donnie falls into a labyrinth of mysterious events, incidentally seeking for the truth behind life and death. This movie is a specific blend of horror, science fiction and psychological thriller. It is nothing like all teen movies, such as American Pie, which gives the viewer a miserable bunch of jokes. This is really a very intelligent movie and, at the same time, unpredictable. Nothing is certain, until the ultimate ending. It is one of those movies that have so many to offer: great acting (brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal and Jean Malone), sensational turns in action, suspense and overwhelming mystery. Also, songs used in the movie give a great impression and fantastically collide with the picture.The only negative point may be the confusing script. It is hard to understand the remittance and some viewers can reject this picture, because of lack of patience. It takes a few times to finally make any sense. However, that is what makes this movie so magical and unforgettable. There are many apt interpretations and, still, people try to grasp it from another point of view. Personally, I think it is one of the best movies ever made, and it is only sad that it was not ever promoted, as it should have been. It is really well worth seeing, as it may be one of the most spectacular and, at the same time, murky movies of all times.",9,0,1,31 March 2011
The Social Network," The infamous story behind Facebook
","I have to admit - When I first heard of this movie, I basically could not believe that a flick based on a story of a computer nerd, who invented the biggest social website, can be really interesting. After seeing the trailer it came to me - the Facebook, in fact, is just a device that generates the old-as-our-world motifs of friendship, betrayal, greed and need to belong. Just then, I wanted to see it so badly to be reassured that my vision is correct. And I was not disappointed. This two-hour movie takes the viewer on a ride, which can surely be attached to a thriller or action genre. It certainly is unconventional for a classic biopic. The rapid dialogues written by Aaron Sorkin are the daisies of this picture. They make you feel like you are in a room with the Harvard geniuses themselves. What is more, we finally see Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and the wit behind Facebook) arise from the shadow of Michael Cera, giving us one of the best acts in his career. Right after Jesse, we get brilliant performances made by Andrew Garfield (Eduardo Saverin, CFO, the deserted one) and Rooney Mara (the girl who dumps Mark and is a direct cause of Mark's creation). Moreover, listen carefully to the original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross - back pins and needles delivered. I will not reveal the plot, but I can assure that most of the audience will be delighted. Now, just to reaffirm my point - I gave The Social Network 10/10, because honestly, I have to say that this is so far the best movie of the year 2010 and it will for sure fight for an Oscar or two, and will be remembered as one of the best flicks about networking in history.",10,0,0,21 October 2010
Beetlejuice," Essential Tim Burton with a nice bunch of laughs
","Every Tim Burton picture is capable of inducing many uncontrollable laughs from the audience. On the other hand, it's also able to hypnotize through this specific Burton-y tone and visual style that characterizes all of his productions.And Beetlejuice is definitely that one picture, which actually started a sudden Burton-mania and put him on the spot as one of the most eccentric and original directors of the 20th century. When a light-hearted couple, Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam (Alec Baldwin) Maitland, unexpectedly die one day, they realize that they will be trapped in their own house for another 'couple' of years without any chances of getting out. And this wouldn't be a bad thing, if it weren't for one irritating family, which bought the home, moved in, and wants to make a few changes inside. Being two regular ghosts, the prime residents understand that the only way to get rid of the annoying new homeowners is to scare them away. Unfortunately, all this doesn't seem to be too easy, as they quickly become a sort of attraction for the Deetz clan. The only person that is able to actually see and bond with the unhappy couple is the overly weird and gloomy Lydia (Winona Ryder). She wants to help her new and lifeless friends. Yet, as things still don't go as planned, it appears that the only creature that may be of any guidance is the aberrant, obnoxious, and very impetuous Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton)Calling himself a 'bio-exorcist', he promises to scare away the Deetzes with a couple of his frightening tricks. However, there is something else on his wild mind – he wants to force Lydia into becoming his lovely bride. And this doesn't seem to suit anyone in particular.The movie has plenty of fantastically humorous gags, applied in a rather macabre and dark manner, so typical of a film created by Tim Burton. What's more, all of the creatures that appear in the otherworld scenery are hilarious and look like they were taken straight out of a cartoon (also, look for the group of dead football players - a reference to a tragic plane crash that really happened).Michael Keaton gives an incredible performance as the preposterous, ludicrous, and totally ridiculous deceased exterminator, who happens to look for some love in the human world. From the moment when we see him for the first time the movie gets on a totally different, much faster pace. He soon becomes the brightest star of the movie, with all that he says and does, and in a most amusing way.It's funny to watch Alec Baldwin in such an untypical role. I must say that even though we are accustomed to seeing him in more of action-hero-type movies, he still gives a decent performance. His character seems fairly likable, and combined with Geena Davis as his wife, the two create a couple that everyone can adore.All in all, if you are looking for some fun time with a movie that won't bore you for a second, give Beetlejuice a try. It's a Burton creation that is as heart-warming, as it is crazy and bizarre.",7,0,0,10 June 2012
