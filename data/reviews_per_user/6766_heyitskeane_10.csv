Ford v Ferrari," Fantastic from start to finish
","Ford v Ferrari is one hell of a ride and a fantastic movie from start to finish.It's directed by James Mangold, he did Logan (2017) and Walk the Line (2005), and stars Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Jon Bernthal to name a few. When I first heard about it, all I knew was Mangold was in charge, and Damon and Bale were in it and I was already interested. And now that I've seen it...it's amazing.Probably the best aspect of this movie is the directing. Mangold does a terrific job here and the movie looks and feels superb. There are sequences that'll just move you to the edge of your seat.The performances are great as well, especially by Damon and Bale. Both their characters are an absolute joy to watch and the chemistry between them both is excellent. Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is probably my favourite part of the movie. The character is just terrific and hilarious on the screen.The start and first act of the movie may be a bit slow for some people (I understood why but still thought it was fine). Other than that, I don't really see a flaw or issue.Ford v Ferrari is definitely one of the best movies in 2019. It's a whole lot of fun, excitement and joy packed into 152 minutes that feels a lot quicker than it is.",9,1,2,30 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Sensational
","Its a thrilling, stunning masterpiece; equalling (over) its powerful predecessor.Blade Runner 2049 is just amazing. It's everything I wanted in a Blade Runner sequel and so much more.The film is visually stunning. The visual effects in this movie is just one-of-a-kind and beautiful. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is just a joy to witness on the big screen.The plot of 2049 expands on the Blade Runner lore, widening the dystopian world first created by Ridley Scott in 1982. Denis Villenueve brings his best film yet, with excellent writing and directing.The characters in this film are great overall, with well-rounded performances. In the film, Ryan Gosling's Officer K really stands out. His character, although mostly stoic (for SPOILER reason), is just terrific and moving. Gosling brings a dark, emotional, gritty performance which is just perfect for his character and setting. Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard from the original and brings along an amazing performance to his character. Deckard is visibly and mentally shaken and skeptical in his time, continuing his character of Deckard.The film is in itself a stand-alone movie. In my opinion, I wouldn't call it a sequel. Yes, it is continuing and expanding from the original and yes it is in the same universe. But it does not rely on it. At all. There are no flashbacks to inform the general audience who have not seen the original, there is no convenient re-telling of the original, there is none of that. This is an independent film, conveying its own tale in its own way.For me, there were no major flaws with the film. Although after my second viewing, the pace of the movie begins to form a flaw in the film. The film is slow paced, with unusually long shots and pans. With my intial viewing, the pace did not strike me as much of a flaw, but on the second viewing, it did begin to bother me. For fans of Blade Runner (like me), the slow pace might be a signature characteristic in the film, highlighting it from other sci-fi films. However for the general audience, it might not be as well appreaciated.Overall, the movie is amazing and is one of the best films I've seen. Best film of 2017 for me. For fans, this will be a delight and it is highly recommended. For the general audience, if you want to experience something different in science fiction, in neo-noir dystopic films, then I would recommend 2049. If you just watch movies to switch your brains off for a couple of hours and watch some action and explosions, this movie is NOT for you.Tip: If you are interested in 2049 and have not seen the original Blade Runner, do it.",10,3,17,2 August 2018
Knives Out," Pretty damn good.
","This movie is pretty good. A solid 8/10 and probably one of the best in 2019.Knives Out (as minimal as possible) is about the death of a family patriarch and the investigation of his death. It's written and directed by Rian Johnson; he did Looper which was great and The Last Jedi which was not so great but anyways..This movie is pretty damn good. It's a classic who-done-it crime/detective story set in modern day 2019. It's directed beautifully and the cinematography is on point. And it's actually very funny, which I don't think the marketing really shows.The performances in this movie are fantastic, especially by Bond himself, Daniel Craig. He carries this movie and honestly his character is an absolute joy to watch. The rest of the cast is great as well, notable performances from Ana De Armas and Chris Evans.The narrative and writing is also very well done by Rian Johnson. It's nice to see him doing films of his own instead of big franchise movies.Some of the characters are kinda there just for comedic effect, but
I didn't mind it. It wasn't really a bad thing, didn't bother the narrative. My main 'issue' with the movie was that I was hoping the actual plot itself involved more of the characters directly, if you watch the movie you'll probably notice that. It's not really an issue just something I thought would've made the movie better.Other than that I don't really see an actual flaw in the movie. The opening sequence is just perfect, the sound design fits perfectly. It's funny when it needs to be and suspenseful when it neds to be. Knives Out hits all the checkpoints of a good solid movie.Definitely check this one out it's really good, really enjoyable and an absolute killer (no pun intended).",8,2,13,25 November 2019
The Irishman," It'll paint your house, in a very good way.
","The Irishman is just wow I haven't seen a movie like this in a while.It's directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese, no need to say too much about his achievements, and it stars quite the cast: Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Anna Paquin, Harvey Keitel and Ray Romano to name a few.This movie was quite the watch. I couldn't get to see it on the big screen so I had to wait for the Netflix release but safe to say that wait was worth it. The Irishman is one of the best films of 2019. The writing and narrative is spectacular and the performances are amazing (obviously). I have to say, De Niro was the heart and soul of this film. Scorsese (yet again) nails the directing. There were sequences which were just perfectly shot and just a beauty to watch it unfold and play out. Also I don't think many people mentioned the score but that was very well done.Now the main discussion point: that runtime. This movie is 3 hours and 29 minutes long. And for a movie like this with a lot of talking that clocks in at 209 minutes, I was never actually bored throughout the movie. The writing and narrative was just so well done and I was just so interested throughout the entire movie.Could it have been shorter? Yes, of course.Does it have to be shorter? No, definitely not.Anyways runtime aside, I don't see an actual flaw I have with this movie. It's that good and film lovers should definitely check it out. Take your time with this one, it's worth it.",8,2,6,28 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fan service isn't enough to rise over familiarity and laziness.
","Star Wars. Episode IX. The Rise of Skywalker. J.J. Abrams. The dead speak! ... sighThe Rise of Skywalker is directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Richard E. Grant, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver ... yeah you know the rest of the Star Wars cast.First off, this movie is more disappointing than enjoyable. As a 'conclusion' to the Skywalker Saga, I must say from both fan and film standpoint, this is disappointing and underwhelming.The good parts: the movie looks great. J.J. Abrams and his crew nailed it once again as they did with The Force Awakens. The visuals are stunning, definitely worth watching on the big screen. I mean, if a Star Wars movie can't get their visuals right then, is it even a Star Wars movie?Some of the performances were also great, especially by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver (once again). The rest of the cast did what they could with what they were given. I have to say, they did a pretty good job with Carrie Fisher's (RIP) performance and how they stiched it together with unused footage and deleted scenes. It went right by me and I thought they did an amazing job.There's also plenty of fan-service throughout the whole movie, so fans calm down you'll all be pretty satisfied. The score by John Williams is (once again) nice, nostalgic and perfect for the movie.Now, onto the not-so-good parts. My main flaw/disappointment with The Rise of Skywalker is how familiar it is. I suppose they were afraid of the criticism from The Last Jedi that they decided to play everything safe and satisfy as many fans as possible. The thing is, they played it too safe and it gets to the point where the plot becomes predictable and unsurprising. There's nothing new or original to be excited about. And that just lost majority of my interest in the movie because you can guess what's about to happen next and you're going to guess right (unfortunately). It's almost like the movie's just spoiling itself.That also leads to a lack of emotional weight throughout the movie. You just stop caring about the characters because you pretty much know how the movie's going to end. There's all this action and spectacle going on but you just don't care about who it involves.The plot and narrative is also (apart from being unimaginative) very messy. The entire first act feels extremely rushed. From the very first line of the opening crawl, it almost feels like they're trying to jump right into the second act. Scenes are just so short and rushed that you end up just forgetting the point of it.I also found the writing to be quite...lazy. There were just so many plot holes and conveniences that it's hard to look over. Yes, every movie has plot holes and sometimes it's fine to look over them. But this movie has just hole after hole that it just starts annoying you. There were also scenes and characters which were safe to say, pointless. Some of the dialogue, especially by Finn and Poe, were disappointingly poor and cringy. There were just weird lines and one-liners that did not feel natural or normal at all. It almost felt like a 6-year old wrote it on a fan-fiction.I think the lesson from The Rise of Skywalker is that fan-service doesn't always cut it. Yes, as a fan I was hoping that this movie would satisfy, but I was also looking for a bit of change and fresh air with the saga. The Force Awakens was nice but familiar. The Last Jedi was not-so-nice but it was something different. So, I was hoping they'd maybe find some middle ground between the two. But alas, I was mistaken.",5,10,18,19 December 2019
1917," Once it starts, it doesn't stop.
","Nineteen seventeen. Sam Mendes. Just superb.This movie is downright amazing. Definitely one of the best movies of 2019 and one of the best war films I've seen. It's thrilling, exciting, scary, shocking and heartfelt, all jam-packed into one beautiful film.The biggest topic of this film is probably how it looked as if it was shot in one single, continuous take. And there's good reason for it. The one-take format just elevated this whole movie with so much more tension and immersiveness. It's very well done from Sam Mendes. There are some scenes where it's easy to spot when they decided to stop the shot and transition into another, but over time it just became seamless.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is also very on-point (as usual). As well as Thomas Newman's score. That was 1917's secret weapon. The score brings the movie from 100 to 1000. Everything is just elevated the moment Newman's score hits and it is beautiful.Performance wise, the entire cast is superb. Especially George MacKay. His performance was just fantastic. I did appreciate that the film didn't focus on the characters with the big stars (Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden) playing them.1917 is an epic, visceral, stunning depiction of WWI. Buckle up cause once it starts, it doesn't stop.",9,8,12,9 January 2020
The Dark Knight," A masterpiece.
","Truly one of the best (if not the best film) I've ever watched in my life. Its thrilling, engaging and suspenseful; with excellent directing and terrific performances.In my opinion, this is Christopher Nolan's best film. It is simply amazing. The characters are all well performed and driven, with clear and understandable motives, especially Heath Ledger's Joker. Truly one of a kind with his groundbreaking performance, stealing the entire show whenever he's behind the camera. Christian Bale does a great job as The Caped Crusader once again, bringing his character to newer, elevated levels from its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is powerful, bringing the really threatening aspect of the character on screen. Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon delivers as the gritty, hard-boiled detective once again. However in the end, its the Joker that really takes home the win for this film. His character is just mesmerising. His actions, performance, motives and purpose are all simply unique and astonishing.Christopher Nolan once again delivers (as usual, this man is simply too good) with a film excellently written and directed. Hanz Zimmer's score is terrific, striking out when its supposed to and setting the tone for each scene.Although this movie is a 'superhero' film (because yes there's Batman), its really not. Its a crime film. Its grounded, tenacious and mature. It handles themes beyond the superhero genre. In this movie, if Batman is replaced with a character with some fancy technology, martial arts and Batman's values, the film would be exactly the same. There is no happy ending where the hero saves the day and gets the girl. Nolan brings Batman to real life in this film as it is so well fleshed out and realised.Overall, The Dark Knight is just spectacular. I've never seen a film so well performed and directed. Its realistic, iconic and truly masterful.",10,1,2,2 August 2018
It Chapter Two," A bit underwhelming
","Finally got around to watch It: Chapter Two and...it's okay. Alright.It 2 is the sequel to It (2017) also directed by Andy Muschietti, and follows The Losers Club after 27 years of the events of It. This movie is alright, it could've been a lot better, or a lot worse, but it's okay.Possibly the best aspect of the movie are the performances, especially by Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain. Honestly, the whole cast is amazing. The chemistry between them is just flawless that you really believe they were in the previous movie and now all grown up and back together. If that isn't good acting then I don't know what is. The directing by Andy Muschietti is also terrific, some shots were just like falling right into the novel (which I loved).The narrative however, not so great. It felt like the movie was basically doing the exact same thing from the first except now the characters are adults. Which also means the movie is just not as scary as the first one. And that kinda sucks.Another point is the runtime, which has been heavily discussed. Honestly, this movie is a bit too long. I get it they're trying to include as much as possible from the novel, which is great but when its almost 3 hours long and the narrative isn't that good, things start to get boring and dull. If they wanted to include as much from the novel as possible, they should've just made it a series, which could've been a lot better.However, there is one part that I really enjoyed from the movie. That was the characters themselves. Watching them reunite as friends (after most of them left Derry) was honestly quite heartwarming. So, it's a movie about a scary children-eating clown and that's my favourite part.Overall, It: Chapter Two was alright. It's not bad, but it's not great either. A shorter runtime and a more engaging narrative would made it much better.",6,0,1,26 November 2019
Parasite," It'll make you laugh, cry and probably check your basement
","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core.",9,1,5,7 December 2019
Marriage Story," Beauty and sadness neatly packed into a stunning film.
","First of all I have to say, I'm not a massive fan of the romance genre, but I have to say, I love this movie.Marriage Story is written and directed by Noah Baumbach and stars Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and Laura Dern to name a few.This movie is beautiful. Every single aspect of this movie is just very well done. The performances by the entire cast, especially by Driver and Johansson, are one of top class and one of the best this year. Both Driver and Johansson deliver their career-best performance in this movie. The emotions are just so raw and pure it's mesmerising. Both deserve to achieve some recognition from the Academy.Next, the writing. Goddamn it's on-point. The story and narrative is just beautiful yet heartbreaking. The dialogue written by Baumbach is just exceptional. Possibly the best aspect (next to the performances) is the directing. There are shots and sequences in this movie that were just perfect. The cinematography is of the highest level. There were several long takes in this movie and the characters had monologues and I was completely blown away.I don't see a flaw in this movie. It's basically perfect. The runtime is not too short or too long. The characters are great. The narrative is amazing. The writing is well-done. I mean, what more do you want?",8,4,12,2 December 2019
