Changeling," A very impressive movie, which makes you thinking
","Before I saw this movie,I thought it might would be boring but then I watched it and now I think this film isn't boring at all. The film is made without special effects, this makes the story and the acting more important, and both of this are great, the story is gripping and even if you know it is a true story it is unbelievable. The most important role is the one of Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins, and with Angelina Jolie Clint Eastwood made the best choice he could. She acts fantastic and her acting makes this movie such impressing and because of her it is so memorable to.I would recommend this movie to people who like gripping and impressive films, it is nothing for people who just go to cinema to laugh.",9,1,4,28 February 2010
The Hangover," a very funny comedy
","Without any doubt this was definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece but if you're looking forward to an entertaining movie full of unpredictable jokes and situations this could be it.The Hangover tells the story of four guys who take off to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. After a tough night they don't remember anything and above all is the groom-to-be missing. The other three men start reconstructing their passed night, trying to find their lost friend.The extremely funny story is supported by well-known and very entertaining music as well as by the impressive and beautiful scenery of Nevada and the famous city of Las Vegas. All of the mainly male characters play a superb and distinctive role.I recommend this comedy to everyone who hasn't laughed in a while, enjoys American movies full of jokes and doesn't get offended by harsh language. Enjoy yourself!",8,1,2,23 February 2010
Inglourious Basterds," A mind-blowing bloodbath!
","Inglourious Basterds is an absolutely outstanding new masterpiece of Quentin Tarantino. Although WW2 is a complete new direction for him, Tarantino manages to keep his unique style. Once again you have to laugh about things which are anything but funny, especially about the way Landa verbally tortures people such as Shoshanna or the Farmer at the beginning. The mostly very long dialogs are truly fantastic and because Christopher Waltz plays so well, you will admire the whole movie and discover an absolutely new kind of humor (especially if this is your first Tarantino Movie).Due to its brutality (Hitler getting shot dozens of times i.e.) it's not made for everyone, but if you can somehow fight yourself to watch it, you will hopefully see and respect this valuable contribution to global culture!",10,0,6,1 March 2010
Troy," Wonderful historic film
","Troy- a city that isn't existing anymore and it's also blurry if it ever existed. The story behind this city was written by Homer in the 'Ilias'. Those who bothered to read this enormous book, recognized that it's almost impossible to create a film out of it. However, the director Wolfgang Petersen resolved the problem and brought in the most important part of the 'Ilias' in the film. Hats off! For me the film is a piece of art and can be compared with other historic films like 'Gladiator', 'Kingdom of Heaven' or 'Alexander'. But why is that film so brilliant? First of all the plot beautiful especially the beach and the city with its high wall and the palace. As I know it took the film-crew months to build up this background scenery. Secondly, the actors did an amazing job, especially Eric Bana as Hector. I've never heard about him until I've seen the film. For once also Brad Pitt was doing well as a thoughtful Achilles. A very emotional music is going along with the whole film and it fortifies the alliance between viewer and the characters. Because it's also played during fitting scenes it gives the film a certain credibility.To sum up, 'Troy' is a wonderful film for history-interested people and is casted with fantastic actors. The music is also doing its part by influencing the viewer even stronger. 'Troy' is definitely a 'Must-see', otherwise there would be a gap of ancient Greek culture and history.",9,2,6,3 March 2010
Forrest Gump," Hello Forrest =)
","He made a great step forward literally.. First he had his legs wrapped in iron and later he ran through the hole United States, just because he wanted to run, just carefree. This person has to be kind of naive or not? From the little kid that got mobbed to a national personality- that's the story of Forrest, Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump was actually the first movie that made me cry at the end. One now might think that it is a really sad story but there's also a lot of happiness in there. All that great things that naive Forrest experiences made me laugh.Although it is a quite long movie I could watch it again and again just because it's also very funny sometimes, it's the mix, I think between sadness and happiness that makes this movie one of the greatest ever.",Null,2,3,3 March 2010
Spirited Away," Masterpiece
","Hayao Miyazaki made with 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' another remarkable and beautiful anime film. I really enjoyed watching it and I can fully understand why this movie is one of the most successful in Japanese history.You can watch this film over and over again and you still find new details that you haven't discovered yet. But 'Spirited Away' isn't just a feel-good movie, it is also criticizes certain things like, e.g. how modern society is treating the environment.I can recommend this fantastic movie not only to children, certainly not!! Hayao Miyazaki just knows how to make films that you won't forget. 'Mononoke Hime' and 'Tonari no Totoro' are two other candidates...Simply beautiful. A must-see movie.",Null,0,0,28 February 2010
Twilight," an impressive film with a romantic story
","If you are watching this impressive film, you will be involved immediately in its story. The catchy tale of Bella and Edward brought a huge smile to my face and I started dreaming. I love the film, even if it is not that extraordinary as the book on which it is based. Everybody should watch the film, because the story is awesome not only to read but also look at.The young Bella Swan falls in love with the vampire Edward Cullen, so she starts to get in trouble The actors are well chosen and every character fits perfectly to its role. There are mainly young actors to make it especially attractive for a youthful audience. The acting is moving and the music suits the film. The camera work is really understated.This gripping and enjoyable film is for all those who like romantic stories with a whiff of mythology. It's a must-seen movie for every fan, but also for people who like fairy tales and supernatural love stories.",8,1,5,27 February 2010
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan is really one of the most realistic and moving war movies that I've ever seen!
",I've seen this film 2 weeks ago and I've never forgotten this dramatic film. It's not only a normal World War II film movie but a movie with a very moving story and many impressive scenes. It's a mus seen film because you really can imagine that you were accompanying the search troop which was looking for James Ryan. Some parts are filmed with hand cameras which have the effect that you're much more on the edge of your seat and thus it takes the character of a realistic documentary film. But also the typical war music makes you feel some shivers. With the actor Tom Hanks as captain John Miller you see a convincing major who plays his role as if he had never been doing something else. Personally I think that this is the best and most dramatic war movie I've ever seen. It really pushes you to think about the situations in war and about the army and all this stuff. I recommend Saving private Ryan' to everyone who likes war movies with partly true and impressive stories and who isn't scared if he sees sometimes some blood.,9,2,3,28 February 2010
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting
","Good Will Hunting is a moving drama which talks about what makes life livable. Although Will grew up in humble circumstances and with no parents he's a very talented young man with a great memory and an enormous ability to solve complex mathematics problem. Because Will's such a genius and had read that many books he thinks to know everything about life. It's Sean – a psychiatrist – who shows him that he doesn't. Will starts to understand that there are things in life you can't read or learn but you have to experience. So as love. The movie shows in a great way that there are things we can't explain logically. And that it's worth to fight for the one you love. Even if it means that you have to change your life or give something else up. Especially the end, where Will gives up his old life for a girl is very memorable and moving.",Null,0,1,4 March 2010
The Game," Great film!
","In my opinion, 'The Game' is an absolutely breathtaking film and a great mix between an innovative concept and huge acting. It mixes the gripping ideas of producer David Fincher with the representation of a great main character by Michael Douglas.The plot is based on a memorable mix between realistic and unrealistic features. The most exciting part of the story is probably the ending, when Nicholas realizes that the whole story was just a try from his brother to make him more natural and change his type of a greedy businessman. The superb acting strengthen this effect. The perspectives of the cameras are well-chosen, too.So if you want to see a film with an extraordinary story about an egocentric businessman receiving a special birthday present from his brother, you should definitely watch this film",9,1,1,28 February 2010
Avatar," Masterpiece! Must see!
","I saw the masterpiece 'Avatar', an epic movie from James Cameron, some time ago over an internet site and some days later also a second time in cinema. It was seriously the best film I've ever seen.The plot is rather simple for a film which is almost three hours long, but you really can feel whats going on in the inside of the characters. Acting isn't really important in this film because most of the film is made by technology, but the acting which is done is really nice. The music always fits perfectly to the mood of the film. The best part next to the plot is of course the mind blowing use of technology. They used the relatively new 3-D technology like they've been working with it for ages.As we know today, 'Avatar' broke a lot of records in film history, 14 nominees for Oscars, 33 other winnings, which show that this film is definitely a masterpiece in the history of cinema and shows whats possible these days with our technology.",10,3,7,4 March 2010
Titanic," Titanic
","How long does it take until a passenger liner is gone under? Ten minutes? Half an hour? No; it's almost incredible but it can take more then three hours. Titanic, a big passenger liner is on his way from England to the USA. During the journey a rich, young women called Rose meets the young, poor Jack Dowson. After seeing the trailer you know everything what will happen. It's a love story with tragic end like you have seen in a lot of movies. The plot is absolutely hackneyed. The first two hours are terribly boring and kitschy. A man meets a woman. They fall in love. That's all. Furthermore, the move is accompanied by the ugly voice of Celin Dion with her overrated song, my heart will go on, which consists only few chords. In short, the movie is no worth seeing.",Null,1,2,4 March 2010
The Departed," Confusing yet thrilling plot
","This is one of the best gangster movies, I've ever seen. The story is quiet confusing but at the same time really conclusive.In the beginning there's nothing really special, you see a young guy (Matt Damon) infiltrating the Massachusets States Police and delivering information to his friend and boss of the Irish Mafia Costello (Jack Nicholson). But not long after he is grouped into a new unit, an other young guy (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins to work for the Police and in turn infiltrates Costello's gang. That's when the story becomes exciting. As the two characters get used to their new environments, the viewer often doesn't really know anymore who is the good guy and who the bad guy. You might not know who is more sympathetic to you until the end which is very abrupt and, in my opinion, a little bit special.Although the plot sounds really nice (and it is of course!), also this movie has its faults. The two main characters advance in their ranks really fast, which is not really realistic. Also both of them work straight for their side. I think good and bad can't be defined like black and white, but like tones of gray, and so the characters should act too.There are negative points in this movie, nobody can deny it. But the positive side of the movie is clearly dominant. It's a must for fans of gangster movies and I totally recommend it to everyone who likes a thrilling plot and lots of action.",9,1,6,4 March 2010
Step Up," Step Up - funny, emotional, exciting!
","I think the movie Step Up is a great film, the story is funny but it has its moving parts as well and the balance between them is very good. The whole story is entertaining and sometimes it is also quite exciting.I think the actors are both extraordinarily good dancers and they act really good as well. The story isn't that new, but it's a good, interesting story. Anyway, in this film the dancing is more important than the story and the dancing is very beautiful and really impressive.I think we can make the best comparison with the sequel of Step Up, Step Up to the Streets. I like the second one too, but I prefer the first one. In Step Up to the Streets the story is a bit more interesting and more inventive, but the dancing isn't as good as in Step Up.In conclusion I would say if you are a fan of dancing, then it is really worth seeing Step Up.",10,2,3,3 March 2010
The Truman Show," The Truman Show - an original and innovative movie!
","The movie starts exactly at the point, when Truman begins to realize, that he's living in a constructed reality soap opera: A light of the artificial night sky falls down and nearly hits him. But also the spectator of the movie begins to wonder about the strange things that happen to Truman. By and by, the spectator gets aware of the fact, that Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras and broadcasted live around the world, what makes the story so extraordinary. So the movie is definitely not just about an all-day story, therefore I think that the plot is quite original and innovative. The fact that the spectator of the film gets inducted into Truman's secret even earlier than Truman himself makes his actions really funny and gripping.However, the story of Truman isn't funny at all, it's rather tragic. The plot and the well- fitting music keep the film quite moving and the spectator begins to feel sympathy for Truman.Finally, the movie turns out well, but the story keeps you thinking about today's TV and its influence on people.All in all, the Truman Show is a beautiful movie with a fascinating story and moving background music, and though it's already more than 10 years old, I can thoroughly recommend you to watch it!",9,0,1,26 February 2010
