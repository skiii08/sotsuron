The Monuments Men," Bring EVERYTHING to America now!
","This is the main lesson taught by THE MONUMENTS MEN. The best WWII flick of 2014 (so far), MONUMENTS MEN explains how Hitler almost destroyed most of the world's art heritage (that is, Western Civilization). In my lifetime, the giant Buddhas in Afghanistan--their Twin Towers--have been lost forever. There were the world's largest statues--standing for umpteen centuries--and they were used for Taliban artillery target practice. America twiddled its thumbs when this happened. Therefore, the Taliban were emboldened to have their Al Qaida henchmen destroy OUR Twin Towers (which were the world's tallest buildings when they were built). See a pattern here? The Great Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Kremlin's St. Basil church are among the world's most endangered cultural treasures we still have left. We moved London Bridge to Arizona already; it's high time we bring the Pyramids and the rest of it over here for safe keeping, as well. American billionaires will chip in for transportation costs (and may be willing to throw in the cost of placing full-scale replicas at original sites, if the host governments prefer to have something for their angry mobs to vandalize and destroy). After you see how America saved the world once already in THE MONUMENTS MEN, you'll join me in demanding that we establish a World Monument Valley at a suitably warm site, with the same amenities as (preferably adjacent) LegoLands, Sea Worlds, and Six Flags.",Null,0,0,27 February 2014
John Wick," No time for Snoopy . . .
",". . . as the cold-blooded murder of JOHN WICK's pet beagle results in the violent killings of 81 men and one woman. To add insult to injury, 'Daisy' the late beagle is replaced by a pit bull! All the trouble can be traced to the White Russian mobsters who control the New York City and other U.S. metro areas in Real Life. (We just saw the exact same thing in THE DROP and THE EQUILIZER; seeing it twice on the Big Screen might be a coincidence, but having it shown THREE TIMES in a month proves it's true!) These foreign-born ruffians have no respect for American Values such as beagles, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They spend most of their time Jibber-Jabbering away in Foreign--which no one else can understand--plotting against our welfare and beagles. (Incomprehensibly, millions of taxpayer dollars subsidize countless school and college students in their scheme to learn these plotter 'language' codes, with no background checks whatsoever!) JOHN WICK's neighborhood cop, 'Jimmy,' has encased all of John's guns in concrete due to noise complaints, and John can barely retrieve them in time to avenge 'Daisy.' With more and more of America's dogs in the news for learning now to shoot the bad guys themselves, it's heart-warming to learn that the BANGS organization (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps) has awarded the Real Life animal actor who portrayed 'Daisy' an honorary 'Beagle Americans Need Gun Shells' tag.",6,2,18,27 October 2014
Lone Survivor," Nowadays Gamegirl lounging in her pink bunny P.J.'s . . .
",". . . at a drone control station around the corner from a San Antonio-area McDonald's can accomplish the failed mission depicted in LONE SURVIVOR and 'live to tell the story' over her Egg McMuffin. The grueling Navy S.E.A.L. training of LONE SURVIVOR's opening credits is OBSOLETE today. Gamegirl's drone can pick out the Taliban leader 'with no earlobes' and liquidate him with a Hellfire Missile without her P.J.'s needing to soak up any sweat. When you balance the cost of Gamegirl's training and salary against the drilling, equipment, transportation, health care, and survivor benefits of Marky Mark's S.E.A.L. squad (one of whom whines 'HOW can the Taliban move faster than us?!' just before he expires), Gamegirl costs we taxpayers LESS THAN 10% as much as one of those self-styled Supermen. S.E.A.L.s are great for propaganda movies, but even LONE SURVIVOR shows them moving like 90-year-old grannies with walkers (weighed down by tons of excess equipment) compared to the locals, who pick them off one by one while moving with the nimbleness of the goats they herd (though these Taliban can't shoot well enough to hit the broad side of a barn). Gamegirl doesn't know one word of the local language halfway around the world, but neither does Marky Mark's S.E.A.L. character in LONE SURVIVOR. I don't mind paying to watch movie S.E.A.L.s, but subsidizing real-life ones is another story.",8,4,11,14 January 2014
Captain Marvel," This flick is the story of a bunch of guys cruelly messing around . . .
",". . . with a young lady's mind. These malicious miscreants even create a misleading, counterfeit, false hologram of title character 'Carol's' courageous female mentor to make it seem as if there are women involved along with the men in their sordid masculine perfidy. CAPTAIN MARVEL goes a long way toward baring out the famous adage, 'The only good man is a DEAD man.' When you finally get down to tin tacks, who can Carol REALLY trust when she morphs into CAPTAIN MARVEL, other than her spiritual guide 'Wendy,' her best friend 'Maria,' and Maria's young sprout, 'Monica'? DIE HARD recently learned NOT to put his trust in some wild, one-eyed 'Glass' jack; why should Carol? (She probably does NOT hanker to get drowned in a mud puddle!) Besides her women friends, the other main thing Carol has going for her are her trigger fingers. CAPTAIN MARVEL proves herself to be an ambidextrous shooter, exercising her Second Amendment rights with two-fisted Equal Opportunity. Unfortunately, not all of us will enjoy the Good Fortune to have Carol's firepower magically appear at our fingertips. Many of us cannot afford even measly military assault-style rifles, let alone such vital accessories as extended magazines, laser sights, and ample ammo. That's why YOU need to Join the Movement TODAY by supporting your local chapter of BANGS (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps)!",10,5,24,13 March 2019
About Time," An intriguing set of new rules for time travel . . .
",". . . graces this import from Britain, the best movie about flipping one's chronology since last year's SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED. Both of these films put thoughtful and creative new spins on time travel, which is necessary when the majority of the films made in this genre lack coherence and internal consistency. While there may be a point or two to quibble over regarding ABOUT TIME (my main sticking point being the mid-movie appearance of 'Boy Posy'--undoing that snafu seems like closing the barn door after the livestock has escaped; it's generally tougher to push toothpaste back into the tube), the excellence of the acting performances tends to smooth over any such rough patches. Long-time British A-lister Brendan Gleeson's son Domhnall is a revelation in the lead role of Tim, and Bill Nighy (he of the octopus beard in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchise) looks more like a screen-match dad for Tim than Brendan would have been, plus he pulls his role off with a level of tenderness not seen in most of the screen parts played by Domhnall's real-life father (frequently cast as a 'heavy'). ABOUT TIME is NOT for those who forget their hankies, but it IS a great date flick!",10,3,6,26 October 2013
American Sniper," Clint Eastwood's courageous film, AMER!CAN SNIPER . . .
",". . . clearly is the best English language movie of 2014, as well as topping JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN as the most moving anti-war flick of all time. One of the first things title character Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) points out to his eventual wife, Taya (Sienna Miller), is that he's a proud Texan, NOT a Redneck. 'We ride horses, they ride cousins,' is how he puts it. Before notching a record 160-plus one-by-one death shots in Iraq, Eastwood is careful to show that Chief Kyle follows in the steps of such famous American serial killers as Alvin York (initiated on turkeys) and Jeffrey Dahmer (who began with dogs) when young lad Chris guns down an unarmed deer under the supervision of his dad. Nicknamed 'Legend' (apparently his fellow S.E.A.L.s were big Will Smith fans), Chris feels doomed by this phrase--'When does glory fade away, and become a losing Crusade?'--written in a letter home by one of the many 'spotters' he loses to an enemy sniper (as this is another true-life sniper vs. sniper tale, similar to the WWII story, ENEMY AT THE GATES). That serves as Chris' comrade's own eulogy a couple weeks later. Director Eastwood bravely exposes the Olympic movement as a terrorist training ground with a Syrian gold medalist in sharp-shooting gunning down hundreds of America's finest every time Chris is on the satellite phone with his spouse, or having a conjugal visit with Taya back in Texas. Eastwood's tacit conclusion is that America has to avoid having traitors such as W. and his cronies corrupting our Youth with phony baloney military excursions. Unlike a 90% 'good war' such as WWII, the fallout from a 99% 'bad war' like Iraq curses everything it touches, as Chris Kyle and his family learn in AMER1CAN SNIPER.",10,12,35,20 January 2015
We're the Millers," Enjoyable fare for the whole family . . .
",". . . as WE'RE THE MILLERS is a movie with its heart in the right place. MILLERS teaches many valuable lessons. One is not to get tattoos on a whim in your youth. It might be fine for a stripper to have the words 'Boner Garage' tatted on her belly above a big arrow pointing 'down there,' but how will it look when she's 93 and is being prepped for an incontinence procedure? Second, MILLERS shows that as long as you work hard or are blessed to have some money, you can always buy a pretty good family when you need it. Just as most jobs in America allow you to be fired 'without cause,' the 'bought and paid for' family probably can be reconstituted or released just as easily as Big Business does it. Finally, MLLERS gives outsiders a pretty good idea of how many ways there are to die in the Southwest: spider bites, car rollovers, industrial accidents, thirst, snakes, Border crossing, rock-slides, law enforcement, sexual identity misunderstandings, trespassing, drug deals gone wrong--and, of course, my favorite: stray bullets.",8,0,2,7 November 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Hermione never had it so bad . . .
",". . . and by that I mean that when I was growing up my favorite VHS tape was a ratty ol copy of ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN. So presumably all witches go to Hogwarts, but Mina dident seem to know the first thing about the 'executio' spell (or whatever that one was called that killed the other student, such as Harry's first girlfriend's older dude crush). I mean, Mina apparently spends all her time traipsing around the woods going 'la-dee-da-dee da' and crashing in the basement of Gretel's old place at dusk (when it is time for the Slytherin witches to ride their brooms over the forest, looking for prey). So when she somehow falls into the hands of Augsburg's witch savant sheriff (who even can sniff out the white witches), and he asks her if she wants the original crust or extra crispy, she's not even bold enough to ask for a side of mac and cheese?! Paying tuition at the half-blood rate, her dad could have demanded a refund for this lack of hoo-hah on her part (had he been around by then). At least Muriel seemed to have done her homework in Snape's class, as she has the asbestos-skin formulation down pat. However, if you think Joy Killer Rawling was hard on us muggles, stay away from HANSEL & GRETEL!!!",7,3,7,27 January 2013
Gone with the Wind," A good friend told me that this is the most boring . . .
",". . . flick of All Time, so when I noticed a copy in the dumpster behind a defunct Blockbuster store I was understandably cautious. GONE WITH THE WIND is too lengthy to be crammed onto just one DVD; it's divided between TWO discs. I decided to make use of the 'Scene Selection' feature, and scanned this menu on Disc One for something sounding worthy of my attention. Let's review Scene #25 (of 400 or so) to determine if GWTW merits a week of your time. Running 4 minutes, 32 seconds, 'ATLANTA BURNING' begins about 1:22:57 into this cinematic marathon. A dude and a wench are descending a shadowy staircase, and the dame stammers 'Why, what--what's that?!' as she clumsily anticipates 'Mrs. O'Leary's' cow by dropping the lantern she's carrying. Since Georgia's capital always has been infamous for being a rat's nest tinder box, most of the city then explodes in a gargantuan conflagration three minutes later. Then the chagrined geezer accompanying the arsonist bimbo remarks 'It's a historic moment: One day you can tell your grandchildren how you burned down the Old South tonight.' Soon the Neighborhood Watch folks seem on the verge of bringing the Lady Firebug to Justice, but her henchman viciously drives them off with his whip. If this sounds like your cup of julep, go jump into GWTW's Lake of Fire. But if you're a normal person, you might be better off watching something more tasteful, such as THE ARISTOCRATS or THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE.",6,0,8,13 April 2019
1917," When the general dispatches the two lance corporals on their 9-kilometer run . . .
",". . . with a vital message during World War One, those viewers in the audience with either cross country or marathoning experience will be sure to brace themselves for the grueling ordeal ahead. The beginning of this WWI trek commences in slow motion, not unlike film footage of the Boston Marathon's annual onset, during which it takes some competitors about half an hour to cross the starting line AFTER officials yell 'Go!' However, once the corporals get their lances in gear, their quest begins to take on the guise of a cross country event, complete with unexpected obstacles (such as broken bridges or army trucks mired in the mud) and life-threatening narrow escapes. As I grew up, one of my uncles devoted much of our summer visits to regaling us with his foot race 'war stories.' For instance, one time he led the first five miles of a marathon in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, he had started out too fast, and passed out a couple blocks from the finish line--somehow running TWO MILES in the opposite direction and then waking up in the back seat of a Philly police squad car! When 'William' has the shootout with the German sniper by the broken bridge and is knocked unconscious for several hours, I was reminded of my uncle's experience.
During my relative's NEXT marathon in the City of Brotherly Love, he felt himself beginning to lose it again after 22 miles. Just then a senior citizen veered off the road next to the race course, snapping off a light pole. My uncle dropped out of the race, turned off the geezer's car engine (where the vehicle had come to rest in some bushes) and waited for the Authorities to arrive. In 1917, the lance corporals also face problems created by the arrival of a crashing vehicle (the shot down Prussian plane). My uncle said that during his first marathon, another competitor thought someone hit him in the head with a rock. When this guy finished, he had a stray hunter's bullet lodged in his skull! William finishes his 9K jaunt with several bullets in his body (most of them not so stray!). Then, of course, there's the Boston Marathon Bombing, which runners in the movie theater will instantly think of as the booby trapped bunker begins to explode during 1917. Bottom line: this film illustrates why ALL road racers and cross country harriers--no matter how poor--should be packing heat during their events, so go watch 1917, and then generously support your local chapter of BANGS (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps).",10,1,4,17 January 2020
The Artist," It is a little hard to put into words . . .
",". . . onz feelings when a one-trick pony stunt movie such as THE ARTIST is voted upon by 6,000 Hollywood insiders as the BEST PICTURE of an entire year?! Surely it was not the only 2011 movie that had a cute dog in it. Do they automatically give the 'best' picture award to whichever film has the best marketing people? Doesn't this duplicate the CLEO awards? Maybe THE ARTIST could sneak into onz top five for the year, but to place it at the very pinnacle of success seems a poke in the eye of the average American movie goer. When they expanded the nominations list for best picture from the five it had been set at since the 1940s to a maximum of 10, they said this would guarantee that at least a few of the movies average Americans actually saw and found entertaining would get nominated, such as Bat Man, Superman, Iron Man, X-Men, James Bond, Star Trek, Star Wars, Die Hard, Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games-type movies. Instead, we get even WORSE nominees than when the limit was five--and the tenth rung movies are MORE LIKELY TO WIN now that they are on the ballot. This just proves that the Hollywood people try to elect the movie they feel will make the American public either 1)the angriest, or 2)the most puzzled. Watch THE ARTIST and decide for yourself which of these goals the millionaires were going for with their votes in 2011.",7,0,2,3 February 2013
Whiplash," Drummers exposed in this Loserpalooza . . .
",". . . as the Achilles Heel of any musical group. Subject to inattention, reckless behavior, and mutiny, percussionists can be considered a 'necessary evil' at best. At worst, their Sociopathic behavior gets others maimed and killed. Throughout human history, drummers have been tapped to march soldiers to their deaths. The executioner's cue always has been the drum roll. 'Andrew,' the main character of WHIPLASH, is habitually late to his band practices. WHIPLASH shows Andrew on one such occasion speeding 80 mph in a 25 mph school zone, causing a horrific multi-vehicle crash. Fortunately, 'Nicole'--Andrew's short-term girlfriend--wises up and ditches him for a normal guy. I've personally hung out with marching band types all my life (as they make better conversation than the rest of the people around here, who've suffered countless concussions playing with their pigskins). Band folks are great pals, except drummers. The only drummer 99% of Americans can name is Ringo Starr, who is considered the 'black sheep' of the Beatles. No one has even heard of 'the greats' Andrew tries to emulate in WHIPLASH, since most of them died broke, as Andrew himself admits here. Bang the drum slowly, and give me baseball any day!",9,2,4,19 November 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman, get your gun . . .
",". . . is the main theme of the current release, BIRDMAN. A wonderful spoof of Broadway, BIRDMAN updates that old 'Things go better with Coke' ad line for the 21st Century to 'things go better with guns.' In a week where many at the Real Life aggrieved shooting site high school in Washington state are tweeting that the shooter 'was just a misunderstood angel,' BIRDMAN deftly captures the zeitgeist of today by showing that guns are the answer to many of America's pressing problems, whether you're talking Ebola, borders, or Broadway critics. But there's good news and bad news on this front. The good news is that we already have more than one firearm per capita in private hands. The bad news is that they're unevenly distributed. When Ed Norton makes fun of Michael Keaton's original stage gun in BIRDMAN and orders him to get another one, I was very worried. Keaton's BIRDMAN character did not seem to have the wherewithal to pick up a decent replacement weapon. In a typical Hollywood ending, however, he finds a serviceable six shooter on the top shelf of his dressing room just in the nick of time. Unfortunately, in Real Life, many poor Americans do not benefit from such a Deus Ex Machina. Last month the United Nations ordered the city of Detroit--bankrupt because most have not paid their water bills in decades--to turn the spigots back on since 'free water is a basic human right.' Well, our Declaration of Independence says the same thing about guns in the second paragraph, so please support your local chapter of BANGS (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps) today! (If you're hesitant, ask yourself: What Would BIRDMAN Do?)",10,6,14,28 October 2014
The Wolverine," Whose origin story is it, anyway???
","It was bad enough cringing through Tom Cruise as THE LAST SAMURAI in 2003, but THE WOLVERINE just takes the cake for Kow-Towing to the continent of Asia just because it has more people than the land masses wherein English is spoken, and just because they've purchased most of America's institutions (including Hollywood), and just because they might buy more movie tickets for THE WOLVERINE (if you count sales for dubbed and subtitled versions). But please Louise, next thing you know we'll be hearing that Japan WON WWII. Of course, if you watch this flick and read between the lines, you'll probably be coming out of the multiplex thinking that they DID. After seeing Wolverine's earlier films, it's clear that his origin story should be taking place during a time period such as the American Civil War. To say that an American super hero was created by Americans nuking a P.O.W. camp full of Americans is the height of absurdity. It almost sounds like something you would read in one of those mindless comic books, if they still came with captions!",8,1,5,20 October 2013
Casino Royale," When will these racists cast a Black Agent 007 . . .
",". . . as the English invented the Slave Trade, and that would be a very tiny gesture of atonement. Because, ask yourself, has there been a Black Prime Minister? No. Has an English Crown Prince ever married a Black? No again. So the least reparation England can make is to cast a Black James Bond. But no, these bigots have no problem arbitrarily rewriting American CIA agent Felix Leiter's part for Jeffrey Wright, but apparently they would never think of Mr. Wright for Bond's plum role, which was equally vacant in 2006 when CASINO ROYALE hit the screens. This despite the fact that most Black British Empire actors speak 'the Queen's English' far better than the White blokes in TRAINSPOTTING (if not QEII herself). Plus, I've seen all the screen tests trotted out as Bond 'Ultimate Edition Extras,' and I've listened to all the Bond insiders blabbing about their casting shenanigans, and it's clear the Eon Company is NOT color-blind when it comes to casting Bond. Agent 007's theme music might sound more appropriate for SHAFT than a string of a half dozen White guys, but when it comes to being Bond, Blacks get shafted!",7,2,7,2 November 2014
Unbroken," Can it be JUST a coincidence . . .
",". . . that the authors of 'A day that will live forever in infamy' make Dick Cheney look like a bleeding heart torturer in UNBROKEN? (This flick shows that one day of Japanese P.O.W. abuse is worse than a month of Cheney's spa-like water treatments and elevator Muzak.) Can it be just a coincidence that UNBROKEN's end credits state that 'Louie's' lead torturer, 'The Bird,' remained unrepentant to the bitter end, and that American roads are clogged today with shrapnel-spewing Takata airbags, and Kamikaze Toyota runaway cars with 'misprogrammed' on-board computers? Can it be just a coincidence that Angelina Jolie, the world's leading humanitarian, takes dead aim at the Japanese Death Culture in UNBROKEN? Can it be just a coincidence that most, if not all, Japanese vowed to fight on to an Ulitimate Victory past any formal ending of WWII, and that their Trojan Horse imports have now virtually succeeded in impoverishing the American Middle Class? Can it be just a coincidence that UNBROKEN debuts Christmas Day, with its 'Onward, Christian Soldiers' theme?",8,1,6,14 January 2015
