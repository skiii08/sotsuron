Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," funny but not worth owning
","Despite all the hype this movie is very funny in parts with a not so new approach to making a movie or comedy sketch- the unwitting victim or the inside joke. Candid camera did a solid job most of the time while others like Andy Kauffman failed miserably (I found Kauffman uncomfortable to watch). Saccha Cohen does a much stronger job of the put on, some visuals are in fact inspired, however I don't honestly think many of the people on the screen were out of the loop in terms of the punchline. There were too many camera angels in spaces where a camera would be too conspicuous. Also many characters are in fact character actors and the entire scene with Pamela Anderson is unrealistic if it were not a put on. Now the fact that it is not completely unscripted is fine with me (just as Blair Witch was not really a lost student film) however because of this Cohen turns a film seemingly about American culture vs third world culture into a long journey about finding real love over infatuation. It is just so uneven- so much of the film is about culture clash that he completely missed the point of his own premise. Yes this is a funny film yes some parts are very funny but after you've seen it there is nothing extra to make you want to see it over and over. Cohen could have added a bold observation like CRASH or taken us on a journey for love (instead of Americans looking for internet brides we have a 3rd world man looking for an American bride) but instead he takes us from 60 to 0 in 2.1 seconds. It's not that I didn't like the film I just didn't love it.",6,0,2,6 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Tom Cruise as action hero is a Mission Implausible
","O.K., o.k. after much argument I finally saw MI3 (as if I hadn't seen enough of Cruise the last six months) and all I can say is Kevin Costner had fewer close ups in WATERWORLD. Tom Cruise has surprised me in some roles ie RAINMAN and MAGNOLIA but he is not an action film star no matter how often he tries to subject us to it. Maybe he should do the research and come to terms with his limitations. And speaking of limitations I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman sounded more like a man with a cold than a hip sadistic villain. Hoffman whom I enjoy watching in anything from 'Happiness' to 'Capote:' was more of a heal in 'Scent of a Woman' than here in MI3. The script lacked originality and sharp punchlines to break up the monotony of 'Tom Sure Shot Cruise' shoot outs. I love a good shoot out- even if it's over the top- but I was not caught up in these. Also I could see in my minds eye Tom Cruise insisting he finally get a 'good bridge scene' in his action movie and jumping up and down on his producer couch after reading the 'bridge scene' inclusion in the MI3 script. It didn't help!! Maybe a director with more vision could have done a better job Unfortunately the director was JJ Abrams who despite the budget found a way to make this scene and in deed the entire movie dull, more of the same and implausibly laughable where it shouldn't have been. Was it the fact that the star was the producer of the movie that limited JJ?? or that the star so intent on forcing the issue of action hero and close ups could only find a director who was leadable and therefore lacking vision hence JJ Abrams. Tom!! you're not as talentless as I thought you were 20 years ago but get a grip on the reality of yourself- if you can do it for Brook Sheilds surely you can turn the mirror inwards- give the audience what they want instead of what you hope to shove(L) on them.",4,2,4,5 May 2006
3:10 to Yuma," fantastic dialogue
","This film not only has great acting by two ultra-fine professionals in Bale and Crowe but has wonderful dialogue that unravels the story and explains the action taken by each character. Logic would dictate one to ask why Crowe is running across alley ways and riding quickly with the posse toward the gallows- but the dialogue explains all of it while creating a larger scope of who these characters are. The dialogue was wonderful and concise in so many aspects. In fact, there are 3 or 4 separate verbal exchanges Christian Bales' character has that so perfectly develops the essence of the character I can not describe it as anything less than poetry! This film is excellent and is no boundaries for which audience would appreciate it- it is a great date film regardless of age or gender.",9,1,2,11 September 2007
The Da Vinci Code," a darn good mystery -a darn good movie
","I never read the book so I had the awesome privilege of not having any clue what to expect from the film. To me the worst thing any movie goer could gripe about is: '...it ain't as good as the book..' you know -the typical complaint against any movie made from a best selling novel. Otherwise,I have no idea why the critics hated this movie!! Probably to be different from the hype (a last ditch effort of balding flabby gutted non film makers trying to be off beat and radical) Admittedly this film has little action so if you need CGI and explosions in your ADD existence then it's true, this film is not for you. However, if you enjoy watching a mystery unravel before you this movie is about excellent. The pacing is faster than an early 1970's film but slower than say LAST BOY SCOUT. But I never found myself fidgeting in my seat or turning my cel phone back on. The characters are well developed and done so quickly enough so as not to keep you wondering why they are the way they are. Also the acting is very convincing. The film is written well enough to add a chuckle here and there without making a farce of the atmosphere. Also the writer doesn't make the main character a super genius amongst a band of idiots. Personally, I feel, being the film is set mainly in France had Ron Howard added subtitles, cut scenes without thought and paced it even slower he'd have ensured the critics of today to taught it as inspired and a masterpiece. Seriously, the only problem I had with the movie at all was that I guessed the mystery half way through the film. Yet despite that I thought it was great and I would gladly sit through it again. Please don't let this fall by the way of THE ALAMO or TROY it is definitely worth the watch.",7,0,2,19 May 2006
