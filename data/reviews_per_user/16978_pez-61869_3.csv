The Legend of Bagger Vance," if you liked 'The Natural' you may well like this
","I was looking for something a little different to watch, and a golf movie that wasn't like Caddyshack was different to me.I enjoyed the old cars, the shops, the attention to the background detail. I have no idea if it is historically realistic, but it was great for a story.Close to the end, I felt that it reminded me of another sporting movie, The Natural, and then I found that Robert Redford was the director.I really enjoyed this story, it kept me involved to the end. Will Smith was different to the usual brash character he plays, though still with his own flair and very good, Matt Damon can do anything and do it well, and while Charlize Theron didn't have as big a role, I felt her contribution added the final touches to an interesting story. It makes me want to find the novel and see if it is as good.I thought I'd be able to put on a movie and fast forward a bit if it got boring, it wasn't. I watched every minute and at the end wished there was more of the story. Groovy movie.",10,1,2,17 March 2017
The Revenant," worth watching
","I originally thought a role such of this was out of DiCaprio's range. I was quite mistaken. He played the part very well, and to my uninformed eye, quite realistically. I felt quite involved with his struggle and liked the insight into the Indians interaction with the various invaders. The movie was interesting, and involving. It definitely deserves the M15+ rating but the violence didn't detract from the story line. It's worth watching, you truly feel involved with this interesting story.",9,0,0,8 December 2017
"McFarland, USA"," Fun, heartwarming movie
","I found this a really engaging and interesting movie.I'd like to feel that this is a bit of an insight into the town and its story, as so many other reviews have referred to the real story behind it. This adds to the flavour for me.I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the story, and I liked the way the team built a relationship and the coach played his part. It's like a few other movies, but still individual and interesting.The ending may be a little predictable, but I found this a fun tale, one I'd watch with the kids and probably watch again.A fun family movie.",9,1,1,29 January 2016
