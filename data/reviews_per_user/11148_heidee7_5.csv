The Avengers," A+ Easily my favorite movie of the year so far
","I loved The Avengers, it is easily my favorite movie of the year so far! It's the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards, that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality; in every sense an aesthetic experience. I loved the action scenes, special effects, and all, but I suppose what I loved best about it were the hilarious one-liners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud. There were so many of these, too many to count with my fingers, in fact. There was also one moment when I actually cried, but then that was just me. I tend to cry over everything. *Sheepish smile.*I was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess, but the writers managed to make a script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived, or as though they just forcibly slotted a story in just so a certain character could appear. The entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive whole.I was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to 'ship, as I had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when I watched their individual films in the years past. (Okay, not all of them, just Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.) But here's what I realized - The Avengers makes for an interesting study in finding out what a girl truly finds attractive in a man, depending on who she loves most among the heroes. Is it Captain America, the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the hero's noble heart? Is it Thor, the fierce, masculine man with rippling muscles, facial hair and deep throaty growl? Is it the Hulk, the reserved brainiac with a surprisingly endearing shy smile? Or it it Iron Man, the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist (in his own words)?I am not going to recap the story, just go watch it yourself! It will be worth every single penny, I tells ya!",9,11,22,17 July 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," enjoyed the twists and hilarious scenes
","I had absolutely no clue what the movie was going to be about, didn't even see any trailers of it. The title gave me the impression that it was another one of those mosaic movies ala Love Actually, but it's not. The movie revolves around just two guys - Cal and Jacob. Mostly Cal, though.I enjoyed it immensely, most especially the twists and the hilarious scenes. There was also a moment when a tear trickled down my cheek. I also couldn't believe that I did not recognize Josh Groban in the film. As I was watching it I was thinking, that guy is so familiar. Which film is he from? Turns out he's not from a film, because this is his first one (Though he has done some spots on TV, like Ally McBeal and Glee. Had no trouble recognizing him in those.) I didn't recognize him without his huge curly mane. I therefore conclude that hair has a huge impact on a person's appearance.And now that we got that out of the way, on to the spoilers.The story goes: Cal is out on a date with his wife of 25 years when she blurts out that she wants a divorce at the exact same time that he says he wants creme brulee. When she admits that she slept with another guy, he begs for her to stop talking and jumps out of their moving car when she rambles on.He moves out of their house and frequents a bar, blurting his miserable story out to anyone and everyone who would listen. Jacob, an expert ladies man, sees him and pities him, offering to help Cal find the manhood that he lost and vowing that his ex wife will rue the day that she gave up on him. He gives Cal a total makeover from his shoes down to his wallet (which had an annoying velcro opening that made a ripping noise every time he opened it). He then brings Cal along on all his bar conquests that end up with him bringing ladies home to bed. In time, Cal is ready and manages such a personality overhaul that he mirrors Jacob's success, enough to bed nine different women, when so far he had slept with only one woman in his entire life; his wife had been his teenage sweetheart.He sees his wife again during their son's parent-teacher conference and this is also when the first major twist happens - turns out their son's teacher was the first girl he hooked up with. And there goes his chance to get back together with his 'soul mate.'Meanwhile, Jacob is in bar moving in on another conquest when a rain-drenched Hannah who had previously rejected his advances swoops in and kisses him. Hannah had just come from a celebration where she thought her boyfriend (who is Josh Groban whom I didn't recognize as I mentioned earlier) was going to propose to her but it turns out he was just going to offer her a job in his law firm. Her anger with him had propelled her to do something crazy. She lets Jacob take her to his place so that she could 'bang' the hot guy who hit on her at the bar. She nervously asks him to take off his top and when she sets eyes on his abs, she goes, 'F***! It's like you're photoshopped!' When he asks her to take her own clothes off, she asks if they could dim the lights. They finally make it to the bedroom but as he is kissing her, she starts asking funny questions and they end up talking and laughing the entire night instead. This is the first time Jacob makes a personal connection with a girl, so he falls for her, and asks Cal's advice on what to do.Cal is still in love with his wife and secretly tidies up her garden at night so she wouldn't have to ask her other guy to do it for her. While he is in one of these sessions, he catches sight of her through the window as she walks into the living room to call someone... which turns out to be him. She says that she's in the basement and needs him to guide her through something. He knows that she is lying because he could see her, but he plays along. And that's when he realizes that she also still loved him, as she was just making up excuses just so she could talk to him. This was the moment when I was so touched that a tear rolled down my cheek.So Cal decides to follow his son's advice and fight for his soul mate, hatching a surprise for her. While he is in the middle of doing this, though, all hell breaks loose. His eldest daughter arrives with her new boyfriend who is none other than... Jacob. Both men are shocked at the revelation that Hannah is Cal's daughter. Then a friend of Cal's storms into the house looking for him because he had just seen his 17-year old daughter's naked pictures in an envelope addressed to 'Cal.' Cal had no clue that his kids' babysitter had been secretly in love with him while his 13-year old son was in love with her. Then the guy that Cal's wife cheated on him with shows up as well, and all the men end up trying to beat each other up. This was a laugh out loud scene.Everything works out well in the end, though. Love for the win! :)",8,2,4,4 September 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Another Marvellous Marvel Movie
","I am a huge fan of Marvel movies, so I wasn't about to let this one slip by. As expected, it did not disappoint. It is being touted as the best movie Marvel has ever made. Personally, I can't be sure about that because it's hard to choose, but I can say this with certainty: it is my favourite movie this year so far.It has all the following elements that I love in a Marvel movie:* Amazing action scenes * Awesome special effects * Good plot * Suspense (it had me biting my freshly manicured nails and I had to stop myself) * Twists (I can think of 3 major ones that had me go 'whoa.') * Hot actors (the Cap, Chris Evans, is sooo handsome! And those shoulders, wow!) * Humor (though this is more serious than the other Avenger movies) * Heart * Romance (just slight. There was more bromance, though, I think.)It's the kind of movie that both men and women would like. And kids, too. When I saw Captain America part 1, I thought Captain America is the most 'heroic' of all the heroes because he is very noble. This movie further cements that belief. Steve Rogers has the heart of a hero. (And the face of a god.)Just like in the first Captain America movie, I was in awe of all the amazing things he can do with that shield of his, which he uses not just for defense, which is what shields are for, but offense as well. I told my seat mate, 'That is not a shield, but an all in one gadget - weapon, vehicle, umbrella!'Also as always, the ending is set up for a sequel, and there are a couple of scenes after the credits, so make sure to stay for them. (We missed the second one again, dammit, Marvel.) And I'm getting quite good at spotting Stan Lee's cameo appearances in all the Marvel movies.I am purposely not discussing the story because I went in with zero idea on what it was going to be about, and that made the surprises more pleasant for me.",8,4,7,2 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Probably the best X-Men movie so far
","This is probably the best movie in the X-Men franchise. There is a great plot that brings the two worlds (past and present) of the X-Men movies together which means there are a whole bunch of cool characters whose amazing powers are beautiful to watch, especially in tandem. The special effects and fight scenes are awesome and well executed. It has a stellar cast as well, which includes my favorites Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, and James McAvoy.It also has the most hilarious scene I have ever seen in any X-Men film; it involves the character Peter (aka Quicksilver). He is in the film for just a short time but he was such a scene stealer (the same way he steals everything else, I now realize). The other scene stealer is Raven (aka Mystique) who has really amazing combat moves. Like, woah.The plot was based on a famous comic book story with the same name, but they had to make some adjustments in order to make it fit with the film universe. For example, in the comics, it was supposed to be Kitty Pryde who gets sent back to the past, but the Kitty Pryde of the movies wasn't even born in 1973. So they realized that it would have to be Wolverine, because he has a mutant healing factor and longevity, which means that the same actor could play him in the past and the future.That said, I don't think you need to watch the other X-Men films in order to enjoy this film, but if you did, it will definitely be more fun for you, as you can understand who the numerous characters are without having to resort to asking your seatmate or having to put up with her reacting to everyone with gasps, namedrops and background stories in hurried confusing whispers (I am the seatmate in this scenario, by the way). You might want to stay put after the credits, as there is a short scene that shows a glimpse of what the next X-Men film will be all about.",8,1,4,2 June 2014
Cars," touching film...one of my favorites for 2006
","The movie is made by Pixar, the creators of another one of my favorite films, Finding Nemo. In this new film, they make cars come to life like real human beings. The story revolves around Lightning McQueen, a cocky hotshot race car. Enroute to California to compete for the Piston Cup, he gets lost in Radiator Springs, destroying their main road. The sheriff sentences him to fix the road before he can leave and head on to his race. At first, Lightning, like the arrogant self-important person -- err -- car that he is, looks upon this job with resentment and does a bad job. But as he gets to know Sally, Doc Hudson, Mater, and the other cars, he too falls in love with the town and realizes that life is about enjoying the journey, and not the frantic race to the finish line.In the end, I was in tears. No, no cars died in this film, to answer my friend's question. The final race scene was just so touching. Something straight out of Chicken Soup for the Soul. So what are you waiting for? Go!",Null,4,6,2 July 2006
