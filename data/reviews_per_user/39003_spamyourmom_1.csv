Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Should've kept it to ONE volume.
","I generally like this guy's movies. I loved RD, liked PF, forgave JB, and liked KBv1 again. I was actually expecting good stuff to happen in this second part. After watching it, I'd be hard pressed to mention a single moment in the movie that made me think it was worth splitting into two episodes. The overall feel is that he HAD to throw in every gag, reference, character and cameo he could, and then repeat some of them until you winced. Tarantino at his best is like a hyper, geeky-funny friend who makes good weird jokes. Tarantino in Kill Bill 2 is like the know-it-all geek friend who talks to himself in Klingon and quotes from cheesy movies only he has seen, all through the roadtrip. There comes a point where you just wish he'd shut up and do a crossword puzzle or something. The first part had great visual moments and awesome fight sequences: the battle against the Crazy 88's - (the part silhouetted against the blue backdrop stands out), the motorcycle scenes in Tokyo, the fight with O-Ren Ishi. Volume 2? I'll mail you a lolly if you mention one memorable take that doesn't feel lifted from somewhere. I was looking forward to buying the DVD for KBv1. Now I'm not so sure... have only half the movie, or buy a lousy DVD just to have the whole deal?",Null,0,1,24 May 2004
