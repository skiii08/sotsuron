Requiem for a Dream," Sweet Jesus
","I actually BOUGHT the DVD.. Thought Leto would be real nice in this one. But my God i was wrong. This was THE most depressing piece of .... i have ever seen. Sure, it's a plot, good actors, but come on.. this was maybe the biggest mistake i've ever done. I'm sitting here eating breakfast, and watching this diabolic sex-drugabuse-sad-depressing-feel-bad-for-everyone movie. Watch it if you're suicidal, it will help you make your decition. For everyone else, avoid it. I can not understand how this is rated 8.9, that is beyond my imagination. I cant say it was all bad, that would be a shame. Pretty much all the actors are very convincing, and you might just get crazy yourself. Despite of the very good cast, this movie stinks. So, to sum up. Actors, great. Movie, very very very bad.",Null,4,8,30 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Willy Wonka is Michael Jackson
","I love this movie, maybe the first thats better then the book. What hit me during the scene in the elevator, when Willy had a flashback of him and his father after some trick or treat... Was that Willy Wonka is exactly as Michael Jackson. He does what he never could as a kid, and he is, when you think about it, almost as weird as Jackson about his lost childhood/candy eating. Talking like a kid, nothing have to make sense, and he just loves everything that has to do with candy. He invites small children over for a look at the chocolate empire of his. This is not meant in a negative way. The resemblance was too obvious for me to even try to ignore. The movie was GREAT. Anyone else thought of this, or am i all alone?(Posted as spoiler, people might want to figure this things out by themselves, if you have something like this to think about while watching the movie, it's kind of annoying.)",Null,0,2,17 September 2005
