The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Awful
","Ok, so I'm not a Kieslowski fan (although I liked his Ten Commandments a lot): reader, be advised. But this must be the most boring film I've ever seen (and I've seen many). I swear I was well awake when I hit the play button of my VCR. One hour later I had to struggle to keep my eyes open; because, I thought, I will get the sense of this movie, sooner or later. That never came! I didn't feel anything for, or learn anything from, Veronika or Veronique, except that they are two girls played by the same actress. Where's the beauty of this all? The filtered photography? The pointless coincidences? The lost looks in Jacob's face? Nice actress, but I looked that lost many times and that didn't make a movie out of my bad day.You know people say 'I want my two hours back'? I thought it was an expression, but with this film I really felt that way. Better, I was honestly furious at the screenwriter and myself, for having been cheated.",1,31,76,21 January 2000
Forrest Gump," Great view on 3 decades of American history
","I wasn't born and raised in the U.S., and I loved this movie as an involving, touching, yet sober view on three decades of American history. I'm led to think that pure-breed Americans (especially if in their fifties now) must have loved it even more. Anyway, the historical events of a country mingled with the personal life of this naive but strong character make for a great narrative device. Excellent movie for everybody.",10,0,2,23 July 1999
Meet Joe Black," not recommended
","If you're a guy and don't know how to spend those 3 bucks in your pocket, then rent the video and admire splendid Claire Forlani. If you're a woman you can find much better movies featuring Brad Pitt. Hardly anything else is in there. Too bad Anthony Hopkins couldn't save this flick.",4,2,4,23 July 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," hard to describe
","It's hard to describe why this movie is great: it just sucks you in. It might take more than one vision, but there is something about the story (and the excellent filming) that gets you in touch with that part of yourself that is still wondering what we are doing in this universe. Not a Star Trek kind of a movie.",10,1,3,23 July 1999
