Blade Runner 2049," Nearly perfect sci fi movie.
","Almost perfect, the beginning is so powerful. Ryan acting is so good. The atmosphere is one of the kind. There are so many things this movie is trying to communicate, for example, if replicate just like human being? discrimination problem, love with a digital being but it has emotion. There are a little bit flaw. If you want to fully enjoy this movie, you have to understand it is a story about K's journey. Other things is not so important and do not need to be bluntly explain. Also the ending of this movie is not to resolve good and evil in this world, it's about K.
But scenes related to Wallace seems very shallow and like it is there just to connect the story. Especially the part near the end. Also if you didn't watch the previous blade runner, I am not sure how much will this affect the viewer to understand this movie. I do watch the previous one, so I wouldn't know. But I think it does make a difference at some degree.It is not perfect, but I think it is a must watch if you like sci-fi.",9,1,5,4 January 2018
Passengers," A romance tale wrap in sci-fi cover.
","first off, if you are expecting a sci-fi movie, you should be disappointed, nearly every sci-fi aspect design fails, contradictions everywhere.second thing, the first 20 minutes just filled with boring and unnecessary footage.last thing, the story is so simply, with so few characters, it should be more than enough to express everything in 30 minutes.",5,0,1,23 May 2017
Avengers: Endgame," It is a hard 11
","Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all.
A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11.",10,32,49,31 July 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Director's cut is not bad
","In short, I have to say, the movie is trying to include too much stuff thus some crucial turning points result rush and sloppy.SPOILER ALERT!!!First problem is that the writer is trying too hard to analog Superman to Jesus, the spear thing making the fight awkward.Second problem is that how Batman and Superman resolve their conflict by yelling mother's name is a far stretch. If Lois shows up and give batman some information to figure out Superman is being framed, it would make more sense.Last problem is that they make batman looks like an angry middle aged nerd, but the character should be a smart detective.They could just write story to focus on the contrast of their background and believe in justice to create conflict, instead they decide to squeeze Lex Luthor in and make some unconvincing plot to manipulate both batman and superman, which is less appealing IMHO.",7,1,4,20 July 2016
The Martian," Too much Matt, the messages and the story are somehow disconnected
","The theme, costume, actor and actress are all great, 10/10. but I think the message about respecting nature, hope and fight for survival are somehow not align with how the story goes.How Matt work on communication feel way too easy and smooth, and what is so important about Jessica's disco much? the character doesn't even show up more than 5 minutes, and that is a huge waste of Jessica being in this movie. and others like Chiwetel, are too having too little time, which makes all other characters feel bland. Viewers would be wondering why those 5 people are willing to risk their life trying to save that one guy. And two useless love relation, Jessica's and Kate Mara's. That kiss doesn't have anything to do with the story, etc.if there is a director's cut like 4 hours length, could be much better.",8,1,5,1 November 2015
