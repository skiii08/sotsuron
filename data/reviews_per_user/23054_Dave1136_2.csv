The New World," Do you enjoy watching paint dry or grass grow? Take your pick!
","This film is sooooooooooooooooo slow moving.......if you ever have problems sleeping, buy this movie! I had to stay awake just to see the conclusion. It was entertaining but too much wasted time telling this very romantic love story. It was 125 minutes but with good editing could be told in 95 to 100 minutes. That makes a big difference! Colin Farrell & Christian Bale's love sick expressions were warm and sensitive but after the 400th time it was annoying.There are good things about this film: Christopher Plummer always adds authenticity to films......Q'orianka Kitcher was perfectly cast as Pocahontas. She looked very Native American and was really lovely! Good to see Wes Studi again, star of 'Geronimo: An American Legend'. Background and scenery was entertaining as was the story of early America.Worth seeing if you can just get by the slow parts. Probably worth a 5 or 6 out of 10.",Null,9,14,17 June 2006
Passengers," One of the best SciFI films ever made!
","This will be a short review.I have been watching films since the Thirties. I have only 287 films I would rate as OUTSTANDING. This in number 288! The acting, story, and direction is truly outstanding. Even if your not a SCIFI individual you will still love this film. Pure entertainment!!!",10,4,6,10 July 2017
