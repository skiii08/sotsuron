Miracle," Inspiring and True
","'Miracle' is one of my favorite movies. It is not only a true, inspirational sports stories but a fine film. Kurt Russell turns in his best performance as Herb Brooks, the coach of the 1980 U.S. hockey olympic team.Brooks is determined to beat the Soviets. They have dominated olympic hockey for years, technically amateurs, but really pampered professionals who dominate and intimidate their opponents.The hockey players (actors) are truly amazing. Brooks slowly molds them into a cohesive unit--no easy task considering they are college kids and rivals in the hockey world.There is one great scene after another, but one of my favorites is where Brooks tells them how they can defeat the Russians--'You don't defend against them; you attack them.' Patricia Walker is also good, playing Brooks' wife, Patti, whose loyal support he needs desperately.There is a good follow-up at the end of the movie telling what happens to the individual members of the team.Great entertainment for the entire family!",9,1,1,13 December 2012
Skyfall," Updated Bond Scores a Hit
","Daniel Craig as Bond is superb in this latest Bond flick. He is the quintessential 21st century Bond, cool, competent, but showing some scars from his past--physical and psychological. There may not be as many gadgets in this film, but all the other elements are there suspense, car chases,and death defying shootouts.Javier Bardem is as evil as it gets, remorseless, relentless, and laughing at the world as he does his terrible deeds.Judy Densch as 'M' is the target this time as is MI6 itself.Bond who has been given up for dead, must come to the rescue.We learn a bit about Bond's past in this one. He is a little more human.All in all Skyfall is a satisfying movie experience.",8,8,18,14 February 2013
Lone Survivor," Great Action Flick
","'Lone Survivor' does not disappoint in its depiction of a group of Navy Seals who fight off scores of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Confronted at the beginning of their mission with the dilemma of letting three goatherds go and risking the compromising of their mission or killing them - they let them go. The subsequent loss of all of the four Seals but one, Marcus Lutrell, and the killing of 16 of their comrades in a helicopter crash trying to rescue them is the crux of the movie.The movie is fast paced and well acted. It is very difficult to become a Seal. They put to use all of their special training trying to survive. The physical wounds of war are excruciating to watch. Mark Wahlberg is good as the Texan, Marcus Luttrell, who grittily clings to life after being given sanctuary by a group of friendly Afghan villagers and who is still pursued by the relentless Taliban.Adults and adolescents will like the film, but small children would be well advised to give it a pass.",8,2,10,21 January 2014
The Impossible," Beautiful Movie
","A British family spending Christmas in Thailand endures the tsunami which devastated much of the coastline in 2004. Based on a true story of an actual Spanish family this is much more than a natural disaster film.The father and two younger sons are separated from the mother and oldest boy. Maria, the mother, is severely injured. She and Lucas end up in a hospital where she awaits surgery and is near death.Meanwhile, Henry, the father, refuses to leave and continues searching for his family.The devotion this family shows toward each other is very moving. There is also great depiction of the actual disaster. The acting is top notch including the children.Highly recommended.",10,1,3,5 May 2013
42," Wonderful Blast From the Past
","42 is an excellent movie sure to please audiences. It contains fine acting by Chadwick Boseman who plays Jackie Robinson and Harrison Ford, playing Branch Rickey.I enjoyed the nostalgia of the early 50's ambiance so well depicted in the film. Civil Rights have come a long way since the days of 'Whites and Colored Only.' Segregation was much more a fact of life then than it is now.The story itself is known to many. Jackie Robinson was the first black to break the color line in baseball. He definitely had guts because abuse was heaped upon him from all sides. Even his own Dodger teammates were ambivalent about playing with him.He succeeded by never quitting, not losing his temper, and just being a bang-up baseball player. It didn't hurt that he was also a fine human being.Highly recommended for all.",9,0,0,15 May 2013
Argo," Authentic and Riveting
","I felt as if I was in 1979 Iran as I watched this fine movie. Ben Afflect who plays a CIA operative posing as a film producer, has proved himself again an excellent director after his previous directorial debut, The Town.Six Americans, having escaped their own embassy where 60 or so Americans are being held hostage, are depending upon Afflect to get them safely out of Iran.The cooperation of the Canadians was key to this effort. The six hide in the Canadian ambassador's official residence while mobs scream, 'Death to America.' Affect has to convince the authorities that he is scouting locations for a movie, Argo.My friend and I really enjoyed this fast paced, well acted, well directed film.",9,2,4,21 October 2012
The Town," Great Action and Acting!
","Ben Allflect directs and stars in 'The Town,' a gritty drama about Charlestown, MA and its tradition of bank robbers. Afflect plays Doug McCray, the brains of the gang, and Jeremy Renner is Jem, his main sidekick and real hard case. There are four members of the gang and they professionally carry out bank robberies around Boston systematically burning all evidence. They always have air tight alibis.The gist of the story is Doug's growing love for Claire Keasy, the bank manager of a bank they have held up. She is taken hostage and is traumatized by the experience. Doug attempts to deflect any inclination she may have to provide evidence to the FBI by getting to know her but doesn't count on his developing real feelings for her.This situation and how it is resolved make up the guts of the movie. It is fast paced and realistic with some scenes of real violence.'The Town' is not for young children, but adults and older adolescents will enjoy this finely made film.",9,2,5,16 December 2012
Hugo," Enchanting
","I loved this movie. It is meticulously made as to set, score, characters, and plot. The story is of Hugo, an orphan living in a Paris train station. He is trying to restore an automaton left to him by his dead father. Every day he winds the clocks and hides from the inspector who will send him to an orphanage if he catches him.The story unfolds seamlessly and includes just enough surprises to make the viewer never lose interest. The back story which depicts the early pre World War I film making lends texture and believability to the ephemeral plot.Highly recommended to the discerning movie goer; although, it is not strictly for children.",10,3,6,10 March 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Not Jackson's Best
","Fantasy lovers will have a hard time disliking Peter Jackson's newest Hobbit film. I have read the books and seen all the LOTR movies. Loved them all. I have to say this newest one is a disappointment. There are mega special effects, all very well done, but little characterization. It seems there is just one battle scene after another. I don't have a problem with Jackson straying from the actual Hobbit story line. But there is very little story here.The dragon, Smaug, is very well done as is his voice. Better luck next year, Peter. I look forward to the last of your Hobbit trilogy. Middle Earth is a great place to hang out.",6,3,4,25 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Can't Get Enough of This Series!
","Hobbits, wizards, dwarfs, elves, trolls, goblins, and dragons adorn this wonderful movie. I have read The Hobbit and all three of the Lord of the Rings books more than once. I am also aware of the complaints that Peter Jackson did not follow the story exactly. So what! He understands the spirit of Tolkien exactly. He has high standards and meets them.This my first 3D movie. I was impressed! I really don't understand the negative reviews. I was held spellbound from beginning to end. Middle Earth has never looked so beautiful. The special effects are astounding.Some very effective scenes were the battle against the goblins and the troll fight.The guy who plays Thorin Oakenshield is great. All the dwarfs are just as I would have imagined them.I have missed there being no LOTR movies at Christmas. Now we get to look forward to two more Hobbit movies.Cheers.",10,4,13,18 December 2012
Gran Torino," Grand Experience!
","This movie starts slowly and builds as it goes along to a satisfying and unexpected climax. Walt Kowalsky (Clint Eastwood) is a just widowed Korean war veteran. He is a retired auto worker and has lived in the same neighborhood for 40 some years. It is a changing neighborhood with Hmong immigrants, other minorities, and some gangs. Walt has no use for any of these changes. He is an embittered man. After a visit to a doctor, he finds out he is probably dying of cancer.Reluctantly, Walt becomes involved with his Hmong neighbors. He chases away some gang members who are harassing Thao and his sister Sue. The Hmong family is grateful; they grow on Walt in spite of himself.Eastwood carries the movie, but the Hmong brother and sister do their part.At the end Walt proves himself in his own way.",9,0,3,11 March 2013
Lincoln," Lincoln Comes to Life
","Painstakingly, historically accurate portrayal of the last months of Lincoln's life. This film is a wonderful history lesson for anyone over the age of 12. Even if you have studied Lincoln and read about him and his age, you will get to know him in a way that reading alone can't provide.Lincoln is shown as more than just a homespun country lawyer, but a passionate man of beliefs and an accomplished politician. He knows that in order to pass an amendment banning slavery, he is going to have to grease more than a few palms, and he does so. Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal if the definitive one of all the actors who have played Lincoln. Lincoln knew by the end of the war that slavery must be abolished once and for all permanently. The House followed the Senate in passing the 13th amendment, but it was a close thing and could have gone the other way without the right leadership.The sets, the actors, the attention to the smallest details of the period make this movie a treasure.",10,3,10,27 November 2012
Hoosiers," One of the Great Sport Movies
","I grew up near Northeastern Indiana on the Ohio side. Those fields are my fields, those skies are like the midwestern skies of my childhood. 'Hoosiers' is not only a great sports movie, it reflects the ambiance of the early 50's in midwestern farm country in a way few artistic efforts do. There is a quietness, a beauty of those times and those places that you don't see any more. Progress is great, but it is nice to remember where you came from.Gene Hackman does an outstanding job playing Norman Dale, coach of the Hickory Hoosiers. They are farm boys from a small Indiana town who play basketball as easily as some people ride a bycycle. Dale molds them into an unbeatable team who eventually win the state championship. He has a checkered past. This chance to coach a winning team is a redemption for him as well as a victory for the whole town.'Hoosiers' is a joy to watch and experience. Time hasn't dimmed its excellence.",10,0,0,18 July 2014
Les Misérables," Glorious!
","I've seen the new 'Les Miserables' twice. It was a glorious experience, moving and complete. Hugh Jackman is amazing as the ex convict, Jean ValJean. Kudos to the rest of the cast especially Anne Hathaway as Fantine. Jackman and Hathaway should both get Oscars for their performances.Russell Crowe is not much of a singer, but he does a good job portraying Inspector Javert as a complicated, driven man.The movie makes you think you are in France during the early 19th century with authentic scenery and great atmosphere.I never saw the stage version of 'Les Mis,' but I'm grateful to have had the opportunity of watching it with my daughter and two granddaughters, an 11 year old and a 15 year old.. We all loved it.",8,1,2,12 January 2013
The Holiday," Very Entertaining!
","Great acting, cute story, and great sets make 'The Holiday' stand out as a charming romantic comedy. Kate Winslett plays Iris, the British girl who suffers from unrequited love of her co-worker on a London newspaper. Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a Hollywood trailer maker disgusted and angry by her boyfriend's infidelity. These two exchange houses in a trans Atlantic swap over the holidays.The great thing about The Holiday is the way we can identify and relate to the main characters. All four leads are excellently portrayed. The sets are also excellent Amanda's Hollywood mansion and Iris's cottage.There are many great lines, The chemistry between the love interests is real.If you want light, satisfying entertainment, rent 'The Holiday.'",9,0,2,7 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Not a Bad Movie
","I wanted to like Zero Dark Thirty better than I did. It is a good film, but it takes a long time to get started. You never really feel like you know any of the characters. Jessica Chastain who plays Maya, the CIA agent who pursues Bin Laden down the years never reveals who Maya is, what drives her, why she is so obsessed with this pursuit.The movie didn't come alive for me until the final half hour, when the actual raid on Bin Laden's compound takes place. That is very exciting and very well crafted.The torture scenes at the beginning of the movie are tame compared to others I have seen. Why there was so much controversy over torture which never reveals anything valuable is a mystery.",7,0,3,20 March 2013
Draft Day," Edge of Seat Movie Not Just for Sports Fans
","Very well done and well acted. Kevin Costner and Jennifer Garner do a great job as General Manager and his assistant of the Cleveland Browns. I am not a football expert but that didn't keep me from enjoying every minute of Draft Day.Costner is playing a weak hand as he tries to revive his football team. He has a chance to get a first draft pick from the Seattle Seahawk but has to give up a lot to get him. That is far from the end of the story. As the day progresses deals are made and unmade. We get to know some of the football players, their agents, and the nail biting stress they feel as their future careers are on the line. This is an authentic, riveting and enjoyable glimpse of American pro football.",10,4,9,17 April 2014
