Insidious: Chapter 2," The sequel is better than the original
","I've become quite disillusioned by American horror movies. The glory days of your Evil Deads and Halloweens is long gone – the horror cinema we tend to see nowadays likes to rely more on cheap shocks than sustained terror. And in the off chance that a film comes along that is actually very scary (see: Saw and Paranormal Activity), it is buried into the ground after becoming a lacklustre franchise (see: Saw and Paranormal Activity). It looks like Insidious might be adding itself to the latter.Insidious: Chapter 2 picks up where the first one left off (so you might want to watch that first). It's the day after the night before, and everyone's a little bit shaken up. Husband Josh (Patrick Wilson) and wife Renai (Rose Byrne) think all their troubles are behind them, but all the hauntings and demons they thought they'd gotten rid of are still around. To uncover the issue, they have to go all the way back to Josh's childhood for answers.The problem with the first Insidious was that it was ridiculously disjointed. It was a fantastic first half of genuine terror and suspense, and an absurd second half of weirdly painted 'demons' and hokey plot points. Thankfully, writer Leigh Whannell sorts things out and we have a film with much more structure and narrative. Because it kicks off the day after the first one, we're thrust into it immediately. There's no need for the slow-burn set-up this time, which I think is both an advantage and a detriment.The advantage is that we go into fifth gear right from the start, so you always remain engaged. The detriment is that, sadly, Chapter 2 just isn't as scary as the first one. Yes, there are still those shocks when things appear suddenly; and they still generate a gasp, but it's just not as consistent. Chapter 2 isn't really about wanting to make you scared; I'd argue that it's really just about trying to make sense of the whole story. There is nothing wrong with that, and I think it's all explained quite competently, but that need to explain everything means the horror suffers.One other place where the second one trumps the first is the cast. Okay, so it's more or less the same cast as the second, but they're used much better here. Rose Byrne is as strong here as she is in the first, there's neither a drop or increase in quality. The quality increase comes from Patrick Wilson. I didn't really like him much in the first one, but he has more to work with here and does a good job. However, the best decision the filmmakers made was to make more use of Specs and Tucker. The double act are fantastic in their short stint in the first film, and are deservedly given more airtime in the sequel. Once again, they make the most of it.What bothered me most about Insidious: Chapter 2, though, is the ending. I won't tell you how the film develops, because it's impossible to do so without spoiling anything. However, I don't think it's really a spoiler to tell you that there will be a third film. Because, come on, they're all franchises now. And it's a shame, because it's inevitable that the quality level will drop with each new sequel that is made.But, let's not look to the future, and remain in the present. You should watch this accomplished horror movie, which is perhaps a bit short of spooks but is strong in character development and story progression. I would recommend that you watch the first one, because it's pretty crucial to the story, but this is definitely the stronger of the two outings.",7,0,1,14 September 2013
Skyfall," A blistering Bond masterpiece
","Fade to colour. It is a dark corridor, lit ever so slightly by lights coming through the window. There is only the shadowy outline of a figure at the end of the corridor. Slowly, he starts to pace forward, gun in his hand. He comes right up to the camera, light falling across his blue eyes. Those piercing blue eyes. Cue music. That music.That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Bond is back. James Bond.It's been exactly fifty years since James Bond first hit our screen in Dr No and even now, twenty-three movies later, the character creates the same amount of excitement and curiosity he did at the beginning. I'll freely admit that, while a casual fan of the movies, I was never a die-hard. I've only seen a few of them, and they were good. I'm aware of all the famous characters, the gadgets, the famous stories – I know it all, pretty much, just without seeing the films. But, importantly, I'd seen both of the first Daniel Craig movies. Loved them. A die-hard fan of them. And so watching movie number three was inevitable.Skyfall is actually a refreshing change of pace from those first two movies. While they both followed the same narrative, this goes back to an old-school standalone Bond storyline. Bond is accidentally shot and presumably killed during an attempt to get back a stolen list of all NATO secret agents, thrusting MI6 into a cyber-terrorist plot. Bond does come back, obviously, to find and stop the man behind it.I'll cut to the chase: this was unbelievably good. There were reservations about Sam Mendes directing it, because he'd never directed an action movie before, but he goes well above expectation. The action sequences, first up, are excellent. Frenetic, edge-of-your-seat sequences that, in true Mendes style, are shot beautifully.But what Mendes brings to Skyfall is character development. These aren't just archetypal characters there to fulfil the Bond formula (with one exception that I'll get to). Everyone has a purpose, and we learn about them and invest in them emotionally. Bond's own journey in the movie is excellent, as is that of M (Judi Dench) and, most notably Javier Bardem as Silva. I'll go as far as to say that Bardem could, and rightfully should, be nominated for an Oscar. The guy is immense; it'll be hard for me to compare to other iconic Bond villains having not seen those films, but Silva is the perfect antagonist. He steals every scene he is in, with one-liners as well as simple tuts and sighs. Fantastic.In truth, they're all great. Craig, Dench, Bardem, Ben Wishaw as Q, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes – Mendes has a cavalcade of top-notch actors and he makes good use of them. The only exception is Berenice Marlohe. As Severine, Marlohe is our Bond girl. And she is so underused and more or less irrelevant that I just didn't understand the need for her. Yes, they needed a Bond girl, so they had to have her. But I wish Mendes could have made better use of her. Ah well, no film can be perfect.Another aspect of the film that Mendes does so well is playing up the history and the stereotype of Bond without verging into satire. The iconic Bond car and gun are back, and there are numerous one-liners and wink-wink moments which only serve to enhance the story. This isn't the Bond that is nothing but serious and steely. This Bond incarnation from Craig has all the wit and charm people love from his predecessors.I won't go into spoiler territory, but some very important things happen in this movie. Like in The Dark Knight Rises, you're kept guessing until the very end. After what a lot of people consider a disappointing Quantum Of Solace, this is a blistering return to form. Again, no film can be perfect, but this came so close. Must-watch cinema.",9,4,18,29 October 2012
Spartacus," Truly an epic...
","Epic is a word that's always brought up when people talk about Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus'; and those people aren't wrong. Not even counting the fact that it's over three hours long (making it the longest movie I've ever seen), everything about this movie is grand. The locations, the imagery, the cast, the battle scenes – it is, without doubt, an opus.Spartacus is about, well, Spartacus, a slave during the Roman Empire. Always the rebel, Spartacus manages to escape from slavery and, together with the other slaves, starts a revolt. A rebellion turns into an army, and Spartacus is soon battling the entire Roman army.What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already? It's a stunning film, definitely one of the best period pieces in cinema history. Don't let the length of the movie fool you: yes, it's a bit of a chore getting through it, but your reward for persisting is a well-written, beautifully-shot, brilliantly-acted film. Deservedly so, everyone points to Kirk Douglas' performance as the titular hero; he is fantastic in it. I'd say, though, that other actors outshine him in the movie. In a small but emotionally charged role, Tony Curtis is brilliant. So too is Peter Ustinov as the greedy Batiatus. And we haven't even mentioned Jean Simmons and Laurence Olivier. This is a film made up of legends.What really resonates for me, though, is the aesthetics of the whole film. It's a visually pleasing film. Whether it's the gladiator training scenes, or the climactic battles at the end, Kubrick shoots them with such majesty and beauty. It's interesting that Kubrick directed this. This is the same man that gave us films like 'The Shining' and 'A Clockwork Orange', where everything is a little bit left of centre. Here, it's all played pretty straight up; it doesn't feel Kubrickian at all.But regardless, it is his movie, and he's made a brilliant one. I don't think it's the best Kubrick movie, but that's like saying 'Come Together' isn't the Beatles' best track. It could be, if there weren't so many other ridiculously good songs. I've seen a few 'epics' in my time during which I've fallen asleep halfway through. Take it for it's worth, but I didn't fall asleep during this.",9,1,3,27 October 2012
Gravity," One of the best films of the year....
","Me and 3D have never really got along. There isn't a lot of love there. When choosing between watching a film in 2D and 3D, I've always chosen the former, and always will do. But, sometimes, films come along that force you to choose 3D. Avatar for one – I fell asleep halfway through. Life Of Pi – pretty but needless. In short, I've never been blown away by it. IMAX is the future, in my opinion, but bloody expensive. 3D? it's a fad that will go away, just give it a few years.But, I implore you. Go and watch Gravity. And make sure you watch it in glorious 3D.Gravity, for those that don't know, is the new film from Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. Truth be told, I wasn't too aware of the name, but he has made some fantastic films in the past (Y Tu Mama Tambien; Children Of Men; Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban, to name a few). All of his best films have the same thing in common – visually, they're a treat to watch. One of the most powerful moments of Children Of Men, for example, is when blood splatters across the screen and just stays there on the lens. With this new film, though, Cuaron takes that talent to a whole new level.The film is unlike any other I have ever seen. Visually and viscerally, from the very first scene, it's a stunning watch. Very many excellent films have been made in the past about space, but Gravity is the first time that a movie actually takes advantage of the sheer distance and nothingness that space provides. It's full of beautiful long-shots, moving over the Earth, the stars, the space stations and debris around the place, and the people themselves. It's jawdropping; but as beautiful as it is, it's amazing just how terrifying it also becomes. As Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) hurtles helplessly through space, spinning uncontrollably and screaming for help, I was frightened. That fright was heightened by the use of 3D; this wasn't just objects needlessly flying off the screen at me; the 3D tricks were in context and meant something.Thankfully, what Cuaron manages to do very well is supplement the visuals with a very solid and emotional story. Bullock's character has gotten literally lost in space and is desperate to get home. But this is not just your usual sci-fi adventure flick – this is an emotional tale about hope, faith and (beyond all) the idea of letting go. Whether it's letting go of a traumatic experience, or simply letting go of a wire, it's a theme that runs throughout the movie and eventually sets us up for the exciting final third.At the heart of it is Sandra Bullock herself – as Ryan Stone, the veteran actress provides yet another excellent performance. You quickly forget that it's Bullock, so immersed she becomes in the role. Once again, the 3D plays a big part here; as she floats through space, we become her eyes, therefore creating a bigger bond between actor and audience.But while one actor enhances the film, the other one did a helluva job trying to bring it down. That's right – George Clooney. Now, I love Clooney, I think he's a wonderful actor and you can't help loving that Hollywood charm. Gravity, however, was not the vehicle for this charm. I found the character irritating and completely out of place. I understood the need for the role of Matt Kowalski, but perhaps with a different personality.The one-dimensional supporting character was made even more irritable because of the unintelligent script. A lot of the dialogue here was hokey and full of cliché, which was a little bit annoying. It wouldn't have been so annoying, had the other facets of the film not been so brilliant. They were, though, and I wish the script had been too.However, overall, Gravity is still a fantastic film. Clooney's performance really isn't that important in the grand scheme of things, and you're not going to watch this film for the great script. You should be watching Gravity for its ground-breaking use of special effects, it's changing of the way science fiction and 3D will be viewed in the future, and it's engaging story and strong central performance.Gravity is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best sci-fi movies in the last five years. Watch it. In 3D.",9,4,8,20 November 2013
As Good as It Gets," A fantastic film with a great lead performance
","A friendship starts to develop between a gay artist, a single mother working as a waitress, and a misanthropist, when the artist is left hospitalised after an attack. The three start to become somewhat dependent on one another, against their own expectations.'As Good As It Gets' is one of those movies that I remember seeing the trailer of, but never felt the need to see. Just seemed like a boring rom-com with actors I didn't really care about. 'As Good As It Gets' is, in fact, an incredibly funny and quirky movie that was fully deserving of the Oscars that it won. The script is the strong-point of the movie. Issues of homophobia, racism, misogyny and countless other prejudices are touched with a sharp, cynical twang. Emotional moments are slapped in the face by cutting jokes, never letting the audience settle in.A script is only as good as the people who recite it, though, and there's a reason why Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for their performances. Sure, everyone is else as just as good, but the two leads are magnetic. Nicholson does a perfect job of playing the grumpy Melvin Udall, and he never really stops being grumpy; and this works excellently in response to Helen Hunt's exhausted but ever-optimistic Carol Connelly. The chemistry between the two is top-notch.You could argue that, perhaps, that the film goes on too long. It's over two hours long, when ninety minutes would have been absolutely fine. That extra time allows the film-makers to populate the film with other slightly bizarre characters, all adding to the general acerbic aura of the film. However, it's two hours of excellent acting, breathing beautiful life into some excellently written dialogue. Definitely worth a watch.",9,1,1,20 August 2013
The Hunger Games," A very good movie, really
","To protect her younger sister, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take part in The Hunger Games. This is a televised battle where twenty-four teenagers – two from each of the districts of Panem – are forced to fight each other to the death. Blessed with incredible archery skills, Katniss uses all her resources and luck to try and make it to the end.When I first heard about this movie getting made, I rolled my eyes. It just seemed like Hollywood was looking to piggyback on the success of the Twilight saga by bringing yet another teen novel franchise to the big screen. And let's face it, they were piggybacking. But, and this is a big but, 'The Hunger Games' defied all my expectations.I'll be honest, if this film was just okay, I'd have been pleasantly surprised. The fact that it's actually brilliant is a slap in the face. You have a very strong plot and story – while I don't think the film properly explains the reason behind why this barbaric event takes place, it's a very interesting concept. There are also the obvious connections to 'Battle Royale', but 'Battle Royale' paid more attention to the blood and the violence. 'The Hunger Games' pays much more attention to character development and the emotional drama.That's not to say the violence wasn't good. In fact, the violence was extremely well-directed. That very first action sequence when the Games start is a visceral pleasure, enhanced by shaky camera effects and a lack of music. Director Gary Ross is equally adept at handling these violent scenes as he is at getting us to engage with the characters on screen.Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favourite actors right now, and she proves why in this film. Katniss Everdeen is very similar to the character Lawrence plays in 'Winter's Bone' (for which she was nominated for an Oscar): a young girl who is mature beyond her years, with an entire family dependent on her. Katniss cannot afford to show emotion or weakness; all she can do is carry on living, and carry on supporting her family. It makes her cold and distant, but it also makes her a survivor. Lawrence exudes all of these things perfectly. While the outcome of the movie is obviously very predictable, it's the journey she goes on that appeals. She's surrounded by a cast of great actors (Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson stand out), but this is all about Lawrence.Like most films, 'The Hunger Games' is probably far too long. Half an hour could have been shaved off and it would have been perfect. But it is on the longer side, and that's a small price to pay, I suppose. But what makes it more grating is that, despite the long running time, a lot of stuff isn't explained enough. It makes me want to read the books (which is good, I guess), but the film should not unwittingly leave you with questions.'The Hunger Games' is a brilliant film, and I am genuinely interested in seeing the sequel, and where the character of Katniss Everdeen goes next.",8,0,3,4 September 2013
Argo," Another brilliant Ben Affleck effort
","Cinema these days is dominated by remakes and reboots and sequels and adaptations; there are rare exceptions, sure, but film studios and filmmakers seem too scared to attempt something original. Everything is based on something. There's always a source material. So it's no longer about how original a movie is, but how original that source material is. Which brings us nicely onto Argo, which is inspired by one of the most original source materials out there.It's more or less a case of truth being stranger than fiction with Argo. Six American diplomats living in Iran have to go into hiding during the 1980 Iranian Revolution. The CIA concocts a plan to bring them back, by making them pose as the film crew for a fake science fiction movie.It's hard to believe that all of this actually happened – that the American and Canadian governments were able to fool the Iranians to such a farcical extent is fascinating, and so it's no surprise that director Ben Affleck wanted to tackle it. He's also a producer on the film along with George Clooney, which tells you how much faith there is in the subject matter. This is a film about the strength of the human spirit, and the lengths that people will go to protect their own, a theme that seems to run through all of Affleck's writing and directorial efforts.Another staple of Affleck's films is his knack at picking a stellar cast; and the cast for Argo is fantastic. Bryan Cranston. John Goodman. Alan Arkin. Scoot McNairy. Victor Garber. Kyle Chandler. Chris Messina. And that's not even the full list of excellent supporting cast. So many brilliant actors acting brilliantly. It's a treat to watch. Each of the lead actors gets a moment to shine, whether it's Arkin and Goodman trading barbs, Scoot McNairy's airport performance, or Cranston's running around. But just like in The Town and, arguably, Good Will Hunting, Affleck is the one giving the best performance of the movie. He is a quiet presence, letting the personalities around him strut their stuff while he holds it all together. The comparison to Clint Eastwood is blatant: an actor-director capable of bringing the best out of himself.The film has flaws. There are inconsistencies, and a few logic slip-ups, especially in the climax of the movie. Sure, they help amp up the drama, but jars the movie slightly. Too many characters means a slight confusion about who and where everyone is. And I wish I had more emotional investment in the six hostages, as I don't care too much about their survival as I do about the whole plan itself.But I'm nitpicking, because I think criticisms are needed. Whatever faults there are in this film, they're overshadowed by so much good. Conception and execution of this story are top-notch. Ben Affleck proves once again that he is fast becoming one of the best actor-directors out there. Yes, this is not an entirely original film but, if you're gonna adapt something, make sure it's done properly. Argo is, fortunately; a must-see.",9,5,8,9 November 2012
Finding Nemo," Another brilliant Pixar production
","When his only child Nemo (Alexander Gould) is captured by divers in the Great Barrier Reef, his extremely shy and anxiety-ridden father (Marlin) sets out on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, he meets many friends and foes, including Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with a short-term memory.After 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' is probably the Pixar movie everyone likes to talk about. It took me ten years to watch it, but it was well worth the wait. 'Finding Nemo' is a very good film. What makes the movie so good is what has made so many other Pixar movies so good – the emotion. Yes, visually, it's brilliant (and we'll get on to that), but that Pixar crowd has this amazing ability to tell great stories.In what has become a staple of the company, this film centres on the bond between two characters – in this case, father and son. The opening sequence is heartbreaking, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The strength of that first scene is such that we invest in the relationship Marlin and Nemo have. We believe in Marlin's fear and Nemo's rebellion. I'd argue that Pixar were able to capture that emotion with much more depth in 'Up', but this was perfectly fine for a first attempt.More than the two leads, the show is stolen by the character of Dory. I've never seen Ellen DeGeneres act but she's extremely good with the voice. The role was supposedly written for her, and she makes the most of that opportunity. Laugh-out-loud funny at times, Dory is a delight to watch, and it's no surprise that she's the focal point of the upcoming sequel.As with all Disney/Pixar animations, there has to be humour, and there is a lot of humour. My only problem was that, for the sake of humour, the story does get sidetracked somewhat. Marlin's desperate search for Nemo gets put on the backburner as he's shooting the breeze with turtles, or taking part in vegetarian shark meetings. Okay, so it's for kids, so maybe I shouldn't look too deeply into it, but it did irk me.Of the Pixar movies I've seen, this isn't at the top. All three 'Toy Story' films probably trump it, and 'Up' is possibly just that bit more funnier; but, with such a strong filmography, 'Finding Nemo' coming up fifth (maybe sixth behind 'Wall-E') is not a disservice at all. Great for kids and adults, it's highly recommended.",9,1,2,23 September 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," A very fun entertainer
","Those of you old enough might remember the Tintin show that, if I'm correct, used to come on Channel 4 early in the mornings. It was great, really fun to watch. So I had a keen interest in the movie when it was announced, especially after knowing that it was being directed by one Steven Spielberg.The Secret Of The Unicorn is about Tintin (Jamie Bell), the brave young journalist always on the lookout for a story. Purchasing a model of a ship propels him into an epic adventure across the world, assisted by the drunk Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), and thwarted by the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig).Since it released in the cinema, I've seen this movie about four times, and I always enjoy it. Mostly because it has all that charm you expect from a Spielberg charm, but with the added bonus of it being a motion capture animation. The digital effects are absolutely sublime, and need to be seen in HD to be properly appreciated. The highlight has to be the incredible chase sequence involving Snowy the dog and an eagle, with blatant comparisons to Indiana Jones and The Goonies apparent. On the other hand, there are sequences in the movie which are perhaps a bit too far-fetched. Yes, it's an animated film, but we're trained to think of this as 'real life'.Performance-wise, it's a good affair. I think Andy Serkis is the star of the show; Haddock is a great character, and he does it justice. It's fun to see Daniel Craig do something a bit sillier than usual, and Jamie Bell is his usual solid self. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are comic relief, somewhat, but their talents are wasted, I think.Overall, I give this a thumbs-up. Whether you're a fan of the original books, or the TV show like me, you'll enjoy this cinematic version. With a sequel already earmarked (especially considering the end of this movie), this could turn into a very successful franchise. Good stuff.",7,2,2,21 November 2012
The Town," A great crime thriller
","Ben Affleck is probably most remembered for things like Daredevil (bad) or Gigli (atrocious), so you'll probably be forgiven if you didn't really want to go and see this movie. You'd be forgiven, but you would be asked to reconsider. Because 'The Town' is one of the best crime thrillers to come around in a helluva long time.Affleck writes, directs and stars in this story about Doug, a bank robber struggling between the demons of his criminal past, and a hopeful new life in the form of love - and former heist victim - Claire (Rebecca Hall).There are lots of action sequences in this movie. You've got the bank robberies and the car chases and the gunfights. All the good stuff you'd expect from a crime drama. But 'The Town' is so much more than that. It is a study of the hopeless, pigeon-holed lives of working class criminals, having nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, and what happens to these people when the chance for redemption rears its head. And at the heart of it all is a spectacular performance from Ben Affleck himself.It's funny, because the last great Affleck performance I remember is 'Good Will Hunting'; and, lo and behold, he wrote that too. Affleck is seemingly at his best when he is control, and he calls all the shots here. The result is fantastic. He's helped, too, by some equally fantastic performances from Rebecca Hall and Jeremy Renner, and what could be a career-defining role for Blake Lively.What probably lets the film down is its length. At two-and-a-half hours, it requires a lot of patience and attention, but it's worth it in the end. Maybe there could have been half an hour shaved off, but I then also can't recall any sequences that felt dispensable. Everything was there for a reason, meticulously written and wonderfully shot.I remember reading somewhere that Ben Affleck was starting to become the Clint Eastwood of this generation. I scoffed at it. But watching this movie, and knowing what Affleck had done with 'Good Will Hunting', my opinion has begun to change. If writing and directing will make Affleck churn out films like 'The Town', then let the man write and direct at his leisure. A must-watch.",8,2,3,16 October 2012
Taxi Driver," A masterclass in filmmaking and acting
","Unhinged and unable to sleep, Vietnam War veteran Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) takes up a job as night-time New York City cab driver. Amongst the filth and depravity of the night-time New York streets, Travis comes across a twelve-year old prostitute called Iris (Jodie Foster). Feeling like it is his duty to protect his preadolescent, Travis begins to succumb to a previously-suppressed urge for violence within him.'Taxi Driver' easily ranks amongst the greatest films ever made, and is arguably also Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro's best film (though there are other valid contenders too). What makes the film so good is that it's the perfect snapshot of the time – late seventies, an America that is still reeling from the horrors of Vietnam, with that disillusionment and depravity so beautifully portrayed. But, despite the film being so rooted in time, it manages to remain relevant today almost 40 years later. This could be watched in 2013, and still resonate with the viewer as much as it would have done in the seventies.Obviously, the main draw of the movie is Mr DeNiro. And, yes, he is incredible. From the very first shot, he is sublime. The film has often been described as a horror movie and, if you go with that line of thinking, then DeNiro is easily the monster. His cheeky grins and boyish looks are hiding a sinister side – as the film goes on, and the façade slips, Bickle becomes frightening. It's amazing to see DeNiro make that transformation.In the deserved praise heaped on DeNiro, I think the power of Jodie Foster's performance is somewhat underrated. At only twelve years, having to play the role she does, Foster is amazing. Not many kids that age would play a prostitute, but she does it, and does it brilliantly. I've never been a massive fan of Foster's work, but she certainly does a stellar job in this movie.Another great aspect of the movie is the score. Again, the horror movie theory is backed up by the downright frightening theme music. More than an actual tune, it is almost a warning drone. Rising brass instruments, loud and brash, it is haunting and creates the perfect ambiance for the film.I could go on and on about all the other good things about the movie (Cybill Shepherd, Scorsese's cameo, the aesthetic violence, the visceral nature of the film, the script), but I'd be here forever. If you haven't seen it already, shame on you. See it now. It's an education in cinema.",10,1,2,10 October 2013
Life of Pi," A beautiful film, and a visual tour-de-force
","A young writer travels to Canada to meet Pi (Irrfan Khan), an Indian man with an incredible story to tell. It is the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma), who gets stranded in the Pacific Ocean with only a fearsome Bengal tiger to keep him company. The two castaways form a strange bond as they try to stay alive and get help.That's the story of Life Of Pi, the novel written by Yann Martel back in 2001. For nearly ten years the international bestseller was deemed unfilmable, despite numerous attempts. It was only when Ang Lee took control that the movie became a reality, and it has finally hit the big screen.The result of Ang Lee's attempts is an epic piece of cinema. The film is absolutely brilliant, with just the right amount of humour, emotion and action to satisfy everyone. I've not read the book yet (I will, for sure), but I get the feeling that justice was done here in regards to the adaptation. Characters are properly fleshed out, major and minor, and relationships are developed well enough to matter as the film goes on. If anything could have been explored better, it would be the relationship between Pi and his mother (Tabu). The influence she has on his life seems understated, and not in a good way.Life Of Pi is very much a work of fiction; at no point are we led to believe that it is based on reality, and this works massively in the filmmakers' favour. Unlike Zemeckis' Castaway, which is rooted in the reality of it all, Lee opts to focus more on the fantastical and beautiful. There is no real sense of time, and we aren't always told how certain things happen. They just do, and the story moves along.There are two things that stand out about this movie, and one thing that lets it down sorely. The good first. Suraj Sharma, as Pi, is excellent. Considering he has no acting experience, he is a revelation. And secondly, the movie is visually stunning. Absolutely beautiful from first frame to last. It's a visceral treat.Now the bad. I watched the film in 3D, and thought many times: why is this in 3D? I counted literally two moments where the 3D worked well. Other than that, it was useless. If the money spent on 3D was spent on shooting it in IMAX, Life Of Pi could have been even better. Instead, it was a bit darker than it needed to be, and everyone sits in a cinema looking like Stevie Wonder for no reason.The good heavily outweighs the bad, though, and I highly recommend the movie. Like with Avatar, the movie should be seen for the visuals alone. Unlike Avatar though, this is actually a good film. You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll be engrossed with them, and you'll feel a genuine sense of rejoice as everything unravels. I can't tell you if the movie is better or worse than the book. I can tell you that that doesn't matter here: the movie is excellent all on it's own.",9,4,8,11 December 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," A solid addition to the Marvel film collection
","Maybe it was coincidental, but it's quite funny that the last Avenger to grace the big screen before the epic group project was the First Avenger. The film tells the story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a young man who agrees to take part in a top secret military experiment after being declared unfit for military service. The result? Rogers become Captain America, a super-soldier of sorts dedicated to fighting for America.This is a good film but, in some ways, what happens for 95% of the movie is irrelevant. A little harsh, yeah, but all I really wanted to know was how Captain America moves from the 1940s to the present day. And we don't really find that out until the very end. Until then, Captain America is busy fighting Nazis, especially the equally superpowered Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). Evans gets ample support from the likes of Tommy Lee Jones, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell. That's all well and good, but everything is just a very long interlude for that interesting final five minutes.Still, it's an enjoyable enough movie that does a solid job of telling the Captain America story. I would happily watch a sequel, which is in the works.",6,0,1,19 September 2012
Rush," Another good Ron Howard movie
","When you think Ron Howard, you think Richie, obviously; and then you think blockbusters. He's made a quite a few of them. Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, Cocoon; and those are just the films that I like. Pretty much all of his films are commercial and/or critical successes, and every new film is met with a lot of hype and fanfare. We can now add Rush to that list of blockbusters.For those that don't know, Rush is the true story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Formula 1 drivers in the 1970s. The two men were at the top of their game, which led to a very personal and merciless rivalry both on and off the track.Rush follows the same pattern that all of Ron Howard's films seem to, which, considering his track record, is probably a good thing. The main similarity is the very strong story, and Rush has a fantastic one. The rivalry between Lauda and Hunt was a vicious one, with incidents that arguably could only have been the stuff of fiction. The fact that it's all true is incredible, and you don't need to be a racing fan to appreciate it. Another similarity. Like with Apollo 13 and Frost/Nixon, Howard is able to take a subject with a niche interest and make it appeal to the masses.In Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, we are also witness to two very good performances. If you've seen Inglorious Basterds, then you probably already know that Bruhl is a very good actor; and here, he's excellent as the cold, boring Lauda. The real star, though, is Hemsworth. After a filmography that includes superhero and horror movies, this might be seen his breakthrough as a serious actor. It was very impressive. The supporting cast were decent enough, but nobody else really stands out beyond the top two. What was nice to see is Green Wing alumni Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt make appearances. But, at the end of the day, you're watching the movie for the two leads, and they're very good.Here's the problem, though. As good as the story is, and as good as the actors and the performances are, Rush falls down where so many of his films have done. The script. They're not awful, don't get me wrong – his films wouldn't be successful if the scripts were horrendous. The problem with the scripts are that they're overly sentimental and, at times, very cheesy. It really gets a little hard to watch when the stuff being said is so full of exposition.However, if you're happy to forgive the filmmakers for that (and most audiences seem to), then you're still really going to enjoy this movie. Despite the subject matter, it manages to balance a good amount of humour and drama. Add in some excellent performances, and you've got a fun film to watch.This will never go down as one of Ron Howard's best movies, and he won't win any awards for it probably, but it's a great effort. Give it a look.",7,5,12,9 September 2013
Watchmen," A long film, but a faithful and excellent one
","In an alternative reality, America in 1985 is home to a group of former superheroes who have now moved on. But when one of their members is killed in suspicious circumstances, the group is drawn back together; what they uncover could change the course of history as they know it.For those how haven't read it, 'Watchmen' is a fantastic graphic novel, the first I ever read. From the excellent concept and story, to the beautiful artistry, the novel ranks rightfully as one of the best ever written. The film had a lot to live up to, and I came in with slight reservations. So rather than chop and change it too much, director Zack Snyder smartly does his best to stay true to the text. Now, this works both to his advantage and to his detriment.The bad first, and it is one major criticism: 'Watchmen' is far too long. There are a few versions out there, and the one I watched clocked in at about two hours and forty minutes. Yes, it's engaging, and so much of the novel is retained in the book, but it requires a great deal of investment. And because the film is so closely adapted from the text, there are long periods where there is essentially a lull. For me, watching a near-three hour film, those lulls were a bit difficult to get through.However, if you're able to get through the sheer length of the movie, what you're treated to is an extremely faithful and visceral adaptation. The film is violent and unflinching, with some fantastic casting choices. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) and Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) are the standout performers – the latter steals every scene he is in. In particular, Rorschach's scenes in the prison are great to watch, and he is exactly as I imagined he would be in the comic.'Watchmen' also benefits from a very good soundtrack. The use of Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are A'Changing' in the introductory sequence is the one that everyone raves about, and it is great (it's the perfect accompaniment as the film's place, time and atmosphere is established); however, there are also great songs from the likes of Simon & Garfunkel and Leonard Cohen littered in there, all adding to the spectacle. Snyder also uses the same colour and light tricks he did in '300', giving the visual quality a nice little sheen.You don't really need to have read the graphic novel to enjoy the film, but I'd argue that knowing the source text will probably make you appreciate just how good the film is. You're going to see some excellent performances, and the story is thoroughly engaging; but as good as it is, it should not need to be close to three hours long.",8,0,2,30 October 2013
Hugo," Another visual treat from the maestro
","Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the walls of a train station, in 1930s Paris. He becomes embroiled in a mystery involving his dead father, an automaton, and the enigmatic Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley).I'm not a big fan of 3D – in fact, I hate it. I'm yet to see a movie that does the format justice but, admittedly, Hugo comes pretty bloody close. What sets 'Hugo' apart from other 3D movies, and one of the reasons I enjoyed it, is that it's a 3D movie about 3D movies. It therefore allows the filmmakers artistic license, and makes the format more acceptable.But that's what happens when Martin Scorsese makes a film – the man is a certified genius, who knows how to get the best out of what he's working with. We all know he can do it with the actors, we know he can do it with genres, now he does it with 3D. And the truth is that, as good as everything else about this movie is (and there's a lot of good), the best thing about this film is the visuals. From start to finish, 'Hugo' looks spectacular. The opening scene, as we see the camera 'zoom' through Paris to the intricacies of the train station is breathtaking, and it retains that high standard throughout.It's also helped by the fact that the cast is full of incredible actors. From the young leads to the elder statesmen, everyone chips in with stellar performances. Asa Butterfield is a great choice for the lead actor, and Chloe Moretz does a very decent job with her English accent. That girl is gonna be a huge star when she's older, and will thoroughly deserve it. Not much needs to be said about Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee and Ray Winstone and Helen McCrory, and all the other veterans. They're good, we know. Sacha Cohen is a revelation, though. He is fantastic as the Station Inspector.'Hugo' deserved all the awards that it won – it's a fantastic film and I loved watching it. Scorsese doesn't make many bad films and, with this, he proves that he can make films for children too. And that 3D is actually bearable.",9,3,5,30 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," A fantastic performance nestled inside an average movie
","After getting released from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and dedicates his life to patching things up with his ex-wife. Things start to get a bit more complicated when he meets the gorgeous Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has mental health problems of her own, and the two strike up an odd friendship.The best thing about 'Silver Linings Playbook' is that you have some very good actors doing some very good acting. The film itself is alright, I wouldn't say it's great. It's based on a novel, and it's easy to see how a lot of the scenarios would play out better in prose; the writing, too, isn't always strong. Yes, it does have its moments, but I get the feeling that I'd probably have enjoyed it more as a novel.But let's get back to the acting. It is the performances that make 'Silver Lining Playbook' better than it probably should be. Top of the heap is Jennifer Lawrence, who is just incredible. It's the film she won the Oscar for, and deservedly so. She's funny, tragic and pitiful all at the same time. Her comic delivery, her facial expressions, her ability to pull off the crazy mood swings as seamlessly as she does. This is the kind of performance you'd expect from a seasoned actor, not from someone barely in her twenties. Bradley Cooper is great too, and he probably would have gotten all the accolades had it not been for his co-star.What stopped the film from being a great one was the portrayal of mental health. For the first half of the film, I was actually very impressed. The mental health issues are treated with sincerity, albeit with a strong tinge of humour. But as the film goes on, it starts to get a bit farcical and loses that sincerity. A shame, really. Had it been shown with greater care, I think 'Silver Linings Playbook' could have staked a claim for being one of the films of the year. Instead, the film will be remembered for allowing Jennifer Lawrence to give the best performance of her career to date, and not much else.",7,0,1,10 September 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher Teaches An Old Dog New Tricks!
","'Dragon Tattoo' hit the cinemas on Boxing Day, only two years after the original Swedish version arrived, a massive hit in its own right. Both films are based on the bestselling book, written by Stieg Larsson as part of his 'Millennium' trilogy. You'd have to question why Hollywood would remake a movie so soon after the original, but that tells you a lot about the state of Hollywood right now.Pros and cons aside, though, this is a fun movie. That needs to be established. I was engaged, I didn't get bored, I was even leaning forward at points because I was so immersed in it. When you have a team of people that includes David Fincher, Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer, that's the least you should expect, and it succeeds on that level.The story quickly - disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by the retired and stupidly wealthy Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find out which member of the Vanger family killed his granddaughter fifty years ago. Blomqvist agrees, and quickly starts his investigation. He ends up finding out about Lisbeth Salander (Mara), a girl with incredible hacking skills and a very distinctive tattoo. She helps him with the investigation, and the rest of the film is them trying to solve the case.But, obviously, no good film is ever as simple as that. There are lots of smaller sub-plots and character histories, adding more layers to the story, and pushing it beyond the typical whodunnit. While it's good those layers are there – and I'm sure the books delve much deeper – the restricted running time means that those subplots aren't fully explored. I won't go into spoiler territory, but we have to believe characters are able to achieve things without consequence, so the movie doesn't slow down. The exact same problems are there in the original Swedish version; I really wish Fincher had tried to remove those problems, but he didn't. Another issue with the Swedish version was the controversy over the graphic sexual violence in the movie. There's graphic sexual violence in this version too, and it's not for the squeamish. But, frankly, it's justified. Those scenes do as much a good job of building character and tone as any in the movie.But enough of where Fincher falters, let's talk about where he excels. A quick IMDb search showed me that I've seen almost every Fincher film, and they're all great. The guy knows how to make a film. What he does best of all is bring out outstanding performances from actors who don't really seem suited to their role. Brad Pitt in Fight Club; Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network; and now, Rooney Mara. Mara is stunningly good as Lisbeth, just fantastic. Vulnerable, unhinged, sexy, detached, steely, feminine – she goes through a whole gambit of emotions without really ever saying much. It's all in the eyes. Her partner in crime is Daniel Craig; granted, this is a role we've seen Craig do many times, but that's not a shot. He does it well. But what really griped me was the fact that everybody spoke in Swedish accents, except Craig. Why? It made no sense. You forget about it eventually, but it's still puzzling.I'm not gonna go on and on about every single cast member, because it'd be a waste of your time. But if you know the people on this list: Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Steven Berkoff, Robin Wrightthen you know you're in for some great performances.The other bits of the film – the music, the cinematography, the editing – are typically brilliant. The music's all techno-y, the cinematography is all Swedish-y, and the editing is all frenetic-y. And you've got a cover of Led Zep right at the beginning, which is always welcome, despite the fact that the opening montage is more Bond-like than anything else. It seems out of place from the rest of the film, but good visually nonetheless.There are things to fault, it's not perfect film. But it's still a brilliant one. For Mara's performance alone, it's worth watching. Inevitably, people will compare her to the original Girl, Noomi Rapace, but Mara makes the character her own. Everyone else is just as great, and you're left with a movie that leaves you wanting more. And, conveniently, we won't be far away from more.Watch it.",8,4,10,3 January 2012
The Machinist," Frail Bale enhances a somewhat average movie
","Having not slept for over a year, industrial worker Trevor Reznik begins to interact with people and see things that are out of the ordinary. While trying to prove that the mysterious Ivan is real, he begins to question his own sanity. What is real, and what is a figment of his sleep-deprived imagination starts to become unclear.'The Machinist' has become famous for being THAT Christian Bale film where he's dangerously thin. And, guys, Christian Bale is dangerously thin in this film; scarily so. That's literally the only reason I had for wanting to see the movie, as I had no idea what the film was about, or what it's critical and commercial standing was.And yes, Bale's performance is immense. As the insomniac Trevor Reznik, he is a livewire on screen, stealing every scene he's in. You forget quite quickly that it's a Hollywood superstar, and get lost in the character. Reznik is a man in constant suffering – the lack of sleep, the breakdown of his sanity, his helplessness, his lack of trust – and Bale every emotion with class. His very thin physique adds to the aura of the character, and the star deserves huge kudos for the dedication.But truth be told, it's a very good performance in only a decent movie. While I was fully engaged by the Trevor Reznik character, and thoroughly enjoyed seeing Bale's performance, I didn't have as much enthusiasm for the rest of the film. None of the other characters (except maybe Jennifer Jason Leigh's character Stevie) really resonated, with the chief antagonist Ivan (John Sharian) more annoying than anything else.At the heart of it, the film is a mystery thriller full of twists and turns. Again, just like the characters themselves, I was never really blown away by the changes in the narrative. Because I didn't engage with the characters, I didn't engage with the action either. The ending was also extremely anticlimactic, leaving me quite unsatisfied.I think 'The Machinist' is a movie which gets by on the appeal of Christian Bale's acting performance, and he is perhaps strong enough to make the film watchable. The fact he lived on just a can of tuna and an apple for so long is ridiculous, and it's worth seeing the movie just to experience the result of that dedication. But don't be fooled that this is an amazing film. The comparisons to 'Memento' and 'Shutter Island' are obvious, but 'Memento' this is not. It's a decent film, anchored by an excellent lead performance, that's all.",6,1,2,18 November 2013
Bad Teacher," Very uninspired and boring movie
","You can see why Cameron Diaz would choose a film, and a role, like the one she plays in 'Bad Teacher'. You'd think she was expecting the kind of reception Billy Bob Thornton got from 'Bad Santa'; or Charlize Theron in 'Young Adult'. Crass and unlikeable character. One-liners aplenty. And general comedy goodness.A shame, then, that 'Bad Teacher' isn't general comedy goodness. It's actually really boring. To sum up, money-hungry Elizabeth (Diaz) wants a boob job to impressive new substitute teacher Scott (a really funny Justin Timberlake). Cue attempts to blackmail, embezzle and other unoriginal things to get the money. Inevitably, the tart gets a heart.And it's all very uninteresting, really. Diaz puts her all into the role. I think she's great in it. Similarly, there are good turns from Timberlake, Jason Segel and a really excellent Lucy Punch. But the problem is that they are good actors in an uninspired and bad film. The writing is mainly boring; the story is constantly boring; and you're left at the end feeling, well, bored. I did anyway.It's a disappointing film, because a lot of talent is being sorely wasted. With a better script, this could have rivalled the near-perfect 'Bad Santa'. As it stands, this rivals the likes of 'Four Christmasses'. And that's a bad thing, for the record.",4,3,7,9 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The best Peter Parker, but not the best Spider-Man
","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an extremely intelligent but awkward teenager, wants to find out why his parents disappeared when he was young. His search leads him to scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans); but it also leads him to getting bitten by a mutant spider, turning him into the Spiderman.I was never a big fan of the Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire incarnation of Spider-Man, mainly because I'm not really a big fan of Maguire. So I was actually quite interested in this reboot, because I am a very big fan of Andrew Garfield, and I was interested to see what he could do.What he did, in the end, was give what I think is the best portrayal of Peter Parker to date. His speech patterns, his physicality, his presence on screen; everything about Garfield's performance was exactly how I imagined Peter Parker to be. And, coincidentally, Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was also near-perfect. It helps that the two are a couple in real life, bringing their off-screen chemistry to their on-screen romance. It's very well done.And yet, despite two fantastic lead performances, this wasn't a very good movie. It was just okay. I found myself being bored for large parts of the movie, which you can't say very often for most Marvel movies. Part of the problem is that the villains don't hold up their end of the deal. Rhys Ifans is a very good actor, but I never felt a threat from The Lizard, as though this was a terrible danger for Spider-Man. Sure, the visuals are good, but that's not really enough. It also seemed like parts of the story had either been cut or shortened, certain sequences feeling rushed and undeveloped.Like all comic-book movies, there are the nods to the past, and that is always fun. And you have cameos from stalwarts like Martin Sheen, Sally Field and even Stan Lee himself, but it doesn't help the overall enjoyment of the movie. However, and maybe this is because of my appreciation for Garfield and Stone, but I'm willing to give them another chance. There is a sequel on its way, and I'm looking forward to it. I wouldn't say the movie was awful, because it was far from it. I just think it was somewhat below my expectations, and they now have one more chance to win me round.",6,1,4,23 August 2013
Foxcatcher," Two excellent performances highlight a great film
","Foxcatcher is your typical Oscar contender. It's based on an extraordinary true story. It has a bunch of very accomplished actors, many of whom are performing at the top of their game. It has that central performance which anchors the movie. And, crucially, it's quite fun to watch. Put it next to the other contenders that have just been announced, and this Bennett Miller film fits in very nicely.The story is definitely extraordinary, and hard to believe that it happened less than thirty years ago. Mark and David Schultz, who both won gold medals in wrestling at the 1984 Olympics, were recruited by reclusive millionaire John DuPont to train the next generation of Olympic wrestlers at his purpose-built training centre. Known as Team Foxcatcher, it was an unlikely alliance with even unlikelier circumstances.You don't need me to tell you how all of this ended – a quick Google search will do a much better job of that – but I can tell you that a very solid job was done of bringing it to the screen. Bennett Miller is a director with proved success in biopics – Capote and Moneyball are both brilliant – and he continues in that vein with this. He's very good at making sure he doesn't take too many creative liberties, letting the truth of the story take precedence.But when you look back on Miller's past successes, what he does best is get excellent performances from the unlikeliest of actors and, with Foxcatcher, he gives that privilege to Steve Carell. Arguably one of the best comedy actors of the modern era, Carell was a massive gamble for this role, but he is fantastic. The prosthetic nose and hairpiece already help to strip away any preconceptions, but it is a performance so far removed from his previous work that you can't help but be impressed. DuPont was the richest man in America at the time, but he was also a loner. Living in the shadow of his mother (a small but significant and vicious cameo from Vanessa Redgrave), he saw Team Foxcatcher as his way of getting acceptance. The way he goes about trying to achieve that is funny (in a twisted way), but Carell plays it straight. There's no deliberate attempt to amuse, and neither does it happen accidentally. Every time he appears on screen, Carell makes you uncomfortable, especially as his power increases.The other two points of this triangle casting are a mixed bag. On the one hand, we have Mark Ruffalo, who is the MVP. While Carell is the one getting all the media attention, it's Ruffalo who quietly steals the show with a very understated and emotional performance. He is the moral compass of the movie and, like so many great performers before him, he manages to express deep, complex emotions just by shrugging his shoulders or laughing nervously. He is definitely up there as one of the best character actors of this generation, and a joy to watch. Channing Tatum, I'm not as sure of. He is a good actor, don't get me wrong, and he isn't bad in this. In fact, he surprised me with the maturity of the performance. But, the truth is, he's a good actor but not a great one; and as Mark Schultz, who the film is following most, it needed somebody who could match Carell and Ruffalo. And he couldn't. I sat there and kept wondering how different the film would have been if it was Tom Hardy up there. Similar builds, similar intensity, but Hardy is far above Tatum when it comes to acting chops. But we got Tatum, and he holds his own, so fair enough.What people do need to know is that Foxcatcher isn't a film about wrestling; there is, of course, some wrestling in it, but it's there as a narrative device. In fact, one of the best scenes of the film is a wrestling 'match' between the Schultz brothers. It's a five-minute scene where the older brother (Ruffalo) is training the younger one (Tatum), but there is clearly some tension. There are barely more than four or five words spoken, but we pretty much learn everything we need to know about the sibling relationship in that five minutes. Tremendous. At its core, Foxcatcher is about two things. The want and need for power; and the consequences of living in someone else's shadow. Foxcatcher has rightfully got some great press, primarily because of Steve Carell's performance, but I don't think it's quite there as an Oscar-winning movie. Of the three leads, Ruffalo is the one most deserving of an award (and he's nominated for Best Supporting Actor), but there are other actors more deserving. Still, this is a really engaging, dramatic thriller which does justice to an extraordinary true story.",8,3,9,17 January 2015
Insidious," Great first half, absurd second half
","A family is seemingly haunted by spirits from another dimension, which leads to their young son going into a coma. The longer the boy remains comatose, the worse the haunting gets. A medium is brought to solve the issue, who discovers that the boy's spirit is trapped in another dimension known as The Further.I haven't watched very many horror movies at the cinema; mainly because there aren't many top quality horrors out there now. But the pull of a double-bill, and the fact that this is made by the creator of the Saw franchise, dragged me here for this. And for about half of 'Insidious', I was pleased I made the decision to go.The first half of the movie is terrific. The characters and the haunted house is all set-up nicely. You have accomplished actors in Rose Byrne (as Renai) and Patrick Wilson (as Josh) at the helm, and pretty good child actors. Like all good horror movies, the chill factor is amped up. Creaking staircases, dark doorways, scary apparitions – it's all here, and it's all very good. I'll be honest, I was a little scared. There's something quite unnerving about watching a horror movie in a dark cinema, it certainly adds to the ambiance.The second half, though, is ridiculous. As we start to understand what is going on, and what these apparitions are, the film starts to descend into absurdity. The 'monsters' aren't really that terrifying once we see them properly, and the story becomes far too mental for my liking. The best bit about the second half is the introduction of medium Elise (Lin Shaye), who is a breath of fresh air. Similarly, the characters Specs (Leigh Whannell, also the writer) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) bring some much-needed comedy to the proceedings. These three characters keep the film watchable, but doesn't stop it getting ridiculous.'Insidious' is definitely a game of two halves – the setup is nice, the payoff not so much. However, there aren't that many great American horror movies out there. So if we're using its peers as a comparison, then the film is definitely one of the stronger offerings out there. If you're able to tolerate the absurdity of the second half, then I think you'd enjoy the terror of the first.",6,0,0,13 September 2013
The Theory of Everything," An excellent film with an astonishingly good transformative lead performance
","There was one little moment in 'The Theory Of Everything' that I really didn't like – while on stage in his wheelchair, Stephen Hawkins imagines himself standing up, picking up a pencil off the floor and placing it on a table. It's an odd fantasy sequence in a film that does so much to ground itself in the utmost reality, and I'm taken out of the moment. But why do I start this review straight off with a criticism? Because I figured I should probably note ONE criticism, considering that these thirty uncharacteristic seconds are preceded by two hours of exceptional cinema.For those who don't know, 'The Theory Of Everything' is the biopic of legendary physicist Stephen Hawking. Told chronologically starting with his time at Cambridge University, the film recounts both the young man's rise to bona fide genius and the physical deterioration caused by Motor Neurone Disease. At the centre of it all is his wife Jane (who's memoir the film is adapted from), the rock that meant Hawking never stopped fulfilling his potential. As much as the film is about Stephen and his extraordinary life, it is just as much about her extraordinary resolve. And, above all, it's about the strength of their love (which is, yes, extraordinary).I'll admit, I had my doubts about the casting of this film. Both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are undoubtedly very talented, but I wasn't sure they could pull off such complex characters. Man, was I wrong! The two actors are astonishingly good, and have a fantastic chemistry on screen. Even their scenes as young lovers, before the tough stuff, is great. We really believe that they were made for each other, despite the obvious faith and science conflict, and it's beautiful to watch. But it's when that tough stuff starts, when Hawking begins to break down physically, that the chemistry is electric.As Jane, Felicity Jones proves a revelation. Her transformation from sweet young girl to steely-souled wife is brilliant, as she battles to keep herself together. Even when she finally breaks, we don't hate her – quite the opposite, in fact. Screenwriter Anthony McCarten makes sure to never paint her as a bad person – instead, she comes across as a woman who has reached the end of her tether, justifying her eventual decisions. Jones, to her credit, expresses that brilliantly. It's what she doesn't say that is most striking about her performance, with those tired eyes and awkward silences.But let's cut to the chase; the real star of this movie is Eddie Redmayne. I should probably explain why I didn't like those thirty second at the end of the movie. Such is the magnificence of Redmayne's transformation that I forget it's him. At no point does it feel like I'm watching an actor play a role – this is Stephen Hawking – until he picks up the pencil and looks like Redmayne again. There is an everyman quality about Redmayne which makes him perfect for the character – yes, Hawking was a genius, but it never corrupted him. He was humble, charming, funny, innocent in his own way, and Redmayne captures that with his goofy grins and cheeky wry smiles. Even when he is at the point that he can't talk or move his body, when almost everything has shut down, he never stops trying. There is a wonderful scene where he meets his new nurse (Maxine Peake in a small but excellent cameo), which is both laugh-out-loud funny and tragic at the same time. Hawking is a man who had to fight everything - literally death itself – to achieve his potential. And he does. When you look back on previous Oscar winners – Charlize Theron in 'Monster', for example – the awards lot like to see those physical transformations. Well, you might not get a better one than Eddie Redmayne this time round.Kudos also needs to be given to director James Marsh. Well, he got those performance out of the leads, so the plaudits are obvious, but he also does wonders with a strong supporting cast that includes David Thewlis, Harry Lloyd and a really lively Charlie Cox (though Emily Watson, a personal favourite of mine, is in it for what seems like a cup of coffee!). But his method of direction is brilliant. The film's style reflects Hawking's state – the first third is a lot of quick cuts and moving shots, almost overemphasising the natural agility and physical prowess Hawking had. Then, once he is diagnosed, the cinematography changes. The camera moves closer to the characters, right up close to Hawking's face and his body, almost unnervingly. It's a great tool, solidly executed.A word commonly being thrown about when people talk about this film is celebration. I wish I could be original and think of something else, but a celebration is exactly what 'The Theory Of Everything' is. A celebration of humanity, of faith, of science, of love, of life. The fact that Stephen Hawking is still alive today, after having been given just two years left to live, is a testament to his greatness. If you don't want to watch it for how inspirational it is, though, just watch it for Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones' transformative performances. They deserve it.",9,2,3,9 January 2015
Brave," A return to form for those Pixar geniuses
","Disney's ugly stepchild, affectionately known as Pixar, is back. Old reliable, usually, though their last outing was actually quite rubbish. Nobody in their right mind – adults and children alike – could claim Cars 2 was a cinematic success. It wasn't. But that was a mere glitch because, with Brave, they are back to their brilliant best.Brave is the story of Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a rebellious Scottish princess who prefers riding on her horse and using her bow than acting ladylike and princess-y. When the time comes for her to get married and fulfil her duty as princess, Merida decides to take matters into her own hands and consults a witch.Brave's biggest achievement is its attention to detail: this might all be CGI, yes, but Scotland has never looked so beautiful. The animation is as close to perfect as you could possibly get, which makes watching the film that much more enjoyable. What you really come to see, though, is a good story and great characters. Brave has both. Kelly MacDonald, as Merida, is brilliant. She's come a long way from Trainspotting all those years ago, and deservedly so. Here, she also has the benefit of voicing a beautifully-written character. Pixar has a history of creating well-rounded, real characters - just look at Toy Story, Up and Wall-E – and Brave can be added to that list.There's very little to fault about the movie, if I'm honest. When trying to be funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny. The emotion is emotional. It hits all the right notes, and never stops entertaining. I can't even complain about it being too long, because it's not. The thing about Pixar is that they concentrate on every single thing with utmost care and attention. The CGI is stunning, but it's also a brilliant story with excellent characters.It's refreshing to see that an American animation company can create such an authentically Scottish movie. Kudos.",8,9,17,16 September 2012
Paranormal Activity," A groundbreaking, albeit flawed, film
","Groundbreaking on its initial release, 'Paranormal Activity' still ranks as one of the best found-footage films, in my opinion. It's a pretty amazing achievement of the production team to make the film on such a tiny budget. Where this succeeds is where so many modern horrors fail: the ability to create a sense of fear and dread without relying on shocks and monsters. Don't get me wrong, we do have these in the movie, but there is more of the psychological terror that an audience would respond best to.It's not without its flaws though. The film is best during the night scenes, when the couple are asleep and the paranormal activities happen. Scenes during the day are pretty boring and not really worth much. The lead couple are good enough, but the several supporting cast are archetypal and dull. There is also a certain amount of suspension of disbelief required, which jars the film a bit. Why is the camera never put down during serious moments? Why don't they just leave? Obviously, these things remain for the sake of the storytelling, so you can let them off a bit. I only wish there was no need to.I haven't seen the sequels yet, but I've heard they're nowhere near as good. This, though, really was a good film. Despite its flaws, you can't deny that the film is genuinely terrifying at times.",7,0,0,19 September 2012
Elysium," That difficult, but successful, second album
","I'm gonna go off on a tangent for a bit, but trust me, I'm going somewhere with it. One of the most interesting things about music, to me, is the concept of the 'difficult first album'. When an artist or band releases a spectacular first album, all attention turns to what they'll do next. What happens next determines the longevity and the overall appeal of said musicians. Either they're exposed as one-hit wonders, or they prove that they can keep on being the great artists that they are.Elysium is Neil Blomkamp's difficult second album. For those of you living under a rock for the last few years, he was the creator of District 9, one of the best sci-fi/socio-political movies to hit the screen in a helluva long time. Bold, controversial, and highly entertaining, it breathed new life into science fiction.Fast-forward four years, and we have this new creation. Once again, it's a science fiction movie set in the future. Once again, it is a satire on the state of the modern world and (more importantly) the state of African politics. Once again, it's about one man's fight against something he should not be able to fight.Once again, Neil Blomkamp is on to a winner.The story quickly: Max (Matt Damon) lives on an Earth full of poverty and disease, while the privileged few live on another planet called Elysium, which is more or less Utopia. When he gets infected with a fatal virus, Max has no choice but to go on a mission to Elysium. The chances of success are near-impossible, but success could lead to total equality for the entire universe.Now, it has to be said, I don't think this is as good as District 9. There was something raw and unpolished about that movie which enhanced it. What makes Elysium so good, though, is the storyline. Just like its predecessor, it does a very smart job of mirroring the corruption and class divide we see in the world today, wrapping those concepts around a very taut and enjoyable thriller. Expectedly, Blomkamp once looks to the continent of Africa (his home) for inspiration, this time touching on the issues of poverty, disease and class alienation (no pun intended).Having a bigger budget also really helped Blomkamp this time round – he made good use of special effects in District 9, but he goes ten steps further in this film. Robots with crazy weapons, space shuttles, brilliant action scenes involving a lot of guns and quite a bit of fire – it is all very similar to the future of District 9, but amped up. Almost as if the world of those two films are the same.Interestingly enough, what hurts Elysium is probably what should have bettered it; that being the cast. Now, don't get me wrong, the cast is probably the main appeal of the film. Matt Damon in the lead role, Jodie Foster lurking around, it's not bad at all. But Damon never quite fits in the role, and I felt somebody else could have done a better job. Similarly, Jodie Foster's portrayal of the shady Elysium controller felt forced and unnatural. Funnily enough, the best performance comes from Sharlto Copley, who was the lead in District 9. He steals every scene he is in, which made me want him to be the leading man.As far as difficult second albums go, Elysium comes out as a success. It's probably not ideal to keep comparing it to District 9, but there are so many similarities between the two, it's hard not to. Elysium is a very strong, solidly-directed movie that reinforces Neil Blomkamp as one of the must-see directors going around. Worth going out of your way to see.",7,0,1,3 September 2013
Super 8," A solid, though flawed, homage
","Set in the 1980s, a group of friends are witness to a horrific train crash while filming a movie on their Super 8 camera. That sets into motion a chain of events involving the military, strange disappearances, and something very supernatural. It is left up to the kids to save the day.That, in short, is what 'Super 8' is about. It sounds like your typical PG science fiction movie aimed at teenagers and parents looking for a decent movie to watch. Thankfully, this JJ Abrams-directed movie is so much more than that. Foremost than anything else, 'Super 8' is an homage to the Spielberg classics of the eighties, and Abrams has deliberately copy-and-pasted that formula here.Of that formula, what Abrams has emulated the best is directing young actors. What made Spielberg films like 'ET' and 'The Goonies' so enjoyable was the chemistry between the young cast; it's the same here. The kids are the best thing about the movie – you're immediately drawn to them and root for them throughout. Joel Courtney (Joe), Elle Fanning (Alice) and Riley Griffiths (Charles) are the standouts, the performances seem to come so easily and naturally to them. Look in particular at Fanning's first 'acting' scene. It's brilliant.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bit of a letdown. Not because its rubbish, necessarily, but because nothing else in the film matches up to the joy of watching those kids act. The scenes with Kyle Chandler (as Joe's dad), the military, and other scenes with adults, they're quite dull and uninteresting. Similarly, the supernatural aspect of the film feels really rushed and unconvincing. I moved through the film just waiting for the kids to come back on screen. The actual story seems to get in the way, and that shouldn't be the case. There are some spectacular special effects though, especially the train crash at the beginning of the movie.To expect anybody – even someone as good as JJ Abrams – to come up with a movie that matches those eighties' Spielberg classics would be unfair. And, in all fairness, Abrams makes a good crack of it. While it could be better, I think 'Super 8' should be appreciated as a love letter. A love letter to the joy of filmmaking; a love letter to nostalgia; and mainly, a love letter to Steven Spielberg and what he brought to cinema.",7,0,1,1 November 2012
Groundhog Day," The perfect comedy, with the perfect comedy actor
","When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) travels to a small town for its annual Groundhog Day, he ends up living the same day over and over again. At first, it is a curse, but he soon finds that he can use it to his advantage.I wish I could tell you why it's taken me over twenty-six years to watch 'Groundhog Day' but, in truth, there isn't a good reason. There's no excuse for being deprived of such a fantastically written, fantastically acted romantic comedy.Yeah. I liked it.There's no disputing how talented Bill Murray is – if you've seen Ghostbusters or Caddyshack (or even The Royal Tenenbaums for more contemporary audiences), you already know. This, though, is his tour-de-force. It's not often that he's given the chance to play a leading man, but he does it with ease. His chemistry with Andie MacDowell is brilliant, as is his interplay with the other actors in the film. We could talk about how good everyone else is, and they are good, but that would take away from Murray. This is his movie, and he deserves all the accolades.But the writing needs to be commended too. Despite the somewhat frothy nature of the film, it does tackle some very serious topics. The idea of death; of immortality; of ego; of man's place in the world; of love. Pretty heavy stuff, all aptly handled within this 100-or-so-minute light comedy.I could probably try and think of something to criticise, in the interest of balanced journalism. But I won't do that. This film is a joy to see, and that's exactly how it should be remembered. You just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.",10,2,4,21 August 2013
The Lion King," One of Disney's greatest movies
","A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back.It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great – excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices.For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great.Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story.My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic.I'll stop masturbating now.",10,4,6,12 September 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A technical and creative masterpiece
","Take my advice and go see 'Birdman'. Maybe even watch it a second or a third time. Because, chances are, you're not going to see a film like this again for a very long time. Sure, there will be other great films, other magnificent films that are essential viewing, but films like this don't get made very often. So refreshing to see, in this age of cinema where everything is adapted or reimagined or sequelled, a film that is so utterly original.On the surface, it isn't too different from your standard independent dramedy – twenty years after playing an iconic superhero, washed-up actor Riggan Thomas is writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play. It's the last chance he has to rejuvenate his career, but everything around him is falling apart. His cast; his family; his sanity; it's all going wrong. As opening night draws closer, Riggan teeters closer and closer to the edge.You only need to scratch beneath that surface a tiny little bit to see that 'Birdman' is far from standard. Very ambitiously and very successfully, writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu edits the entire film as though it is one continuous shot. The camera tilts, swivels and slides along in one seamless motion, either chasing after its actors or panning across rooms and storeys. This is not just a technical achievement (a ridiculously big technical achievement, mind) but a creative one. Ensuring it was a success meant the cast essentially working through pages and pages of script, requiring the highest levels of concentration and acting finesse.But don't let all that fool you, this isn't just some fancy party trick – the cinematography does more to enhance the hysteria seen backstage at a theatre production than any montage ever could, and the constant movement of the camera is reflective of the central character's own ever-frenetic mind. Driven by fear, anxiety and pride, Riggan Thomas cannot stop. And the camera moves with him every step of the way.As Riggan, Michael Keaton is simply superb. It's ridiculous to think that it's been four years since he last headlined a movie, and even longer since he got a role as meaty as this. To say he makes the most of the opportunity is beyond an understatement. This was a role made for him, and the metaphysical in-jokes (George Clooney's chin is a lovely reference) only add to the nuances. Riggan Thomas is a man driven by the fear of losing everything, and Keaton expresses it all brilliantly. The sharp script obviously helps, but Keaton's ability to emote just with his eyes, or a twitch, is beautiful to watch. Just like McConaughey, this could see the beginning of Ketaon's resurgence. I sincerely hope so.Everyone else pitches in too, though. Zach Galifianakis' long-suffering producer; Naomi Watts' insecure young actress; Andrea Riseborough's frustrated girlfriend; Amy Ryan's exhausted ex-wife; they're all excellent in relatively small but significant roles. But of the supporting cast, Emma Stone and Edward Norton are a cut above. Norton is hilarious as the Broadway veteran, difficult to work with in his undying effort to find 'truth' on stage (mirroring Norton's own storied behavioural issues). Emma Stone, too, is just incredible. It's a character that starts off looking quite generic – young daughter out of rehab who doesn't give a crap about anyone – but she comes into her own in a big way. Stealing every scene she's in, including a fantastic final few seconds, Stone shows once again why she is one of the best actresses out there right now.There are a lot of big movies coming out this year – your Stars Wars and your Marvels – but this is already a frontrunner for movie of the year. Technically and creatively, 'Birdman' is a cinematic triumph, and a brilliant way to start the year. If this is the calibre of cinema we have to look forward to, we're in for a ride.So please. Go and watch 'Birdman'. And then think about watching it again.",10,7,16,6 January 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Not as good as the first film, but fun nonetheless
","Phase 1 of the Marvel Project is all done and dusted, a phase which started on a massive high with the first Iron Man (arguably the best solo Marvel superhero film to date), and ended on one with Avengers Assemble (the best Marvel film, in my opinion). Marvel Films did what was seemingly impossible, and did it unbelievably well. So, like millions of others, I waited with bated bread for Phase 2 to kick off. Iron Man 3 rolled around andheh. It wasn't an awful film and the Tony Stark character took an interesting turn, but it didn't live up to the success of his first two outings and the Marvel standard as a whole.Which brings us on to the next step of Phase 2 – Thor. The first film was one of the big surprises of the genre. While his other superhero friends are steeped in some level of reality, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is from an entirely different world, so the task of bringing him into 'our' world and making it believable was a tough one. But they did it, and the result was a thoroughly entertaining film that took advantage of the character's supernatural elements. With the sequel, directors Alan Taylor and James Gunn (taking over from Kenneth Branagh) decided to amp the supernatural side up even more.While the first movie introduces us to Asgard, Thor's home planet, The Dark World is set almost entirely in the alien world. This time, Asgard is under threat from an even darker foe hell-bent on literally destroying the entire universe. The epic plot allows the film to explore Asgard with much more detail, and we gain a better understanding of how the world works. Expectedly, we're treated to some gorgeous CGI and special effects, making it fun to watch. The fish-out-of-water formula is also subverted as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is now in Asgard, essentially playing our eyes and ears. Unfortunately, that formula isn't as successful as it was in the first movie. Watching Thor try to make sense of Earth is genuinely hilarious, but we don't quite get that with Foster. Funnier than that is seeing Foster's Earth friends go about their business (Kat Dennings, in particular, is very funny).In fact, the scenes in Asgard, as a whole, aren't overly amusing. That is, until, one Tom Hiddleston enters the fray.As Loki, Hiddleston is once again sublime. That scathing sarcasm, the wry smiles, his excellent diction and tone; everything about the performance is a pleasure to experience. It is by no means an exaggeration to suggest that he steals every scene he is in. My favourite scenes were the ones that he was in – just waiting for him to say something, and knowing it was going to be gold. And it pretty much always was. The character's journey in the film is also very gripping, and sets us up nicely for whatever might come next. Loki is to Thor what Iago is to Othello: he is the actual main character, he is the one we want to see. And just like people have argued that Shakespeare's play should be called Iago, I would strongly argue that the film should have been named after Loki.Where we have a problem is that, when Loki isn't on screen (and his screen time is crucial but limited), the film just never seems as engaging. I found myself missing the character, and wishing he was ever-present. I won't reveal any spoilers but will say the ending makes up for that longing, but that doesn't stop the film suffering because of it.This is, overall, why the sequel just doesn't work as well as the first film. And it isn't just the lack of Loki's presence; other characters I wanted to see more of were used sparingly. Kat Dennings, as mentioned before, was one of those characters; and Stellan Skarsgard was another. Instead, we saw a lot more of Anthony Hopkins (boring and uninspiring), Idris Elba (strong presence but also boring) and Christopher Ecclestone (who is completely unrecognisable but actually quite good).Don't get me wrong, The Dark World is not a bad film. It's much better than Iron Man 3, and there is enough excitement and good action to stop you getting bored. It just isn't as engaging as the first one, that's all. Sadly, Phase 2 of the Avengers Project has started with a bit of a whimper; we can only hope it gets better from here.",7,3,5,24 November 2013
Looper," This is a good movie, not a great movie
","Luckily, I managed to get into the cinemas for Looper before the run ended. A month since it released, and it still seems to be going strong. That privilege is reserved not for the big movies, but the big movies. And, ever since it got onto the radar, Rian Johnson's thriller was always referred to as one of those big movies. So I finally got my tickets and took my seat, and prepared for the big movie.By now, you've probably seen the movie and know what it's about. But if you don't, Looper is a time-travel thriller set in the not-so-distant future. In this present, hit men – known as loopers – assassinate men who have been transported back from the future by underworld gangsters. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of those loopers, but everything starts to go wrong when his next hit is himself (Bruce Willis).The plot is absolutely brilliant, it really is. Original, inventive, and provides so much scope for some amazing storytelling. Add to that a stellar cast, which also includes Jeff Daniels and Emma Blunt, and you've got a recipe for success. All the publicity about Looper seemed to suggest that this was going to be this generation's The Matrix.So it really annoys me that I was so disappointed. I wanted to love this movie, I wanted to be blown away the way I was when I watched Inception for the first time. Perhaps it was my fault for placing too much faith in it but, whatever it was, the movie disappointed me.I think that the movie just did not live up to the potential that amazing concept could offer. The idea of a man needing to kill his own future self is extremely exciting, but the novelty wore off very quickly. That's partly due to the fact that, like we see so often nowadays, Bruce Willis just wasn't that great. For the film to work, both Levitt and Willis needed to deliver, and the veteran messed up. As a result, I ended up not believing in what he was trying to do.Levitt, on the other hand, is really good. He's fast becoming one of my favourite actors, and he gives another strong performance. A lot was made about his prosthetic face, and rightfully so. His whole complexion is different and, while he doesn't really look like Bruce Willis, he does a decent job of acting like him. Emma Blunt, too, is excellent, and is probably the real emotional heart of the film (even more so than the two men).But it's probably her character that antagonised me the most. She's an integral part of the second half of the movie, where the entire plot is turned on its head. It should have been a brilliant twist; instead, I was left scratching my head a little and wondering what happened to my time travel thriller. The new plot twist plays out very predictably, and ends even more predictably.There is still a lot to like about Looper; it's a great view on what our future could be like, and there are some brilliant performances from the supporting cast (Paul Dano and Garret Dillahunt come to mind). Action scenes, even some of the more emotional scenes, are good. This is still a good movie, don't get me wrong. What disappoints me is that the film takes too many twists and turns, with the badly-executed twists cancelling out the better ones; leaving you with a somewhat anticlimactic end.Rian Johnson is still a director to pay attention to, and Looper is still a watchable movie. Maybe the hype killed it for me. Maybe if I watch it again in a year's time, my opinion will have changed. But for now, I write this as a disappointed film fan.",7,0,2,4 November 2012
The Fighter," Two fantastic performances at the heart of a good film.
","Art imitates life in more ways than one in 'The Fighter'. As those who have seen it know, it's based on the true story of Boston-born boxers Mickey and Dickie Ward. We even see their real-life counterparts in the film. But it's quite interesting that the two lead actors are quite similar to their boxing equivalents. Bale is accomplished, experienced, the man who has it all. Unlike Dickie, though, Bale hasn't thrown it all away; and if he keeps giving electric performances like this one, he probably won't.And like Mickey Ward, Wahlberg is a once under-appreciated actor who has slowly started to prove his doubters (including me) wrong. With this, he shows once again that he can be versatile. I don't think he is as good as Bale in this, but that's probably because Bale's character is just so extravagant. Both men, though, are brilliant. And the Oscar nods were greatly deserved.The film never stops being boring – the two hour run-time flies by. There's ample support from the likes of Melissa Leo and Amy Adams, all playing integral roles in the story. The star of the show is Christian Bale though. He's a far cry from the Bruce Wayne we saw earlier this year; it's a thin and scraggly Bale, getting into the heart of the character as he always does brilliantly.A great movie.",8,0,0,27 September 2012
