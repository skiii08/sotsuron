The King's Speech," Easily fits into my top ten
","Public speaking is not an easy thing to do. But it is even harder when you have a stammer/stutter. The Duke of York (Bertie) has struggled with this all of his life and has been seeking help but has found none suitable for him. His wife finds a different kind of treatment given by a man named Lionel Logue that is described as 'unorthodox and controversial'. As Bertie begins seeing this 'doctor', he notices an improvement. Initially, when I heard about this movie and all of the raving reviews, I was honestly afraid I would find it dreadfully uninteresting. But when I did see it, I was surprised at how amazing and interesting it really is. You can add mine to that long list of positive reviews. Colin Firth, whom I had previously seen in 'Disney's A Christmas Carol', won an Academy Award for this role, and rightfully so. He is so compelling and believable that is is hard to imagine him not being in this role of the Duke. Also, Helena Bonham Carter, in a role noticeably different than her usual, pulls off Queen Elizabeth very well and fits into it much better than one might expect. And, of course, Geoffrey Rush is perfect as the untrained doctor. This beautiful achievement easily fits into my top ten films.",10,0,1,21 January 2013
The Mask," Mindlessly silly but not very funny
","'You gotta ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya?' The answer is: not really. At least, I could have felt a lot luckier if this film was a lot better. Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a nice guy who can't stick up for himself. One day, he finds a mask that transforms him into the man that he wants to be but doesn't have the courage to do so. The mask even makes his crush fall for him. Although this all may sound creative, which to me it does, this movie was disappointing. I expected more from Jim Carrey and despite being amusing at times, it should've and could've been a lot funnier. There were only a few scenes when I genuinely laughed and when you have Jim Carrey in a comedic role with a story as wacky and creative as this one, it is no doubt there should be more.",5,1,5,29 August 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Disappointing
","I have never read 'The Incredible Hulk' comic strip. I have never seen the Bill Bixby TV series. I didn't even see the 2003 movie 'Hulk'. In fact, the only connection I have with the Hulk, is that I owned the the famous Hulk Hands toys as a young child. I watched this movie primarily so I could become familiar with each of the individual superheros before watching the recent popular movie, 'The Avengers'. It started off encouraging, showing flashbacks of how the Hulk came to be. Actually one of the coolest intros I have ever seen. Too bad that can't be said about the entire film. Everything about it felt a little off. First of all, I found much of the fault to be in the characterization of Bruce Banner. He felt very distant throughout. Yes, I understand he needs to be mellow, as to show the significant difference between him as Bruce and him as the Hulk, but even so. Edward Norton was not enjoyable to watch in this role. In addition, it really didn't feel like a superhero movie. I didn't see the Hulk as a hero and the villain didn't show up until the last twenty minutes. I did enjoy the small cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark. That for me was the highlight. Another cool thing about the film is that Lou Ferrigno, the original voice of the Hulk, is still lending his voice for this role. However, I am sorry to say that this movie was predictable and overall a disappointment. After watching this, I am quite interesting in seeing the the 2003 big screen adaption as to compare the two.",5,0,0,15 February 2013
Coraline," A story told best this way
","Neil Gaiman is the Tim Burton of literature. While Tim Burton is making movies like 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Corpse Bride', Neil Gaiman is write novels such as 'Coraline' and 'The Graveyard Book'. This is not a better person to bring this story to life than Tim Burton collaborator, Henry Selick. Coraline Jones is a young girl who feels neglected by her parents and doesn't want much to do with her neighbors Miss Spink, Miss Forcible, Mr. Bobinsky, and her new friend Wybie. While exploring her new house, she escapes to a strangely sinister, yet perfect world. She finds better parents, better food, and a better home. The only strange thing is: everyone has buttons for eyes. The more she spends time there, the more she realizes that it is not what she wanted. In this spooky tale, you will find great lessons of thankfulness and appreciation. However, it is not a movie you will want to be showing to sensitive or easily frightened children, as it is creepy and filled with abnormal images. I have read Neil Gaiman's original novel and, because it is such a visual and imaginative story, I think that it works better on screen. The stop-motion animation captures it better than another other form of storyteller could and it looks absolutely stunning.",9,0,0,6 January 2013
Dead Poets Society," I like everything about this movie; except the movie itself
","I like poetry. I like Robin Williams. I like Peter Weir. I like Maurice Jarre. So, I had high hopes for this movie and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. It seems in almost every dramatic or semi-dramatic film that Robin Williams stars in, he plays a victim. I kept waiting for him to be picked on and it sure came. John Seating is a new teacher at a very strict school called Welton. His styles and teaching methods are not what the students are used to and his love for poetry inspires them to reopen an old school club called the Dead Poets Society. At this point, the movie falls downhill. I think the problem is the characters. The director tries to make us love and connect with them, oh how hard he tries. But, oh how much I didn't care by the end. We needed to know more about John Seating's personal life and not just his job. Besides a few good themes scattered throughout, there is not a lot to gain by watching this film.",5,1,3,3 February 2013
Ed Wood," A good movie about bad movies
","This is definitely a good movie about bad movies. I had seen every Tim Burton film except this and his remake of 'Planet of the Apes' so, due to my interest in old movies and in Johnny Depp, I thought I would finally sit down and watch it. And I'm glad I did. Edward D. Wood Jr. was a bizarre filmmaker who movies are legendary for being awful. But he doesn't know. He is happy and optimistic about every penny he can get and every person he can meet. He is especially excited when he sees the no longer acting, Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau, winning him an Academy Award. The movie was shot entirely in black and white, primarily because no one knew how Bela Lugosi would look in color. And it looks incredible. From the promising start with the graves and the lighting, it really feels like an old horror movie. Now, the movie as a whole was good but it there are some questionable aspects of it such as the language, which was unnecessary, and the way Ed's crew disrespected the Baptist church. Other than those and a few other things, the film was a lot of fun to watch and was interesting to see an important piece of Hollywood history. Now, I''m gonna go watch some of Ed Wood's bad movies!",7,1,2,23 January 2013
Terminator Salvation," Why was this movie made?
","I'm back. And I'm upset. I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the first Terminator films. The first two few told the story and the third was just plain fun. This however, was an unnecessary mess. The minute the movie started, I could tell something wasn't right. This installment takes place after Judgement Day. First of all, they brought in an entire new cast. They could have easily brought back Nick Stahl for John Conner and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster but they replaced both. Christian Bale is an ideal John Conner, I suppose, but I his performance was so emotionless that I didn't care about him at all. And Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate chose not to continue the the feisty personality that made so fun to watch. She feels like a completely different person here. The script is poorly written and so instead, the movie is filled with scene after scene of meaningless war and battle sequences. It is very average, clich√©, mainstream, Hollywood entertainment (I wouldn't even go so far to say it's entertainment) I don't know how any fan of the originals could enjoy this movie. We learned and saw all we needed to know of the future and Judgement Day from the flash forwards in the first three films. The scenes that worked the best were with Helena Bonham Carter and Arnold Schwarzenegger but, unfortunately for us, those were few. I highly recommend to skip this 'Terminator' film if you are a fan, as it adds nothing important to the series. I hope the new reboot will be better.",4,29,56,28 August 2013
Sleepy Hollow," Skip it.
","Tim Burton has made two horror movies: first this and then in 2007, he made Sweeney Todd. Sweeney Todd was unbelievably great. This however, was not. The film opens with the first of three murders that occur in the small community of Sleepy Hollow. The victims are found decapitated, their heads missing. These strange happenings attract scientific detective Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, to solve the mystery. The townspeople are certain that the murderer is the ghost of the Headless Horseman, who lived in Sleepy Hollow years ago. Ichabod Crane is insistent on proving that this is not a supernatural figure, but after a few more murders, even he begins to believe it as well. First of all, this movie is in no way scary. I enjoy being scared and if I intend to see a horror movie, then I would hope and expect to be scared. This did not do it for me. After the first few murders, I lost interest. The movie mainly consisted of the Headless Horseman running around, and chopping people heads off. Oh, and don't forget, yelling 'Aah!' It was a bit hard to take seriously. Also, Johnny Depp was quite mild and disappointing in the lead. He has had far better roles in other films. Despite the talented people involved, this movie was a major disappointment and a dud.",4,1,4,18 November 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
","'Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few had trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.'Those are the opening lyrics to the 1979 Broadway production with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The movie version, made 28 years later with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, will blow you away. The entire film is so unique and so strange that you can't help but take in the awe of it. It is the story of a troubled barber who was imprisoned after a judge took his wife away. Years later, he returns to London where there is no sign of his wife and now his daughter is locked away in the Judge's house. His goal now, is to bring in customers, primarily the Judge, and slit their throats so that his new friend, Mrs. Lovett can make them into delectable 'meat pies'. And the best part of it all is that it is a musical and all of the actors, never previously singers, have unbelievable good voices that are very enjoyable to listen to and fit the story. The majority of musical films seem to be quite upbeat and contain large amounts of dancing, but this has neither. I prefer dark musicals such as this and also 'Les Miserables', because I think it is harder to bring those emotions out in song and this kind of musical has much more meaning to me. Every actor in this picture does an incredible job in their individual role and I don't believe that a single actor was miscast. What's more, the writer of the stage musical, Stephen Sondheim, approved which he often doesn't do with movie adaptations. Tim Burton really scores on this one.",10,1,1,27 January 2013
Corpse Bride," Movie about death isn't as interesting as it may sound
","'I do'. Those are two words that Victor Van Dort just can't seem to say. He practices and practices but saying his vows aren't an easy thing for him to do. Perhaps it's because he barely knows her and doesn't love her. Or because he is a nervous wreak. Which is it? Either way, it clearly isn't going according to plan. Victor wanders off into the forest and while practicing his vows yet again, he finally gets them right. Unfortunately, it happens at a very inconvenient time. A dead woman, buried in the ground, has been waiting for the perfect man to come and say the exact words that Victor said and she believes it to be for real. She brings him into the world of the dead which is not at all what he is looking for. Tim Burton's idea is a strange and creative one but, to me, there was clearly something missing. Johnny Depp does a mediocre job playing the selfless and kindhearted Victor but that's just it; its mediocre. Same goes for Helena Bonham Carter as the corpse bride and most of the other voice actors. But as I said, Tim Burton's ideas are creative as usual, and the animation that he hadn't used since 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', works well here.",6,0,0,22 September 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Highly entertaining
","Have you ever dreamt of being an American hero? Steve Rodgers certainly has but he hasn't yet found much success in making his fantasy become a reality. Steve is small, weak, and awkward. He has tried to enlist in Army but has been refused. After meeting a friendly doctor who decides to give him a try, he joins the Army and soon after becomes part of an experiment to test drugs that will strengthen him and give him a better chance to be successful. While all this is going on, a madman named Schmidt is attempting to take over the world. This film, set in the 1940s, feels more like a war movie than a superhero movie. Either way however, director Joe Johnston pulls it off and does it very well. It is highly entertaining, with perfect acting, grand sets, and a first-class story. I especially liked Tommy Lee Jones' performance as the rough colonel. As it began, I was comparing the characters of Steve Rodgers and Peter Parker, from Spider-Man, who both are week and not at all hero-like but become powerful as the stories go on. However, there couldn't be a bigger difference between the two because Steve Rodgers is so much more of a stronger and likable character altogether. Although it starts out slow and some of it is a bit silly, the entire movie is a joy to watch and everything comes together in an unforgettable picture.",9,3,5,22 September 2012
Hugo," A masterpiece in filmmaking
","I went into this film, not knowing much about it other than it has been much loved since its release last year. And rightfully so. 'Hugo' is one of the most unique and captivating movies I have ever seen. Hugo Cabret is a young orphan who isn't quite sure what he wants to do with his life, except for one thing he is absolutely certain of: fixing a strange mechanical man that could not be completed due to his fathers death. One day, when trying to steal from a toy maker, his plan backfires and the toy maker takes something very important to Hugo: his fathers notebook. In his attempt to get it back, he meets a young girl and together they find out that there is more to this toy maker than what meets the eye. Throughout the first hour, I wasn't sure where it all was going but everything couldn't have come together in a more enjoyable or astounding way. I can see how this movie would appeal specifically to film buffs, like myself, because of the numerous direct references to the early history of film and how cinema really is how it is portrayed here: dreams coming alive.",10,5,8,26 August 2012
Edward Scissorhands," An intriguing and unique movie
","It is movies like this that remind me why I love movies so much. As I sat and watched 'Edward Scissorhands', I had a smile on my face almost from beginning to end. Once upon a time, there was an eccentric inventor who lived alone in a large mansion. Making gadgets was something he loved to do and there was something he created that was different and unique: a man with scissors for hands which he fittingly named Edward Scissorhands. The inventor planned on giving him real hands, but as he was old, he died before he could do so. This left Edward with those scissors for life. He continued to live up in mansion until a lady found him alone and decided to take him in. She showed him what it was like to live in the real world and he quickly fell in love with her daughter, Kim and became the center of attention for the whole town. As of 2012, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together in exactly 8 films, this one being the first. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job as the innocent and often clueless Edward Scissorhands and his performance and acting style blends perfectly with Tim Burton's bizarre fantasy stories. Tim Burton is my favorite director of all time because he is able to produce movies with stories that are exactly what appeal to me and have appealed to me since I was a young child: dark, intriguing, creative, unique, and often creepy. I have only have one complaint about this movie: the neighbors were painful and quite annoying to watch. But the good scenes were so great that they helped compensate for these painful scenes. And Edward is not just a character; he is a symbol for those who are different than others and who don't quite seem to fit in in life and I am here to say that this alone made the him one of the most likable characters I have ever seen in on screen.",9,0,0,8 September 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," New and improved Spidey
","When I initially heard about this reboot, I was skeptical. Why make them again so soon? When I was little, the Spider-Man movies came out and those were the first superhero movies I ever watched. I loved them. However, as I got older, I realized that much of what makes up those movies was quite cheesy, particularly Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker. But this is not a review of those. I am reviewing the new and improved 'amazing' Spider-Man. And I am pleased to say that it was surprisingly well done and very worthwhile. What was really missing from the previous installments was that level of darkness and threat that is present here. This film offers a dark, fresh new take on the traditional Spider-Man that I think you will enjoy. The characters are more engaging and more developed. I don't have much to say about this is terms of complaints. It is a refreshing, enjoyable piece of entertainment. Also, in all of Stan Lee's cameo appearance, I think this one is my favorite.",8,3,8,9 February 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Creative and unique
","Have you ever wondered what it would be like to combine the holidays of Christmas and Halloween? If so, Tim Burton answered it in 1993 with his release of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. The film opens in Halloweentown with shots of ghosts, skeletons, vampires, and witches. Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king and a highly respected citizen. He is lonely and sad, though, because he wants something more than scares and frights. When walking through a forest, he comes across a door that takes him to Christmasland and he instantly knows; this is what he has been looking for. What he decides to do is this: replace Santa this Christmas and put his own spin on things. To do it his own way. This movie, inspired by Tim Burton's poem, is enchanting to look at and the animation is unbelievable. However, don't be expecting a lot of Christmas cheer in this holiday story because it is lacking in that aspect. Also, being a Christian, I found the lack of any mention of the birth of Christ disappointing. However, Christmas is portrayed as something special, so much so that Jack can't even explain it to his friends. And that in itself shows that Christmas is not a regular holiday like any other. Jack's intentions also are good, for he wants to give and make people joyful. Though it is not perfect, I still think it is quite a good movie, primarily because of its creativeness and originally, both of which are qualities that always appeal to me. I also highly recommend reading the original poem or even better, listening to Christopher Lee read it with the animation and art from the movie. You can watch it on Blu-ray or DVD and I actually enjoyed even more than the movie. I also found it on YouTube. The poem itself is available in a beautifully animated storybook that I will be sure to purchase.",8,1,1,2 September 2012
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," If only Roald Dahl had been alive to see this
","If only Roald Dahl had been alive to see this. One of the greatest children's authors of all time, Roald Dahl, wrote the story of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in 1964. In 1971, a musical film adaptation was released with the title 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory'. Unfortunately, Roald Dahl himself hated the film, so much so that he refused to allow them to adapt his sequel. Tim Burton didn't like the original either and, as he does so well, he put his own familiar spin on it. Johnny Depp was the perfect casting choice as the lonely Willy Wonka, with similarities to his earlier character, Edward Scissorhands. I saw this film in the IMAX theater with its release in 2005 and instantly loved it. I have enjoyed it just as much every time since and I still smile when the Oompa Loompa's sing and when Willy Wonka presents to the children his chocolate room. Although I was one of the many who actually liked the original, I find this one better because with the absence of the unnecessary musical numbers, among other things, this is closer to Roald Dahl's story in tone and in content. I believe if he had been alive he would have enjoyed it, as I did, and I hope you do too.",9,0,5,28 September 2012
Big Fish," Very inspiring and original
","Has someone ever told you a story that was so awe-inspiring and so fantastic that you wondered if it could possibly be true? This is how William Bloom feels about his father, Edward Bloom. So much so that he doesn't even talk to him anymore. Edward Bloom is a storytelling, eager to tell everyone about his life adventures. Will knows they can't be true and so as his father grows close to death, he decides to set things straight. This film, based on Daniel Wallace's book, is one of my favorites because it clearly portrays a life well lived. Edward Bloom is one of the most inspiring characters I have ever seen on screen because he puts so much into life; and gets so much out of it. Tim Burton's usual films are quite dark in tone, but with this, he takes a break from that style, while still managing to put his unmistakable creativeness and true sense of wonder into it. I also highly recommend Daniel Wallace's book which is just as good, if not better, than the movie.",10,1,2,4 September 2012
Groundhog Day," A comedy that is much more than funny
","What would you do if you had to relive the same day over and over? Would you go insane? Kill yourself? Fall in love? On one of Phil Conners least favorite days of the year, February 2, he reports the weather just like he does every other day. But somehow he makes it through the day with his sarcastic comments and bad-mannered nature, waiting for tomorrow; hoping it is better. But tomorrow never comes. This movie brings so much more to the table than one would expect. Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role who learns important lessons throughout. The fact this it is labeled as a comedy is one that I think is wrong; that is merely one of the qualities that it offers. It is hilarious, heart breaking, touching, and inspiring, all of which I would hope to see in a film. I loved it so much that I even want to put the song 'I Got You Babe' as my alarm in the morning.",9,0,1,6 January 2013
Thor," Better than I expected
","After watching 'The Incredible Hulk' and reading negative reviews of this movies, I was dreading watching it. But I am pleased to say that it surpassed my expectations. When Thor is banished from his home world, he lands in New Mexico in the presence of three scientists. They aren't sure what to do with him and as they get to know him, they find that there is more to him than what meets the eye. Meanwhile back home, his father has fallen into a sort of coma and his brother is now the ruler. And not a very good one at that. Chris Hemsworth does a great job in the lead role as does Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Loki. The movie felt refreshing and although a bit cheesy, it was entertaining. Not as good as 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger', but not bad.",7,1,2,4 March 2013
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful movie
","What if you saw things that weren't there? Met people that didn't exist? Went through life not knowing what is real? Sadly, that is the case for real life doctor, John Nash. He has schizophrenia. But he doesn't know it yet. He is a brilliant mathematician who is socially awkward and doesn't like people. The few people he does like are his roommate Charles and his boss Parcher. The problem is, they may be imaginary. When his wife tells him that he has delusions, he doesn't believe it and will stop at nothing to prove that he is right. Russell Crowe plays a very convincing schizophrenic and does a great job portraying this horribly troubled doctor at various stages in his life. I love movies that are based on true stories, such as this one, and what makes them even better is if they are inspirational, such as this one. It is indeed a beautiful movie and one that demands multiple viewings.",10,6,8,27 January 2013
Psycho," The master of suspense is in full force here
","Welcome to the Bates Motel. 12 cabins, 12 vacancies. What are you doing here? Running from the police? Alright, well enjoy your stay and see you in the morning. Or maybe not. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most influential and fiendishly wonderful movie makers of the twentieth century. Before 'Psycho', I had seen exactly 22 of Hitchcock's pictures. Most of them I enjoyed but none of them were as memorable as this piece of work. It is not just a cinematic accomplishment but also of successfully portraying someone who is indeed psycho. This movie was a shock when released in 1960 because of the way the movie was laid out. For example, it was unthinkable for a main character to be killed so early in the film. The goal was to put the audience on edge to the point where they had no idea what would happen next. And Hitchcock indeed pulled it off. In fact, he was sure to make clear that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie had begun. You must watch it from beginning to end. I am not going to tell you the plot because the less you know, the better. They don't call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.",10,1,1,17 November 2012
Whiplash," Hard to sit through, but though provoking
","Whiplash is rightly named. Just like a piece of music, a film has many components that must come together for it to work. You can't have a film without actors, without a script, or without a director. For this particular piece of music, all you need is a drummer and a teacher who will do anything to for a successful performance. I believe that is what Damien Chazelle has done here. He has pushed his actors as well as his audience to their limits and then some. The question this movie asks is: how far is too far? And the beautiful thing is that it never answers it and that was precisely Damien Chazelle's intention when he wrote the ending. We, as the audience, must decide for ourselves. I didn't enjoy sitting through this movie, but that doesn't make it bad. It made me think and ultimately it did what it set out to do. For that, I applaud it.",9,2,5,24 May 2015
Jaws," Watch it. Just watch it.
","Some movies have such a powerful effect on someone that it makes them take action. Or, in this case, not take action. For instance, after watching 'Jaws', I may never go into the water again. And if I do, splashing is not an option. The first time this was a few years ago and frankly, I remember it being boring. I am here to say I no longer think that. Yes, it is a bit slow at times but as a whole, that takes nothing away from this movie. Martin Brody is a police deputy on a popular resort island. One morning, he discovers a woman has been killed by what looks like a shark. He panics and plans to shut down the beach, but the mayor just dismisses it as a boating accident. When another shark attack occurs, a search team goes to find and kill the shark but a specialist named Matt Hooper discovers it's the wrong one. This leads to another bigger search involving a man named Quint and together the three men go on a mission to find this shark. With good acting, a good script, and an excellent plot, this is a fabulous film that is definitely a must see.",10,3,7,1 September 2012
Dark Shadows," Good but a but overlong
","Barnabas Collins is a vampire cursed by a witch who is love and, unfortunately for him, Barnabas does not return her love. He is left in a casket for more than a century and when released, he finds that he has landed in the year 1972. Johnny Depp can play almost any role that is thrown his way. A pirate, a hatter, and a vampire. The latter is shown here and it is interesting and amusing to see him play a vampire from the 1700s. Tim Burton's macabre and creepy humor comes out throughout, with Johnny Depp definitely helping with that. It is also considerably dark and while trying to maintain the comedy over the course of almost two hours, the movie has its ups and down. The sexual content is a bit much as well and would have been perfectly fine without it. However, I enjoyed it because you develop feelings for the characters and it certainly does grab you and make you want to learn how it all turns out. 'Dark Shadows' is also a perfect Halloween movie.",7,2,4,3 October 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Perfect in every way
","'Winds in the east, mist coming in. Like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store. But I fear what's to happen, all happened before.' We hear the these iconic words over the first notes of the first song from Mary Poppins, and as the camera panned through the clouds (just like in 'Mary Poppins'), I began to grin. And, between a few tears, that grin stayed on my face until the very end. I have never in my life fallen in love with a movie so quickly. For those of you unfamiliar with the plot, 'Saving Mr. Banks' is about the 'Mary Poppins' author P.L. Travers, played here by Emma Thompson in a brilliant performance. It is about her childhood, her inspiration, and her difficulties as an adult with her haunting memories of an alcoholic father. She published her famous children's' novel in the 1934 and 30 years later was released as a movie. What audiences of that time did not know, was the struggles it took for that to happen. Walt Disney was adamant that he wanted the rights, but Mrs. Travers simply refused to give them to him. For 20 years, he pushed and for 20 years, she denied. There are a select few movies that cannot be described in words. My favorite movie, the 2012 musical adaptation of 'Les Miserables' is one. 'The Mosquito Coast' is another. The power of these films is something that needs to be experienced, not told, but I am giving my best effort here. Every single performance is a gem. Emma Thompson is incredible. I honestly can say I have never seen a a more convincing portrayal of a real human being than hers. Tom Hanks does not look or sound like Walt Disney, but he captures his charisma and spirit perfectly. Very similar to Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock last year. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are delightful as the Sherman Brothers and it gives me real comfort in knowing that Robert Sherman himself (Jason Schwartzman's character) was on set ensuring that the story be told right and the performances be accurate. Ralph Giamatti is a subtle wonder as the very American chauffeur. But I have perhaps saved the best for last. Colin Farrell portrays his character so accurately that it is almost painful to watch. Disney Studios has done a horrible job marketing this movie because, contrary to what the commercials imply, it is NOT a family movie. If you want a family movie, watch 'Mary Poppins'. The themes are so mature and powerful here, a child would not enjoy or understand this movie at all. However, for those of us who have grown up with 'Mary Poppins', this movie is beyond anything I could possibly say. The transitions between Travers' childhood in Australia, and the present in Los Angeles were so smooth you never felt you were taken out of either story, as is sometimes the fault with that idea. The script is excellent. So many beautiful monologues and quotes, I couldn't even count. The music is excellent. Thomas Newman's score very much captures the style and essence of the 60's while slipping in bits of the 'Mary Poppins' repertoire, all in all making it practically perfect in every way. Also, what I found particularly effective, was their use of a few 'Mary Poppins' scenes. I am so thankful Disney Studios made this film because they have the rights to the original material and used it well and sparingly. One of the best films of the year and of all time. Every expectation and hope I had was completely blown out of the water and topped, a feat which I thought impossible, because I set the bar very very high.

The Truman Show," 'Good morning! And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night!'
","Truman Burbank leads a normal life. He wakes up and goes to a normal job, kissing his normal wife goodbye, and greeting all of the normal people in his normal little town. However, I cannot say that 'The Truman Show' is normal. Far from it. It is the originality and uniqueness of this film that makes it so memorable. One day, after years of this ordinary life, he decides he wants to take action and actually gain experiences. To have an adventure or two. The problem is, that as much as he tries, everything is getting in his way. That is when he becomes suspicious about why the world seems to be revolving around his life. All of this pointing to the fact that he is being watched around the clock by the entire world. This is one of those movies that sticks with you long after the credits. And as you drive to work the next morning, you will be careful to avoid smashing the camera on your windshield.",8,1,2,18 August 2012
Beetlejuice," Not good enough
","Death is a strange thing in cinema because every filmmaker decides their own way of presenting the afterlife. In 'Beetlejuice', Tim Burton has young married couple Adam and Barbara Maitland killed in a car accident in the first ten minutes of that film. Before they died, they moved into a large country house with the intention of fixing it up a bit. Now that they have died and are ghosts, an annoyed new family named the Deetzs' have moved into their house and the Maitlands want them out. They learn about a 'bio-exorcist' who they want to hire to scare the people away. This just creates problems however. The story continues and they become friends with Deetzs' daughter Lydia who has more in common with the ghosts than her own family. Unfortunately, the movie isn't as worthwhile as it may sound because the majority of the characters just aren't interesting enough to hold the movie together. Also, with the incantations and all the references to the supernatural, it isn't even close to my Christian values. However, it is a silly movie, all done tongue-in-cheek and shouldn't be taken seriously. Still, there isn't much of a reason to see it other than Michael Keaton's insane performance as Betelgeuse which is quite fun to watch although he wasn't in it as much as I would have liked. And as always, Tim Burton's crazy visuals and ideas are always original.",6,0,5,9 September 2012
