The Blair Witch Project," What a waste of money!
","After seeing this movie, I cannot believe all the hype about it.  It was the poorest made movie I've seen in a long time.  If you are at all susceptible to motion sickness, you do NOT want to see this.  Heather either runs with the camera or swings it around so often that you spend most of the movie trying not to throw up.  The only suspenseful part was the last 15 minutes and from the comments of people leaving the theater, most of them didn't understand the end of it.  When it was over, one of the people in the theater actually stood up and asked how many other people wanted their money back!  I went with a group of 5 people and none of us liked the movie, nor were we scared by it; that includes two 13 year olds.  I think the only reason this movie has made it to theaters is because of the belief by so many people that it is true.  But instead it's just a really awful movie.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
