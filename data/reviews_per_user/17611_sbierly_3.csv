The Monuments Men," What a pathetic sellout of an important book
","How very sad I am after finally watching this highly anticipated movie. I recently read the book, and while the story is a bit dry it's simultaneously huge in stature, an overlooked historical chapter of WWII, and a moving philosophical insight that has permanently changed my perspective on the importance of art to humanity.George Clooney, for shame. This movie is a complete bastardization of the true story, what did you do, just read the cliff notes and wing it? Most of what was portrayed in the movie didn't happen. This is not a comedy. You changed everyone's names so you could make their characters more interesting? So you could give them a drinking problem? Add a bit of sex scandal? Outrageous.This movie is an embarrassment to history, to the men who personify this story, and to the book it claims to be based on. I will only commend the making of this film in the attempt to bring the story to a wider audience, to that I say 'bravo', but I am very sad at the resulting product.",4,0,0,17 August 2014
Spectre," One of the worst Bond movies in the franchise (think Moonraker)
","I'm just amazed that so many others think this is a great Bond film. I'm so, so disappointed, not only for the franchise, but also for Daniel Craig, who is amazing as Bond (and, well, just amazing)! Perhaps it was simply so deep that it was over my head, but I found that the story hardly made any sense at all. People are talking about it going back to the 'old formula'. What does that mean? Here's a good example--there has to be the villain's henchman who is impressive and yet you hate him, waiting for his ultimate doom. Think odd-job, and his hat, or Jaws and his, you know, teeth. In Spectre, they produce early on, right? Bad guy with the signature attack move (avoiding spoilers) shows his stuff, and while he is featured throughout the rest of the movie, he leaves you disappointed.In other scenes there is loud drama (when the girl is being played a video), 'turn it off!', yet there is complete ambiguity as to what the drama means. Never resolved, like many other loose ends in the film. The entire significance of the visually impressive opening scene is really not clear at all. Just an excuse for some action for the 'formula' and the trailer.And the villain himself? I liked Christoph Waltz's performances in the Tarantino films, excellent films, excellent acting and roles. But after a while, you realize it's less acting than just Christoph himself (think Owen Wilson--who I love by the way, but...you know what I mean). It gets tiring, and he simply wasn't a compelling bad guy. And really?, the plot line here as to the connection? Where the heck did that come from?I'm sorry, but this was a terrible waste of many $M and some fine actors. Having said all this, it was a fun movie, you can't not enjoy any Bond film on the big screen, but given all the crap movies being made these days, there is just no excuse for wasting a Bond film.",5,10,23,11 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Seriously questioning the integrity of the Oscars now...
","I don't get it. I placed this film on my watch list simply due to the Oscar attention, and wins, although I was seriously skeptical that a movie of this sort was really all that. I figured that beyond the way it looked in the trailers that I so easily dismissed, they must have really broken artistic ground, must have knocked the acting out of the park, the story, they must have really done something special here. Nope! The movie was worse than any low expectations I initially had.The funny thing is, I watched this movie following a debate about the integrity of the Oscars--which I defended!--and then we watched this movie. Now I have my doubts, there is simply no rational explanation for the accolades bestowed upon this film beyond some ulterior motives, beyond somebody making money on this process.The characters in this film were all caricatures of anything that made any sense, yet so amped-up and just silly that the it seemed everyone involved was on speed while writing, producing, and acting this out. Completely hollow characters, shallow and essentially empty plot, the film managed to be riveting only through non-stop action that as I look back feels a bit like a PTSD recollection of Clockwork Orange Alex watching it strapped down with eyes forced open.The movie was indeed a visual wonder and spectacle, and I enjoyed watching it. If it was just there, adorned with low expectations, looking unloved, and I watched it without bias--then, perhaps, would I simply say 'wow, what a neat blockbuster extravaganza, typical Hollywood, shallow, but who cares, it was fun'. But for this movie to win all these awards, I feel completely sick about the entire Oscars enterprise. Between this, and the fiasco of the worst Oscars ceremony I've ever witnessed, they now have a long way to go before I pay as much attention to them as I once did. Too bad...",6,6,11,6 March 2016
