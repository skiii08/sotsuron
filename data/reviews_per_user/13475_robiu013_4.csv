Your Name.," If sappy love stories with magical realism are your thing
","With 'Your Name' storming up to MAL's top, I had to check it out for myself and experience this phenomenon, that has a score of 9,40 out of 10 at the time of writing. With so many people agreeing, that it's a masterpiece, it has to be good, right? Well turns out I didn't enjoy it quite as much the majority of MAL users.Plot: The story starts fair enough. Our main character suffers from 'Disney princess syndrome'; she's not satisfied with the surroundings she was born in and wants to see the world, that is so much bigger than what she knows. Luckily for her, magical realism is a thing in her world as well. Out of nowhere she gets the chance to live out her dreams by switching bodies with a boy from Tokyo every now and then. The boy, turns out to be the other main character. This sounds like the basic story, in which our lead learns, that 'every place is beautiful, but home is still best' or that everybody has troubles in their life, no matter where they come from. The set up definitely has some potential, since the main characters parallel each other in an interesting way and they're pretty well characterized. But that doesn't turn out to be the case with 'Your Name'. The writer was far more ambitious than to just recycle the classic body switch plot. About halfway the movie switches into a pretty convoluted romance story, that just doesn't work, because the whole second half is built around wanting to give the audience the 'feels'. Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance or a good tragedy as much as anyone else, but if it all feels as contrived and transparent as in this movie's case, I won't be able to jump on the feel train. The climax was a pretty interesting idea, but was pretty inconsistently build up, where things worked out way too conveniently to be believable.Characters: I've already addressed it in the previous section, that I found the characterization of the characters pretty good. With the exception of the self-absorbed and ambitious father almost all felt pretty lively. Unfortunately characters can at time's be only as good as the plot allows them to be. This shows especially with the side characters, who at times just conveniently join into the plot, even if it doesn't make much sense. Same goes for our leads, they're pretty fun at first, but as soon as the plot starts becoming contrived and convoluted, I no longer found them as likable.Art: The art and animation were pretty good, but it was pretty standard in terms of style.Sound: Just like the plot the sound was also heavy into making you feel stuff and to be fair it did resonate with me somewhat. Interestingly there were a lot of pop songs instead of the more typical choice of instrumentals. Plot: 50% (4/10) Characters: 30% (6/10) Art: 10% (8/10) Soundtrack: 10% (8/10)Score: 5/10",5,28,68,22 September 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," It's what it is
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first in a line of probably many Star Wars spin off movies, that the people don't really need, but still somehow want. With that being said it's absolutely going the same way as the Marvel cinematic universe and taking something with a large fan base, then hiring competent enough writers, that can write around the franchises core and come up with a product, that doesn't seem like complete fan pandering shlock. None of the movies of such calibre are really worth a spot in a movie canon, but since all entertainment is audience pandering to some degree, we might as well look at it and evaluate it's worth. With that out of the way; Rogue One is fine overall. The movie is kind of pointless. We know it's outcome and where the story goes afterwards and you can easily predict the outcome. It's up to you to decide, whether you'll just take the information you get in 'A New Hope' or whether you'd rather have this 2 hour movie do that for you. By taking the long road, you get a cast of characters, that while interesting on paper, still lack some interaction and chemistry for it to eventually lead into a satisfying climax, a plot that doesn't feel like rehashing the originals, some of the original's style of immersive world to get surrounded by, some good action scenes, bunch of cameos, you might have wanted or maybe didn't and the obvious fan service, that matters the most to some; Darth Vader. If that's the stuff, you'd want to spend your 2 hours of free time on, then you might just have a blast with it.",6,3,8,17 December 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Review: X-Men: Apocalypse
","'At Least We Can All Agree The Third One Is Always The Worst'Interestingly this quote from the movie, that's hardly connected to anything plot related seems to have turned out to be a self fulfilling prophecy, which is a shame, because this movie had potential to be the climax of the (at this point) trilogy. All the pieces seemed to have been placed quite neatly for it to work. Unfortunately it didn't. The movie is especially weak in it's early phases. While the first scene works decently as an exposition to who the films antagonist is going to be, the next couple of scenes slow down the pace, giving us introductory scenes to 'new' characters. This could have been fine, had the characters been interesting. But they weren't. Luckily the movie has McAvoy, who even 3 movies in, is still the highlight of the series, due to the witty personality of his character (Charles Xavier). As for the other main character of this series (Magneto); this movie gives him a new start, but only as a setup for his involvement in the conflict, that is about to unfold. Unfortunately his character arc is just mashed into the large multi-character story line and therefore fails to peak the interest it's intending to catch. Another character worth mentioning is Quicksilver, who can best be described as a big convenience for the plot progressing into the direction the authors want to. This may sound like a negative thing, but something about Evan Peter's character just made me swallow it and go along with it. As for the antagonist; while not necessarily well written, I do feel like praising Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Apocalypse. The plot is for the most part character driven, which could go either way. In this case it didn't work out best, because the conflicts of the characters felt like something, that had been previously done already and some of the highlighted characters lacked the screen time to get an actually interesting characterization and development. Another aspect of the plot is the mutants using their powers to their advantage, which results in funny comic relief and entertaining battles. Due to this I actually felt the movie picking itself up towards the end, I was however displeased with the resolution of the conflict and it's aftermath. Overally the film is entertaining and ignoring the character introduction scenes, I wasn't bored during it's run time. That however does not mean it doesn't have it's fair share of problems.",5,5,14,21 May 2016
Warcraft," It does the games justice
","Making a movie based on a video game is a pretty bold move, because a lot can go wrong. A game's success can trigger movie makers to create half-assed products, that only serve cash grabbing and on the other side games tend to lack enough substance to make good movies. Luckily for Warcraft the latter isn't it's case and given to the right director and writers it can become quite a quality product. Also luckily for the fans, that's exactly what happened. First of all the movie absolutely achieved to immerse me in it's fantasy world. The presentation was beautiful and fitting to it's source material. It also deserves praise for it's great CGI (which happens rarely). When battles happened I genuinely felt excited. Compared to the Hobbit trilogy (as much as I dislike to bash on one of my favourite movie makers) they didn't feel like over the top CGI-dance routines. They had risk and intensity. Though I must admit, that a certain character did have a bit too much plot armor. As far as the story goes; it was overall interesting. I enjoyed the double perspective and world building elements. There were however problems in the plot transitioning. The exposition and early phases of the movie are quite lacking. It's all too fast paced and certain points, that should have been explained more thoroughly earlier only got to me after they kept bringing them up as the plot progressed. The acting was pretty good and you could sense some dedication within the portrayals of the characters. While the story was not too heavily character driven, they did deliver in being somewhat interesting to stick around with. Warcraft may not be the best fantasy film that came out, it however knows what it wants to be and gives it's fans, what they wanted to see. If you're not a Warcraft fan, you will likely have some trouble immersing yourself in this world at the get go, maybe it won't happen at all, but even then I find you could get some fun out of the impressive (while cartoon-y) CGI and the exciting action scenes.",6,12,22,26 May 2016
