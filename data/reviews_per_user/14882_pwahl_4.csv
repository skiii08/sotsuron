Ali," disappointing
","I'm a big Michael Mann fan, had anyone else directed this not even sure I would have gone to see it.  But, I don't think he succeeded with this one. Maybe Ali is just to familiar to me, but I kept seeing Will Smith playing Ali, not Ali himself.  I also thought he looked a bit small, did not have the more physically imposing presence that Ali had.Regarding the story, the final fight with Foreman was dealt with in a much better manner in the documentary 'When We Were Kings', so I found that segment already familiar and disappointing.  The movie never really gave me a sense of why he became such a popular figure, his rise to world wide fame is something the movie did not attempt to deal with.  Also an odd flow to the movie, little narrative, I didn't even know what city Ali lived in until he was introduced as the Louisville slugger, the end of his first marriage dealt with in a minute or so, and his appeal to his jail sentence dealt with only peripherally, no sense of how long that went on or how he ultimately won an 8-0 victory in the Supreme Court (as an aside, there are 9 justices, wonder what happened to number 9).",5,0,0,13 February 2002
We Were Soldiers," Excellent
","Excellent movie I thought, better than Black Hawk Down - better setup, more context.  A few things I have read about this movie - Galloway and Moore would not sell the story to Hollywood for quite a while, they wanted to be sure the story was treated with the proper respect, not turned into an anti-war screed, so they only sold the rights to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson when they were convinced the story would be told accurately.  The dialog is what was actually said, those who call it a cliche, what should they have done, change it to reflect someone elses idea of what would sound realistic?  The movie is really about the code of honor among the men, the sacrafice they made, it makes no judgement about the merits of the war, those that complain about that definitely miss the point.  And of course, its about the American side, yes it treats American deaths with more feeling than NV deaths.  But there is some view of the other side, presented in a balanced manner.  Good job by Gibson, probably helps that he played a compelling character, and nice supporting role for Sam Eliot.  8/10",8,1,2,9 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Disappointing
","I found this to be a fairly bland and disappointing movie.  Nice set design, some very clever and creative effects and settings.  But, once you get past that, there are several problems.  First, there isn't any chemistry between the Portman character and Skywalker, who I found rather creepy, not sympathetic, and the dialogue between them is trite and their scenes together quickly became tiresome.  Also, I found the transitions between some scenes to be rather jarring, as though some intervening scenes might have been cut out in the editing process.  And the actions scenes feel rushed, just some staged set pieces with no build up, so no tension in them. I can't help but compare the very busy and noisy but uninvolving action scenes here with someone who knows how to stage a scene, like Michael Mann in Mohicans and Heat. Rating, 5/10",5,0,1,23 October 2002
Armageddon," This movie is the worst
","An exercise in excess. Everything is overblown and overdone. The music is too much, the acting is too much, the editing is too much. Why show a scene with only one or two shots when you can have, oh, about 45 cuts in a minute, and practically all of it shot as closeups. Layer overblown music on top of that and have everyone yelling at everyone else, everyone acting full blast. Add in a some overblown emotional scenes that are there as some attempt to fill in the story. Billy Bob is about the only guy who somehow remains slightly above the hackneyed level of the script. And of course you don't have sound in a vacuum, but I suppose someone thought incessant sound added to the (nonexistent) excitement.",3,1,3,18 May 2006
