Angels & Demons," coincidence, luck and nonsense
",I watched the film after the trip to Italy. Very nice to see the historical sites again. But the movie isn't good. The bad guy made a very smart plan. Luck always helps the bad guy. But the villain is caught in a very simple way in the final. Very ridiculous.,4,0,0,26 December 2019
First Man," Boring movie

The Irishman," 'De niro' is too old for this role.
","'De niro' is too old for this role. I also liked the film except this subject. Three hours go by so fast. It looks like a 'good fellas'. If I need to address the famous debate. 'Marvel movies, of course, cinema. But superficial and bad cinema.",8,1,4,17 December 2019

Ready Player One," This is the artist
","Spielberg is over 70 years old. He has done film about computer games and
He understood that young generation better than me. hey logically put the classic scenes of cinema history into the film. They criticized capitalism.

The Lost City of Z," It was named in the best movie listings But...
","I saw it as one of your best movies. I think it's a little overrated. It's a movie over the standard, but it's not an unforgettable job. Adapted from a true story. Describes the main character's passions and how this affection affects his private life.",7,1,2,2 February 2018

The White Ribbon," why is there nazism?
","The film is a bit weaker than Haneke's other films. But not bad. But he does not achieve exactly what he wants to do. How did Nazism come from? A town explains this.

Call Me by Your Name," standard summer love film
","The film is a standard summer love film. But when lovers are gay, it's a tough job.

Gran Torino," film is a little silly
","I like films of clint eastwood. This movie is also nice. Story is good about die and old age. Suicide is unnecessary, The police have already arrested the gang. There are rape, heavy artillery. If the witnesses were afraid, they'd be scared in the finals.",6,1,3,20 November 2018

Logan," not consistent but beautiful
","I like the x-men series. This is one of the coolest movies ever. This is one of the beautiful films of the x-men series. But inconsistent. Because the story is going on in 2029.

Marriage Story," Don't get married
","It's a movie about the divorce process, it has a plain narrative. For you, the most important event of your life is a routine statistic for lawyers. The weird thing is, the lawyers who stir up the bad stuff are always right. When you watch, you're afraid of marriage and divorce. That might be the point of the film. :)",7,4,5,17 December 2019
