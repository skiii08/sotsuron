Scarface," Fantastic movie, a real classic
","This movie includes everything you can ever want from a movie; the action, the thrill and suspense, the love story, humor, the complete crack of a seemingly invincible character, and it got Al Pacino! I can't count the times I've seen this movie, tonight 'i'm reloaded' and I'm going to watch it again with my friends, while we are toasting for Tony Montana life and downfall. This is a real classic, in the same class as De Palma and Pacinos 'Carlito's Way' (which it's later prequel 'Rise to Power' should be avoided) and 'The Usual Suspects'. Even if Tony is a bad guy, the character is so well done, and you end up cheering him through the movie. And when Tony ends Manny's life after the rough road they've climbed together throughout the movie, it's tough holding the tears back. This one has got it all. If you haven't seen it, shame on you. If you have seen it, see it again. This is a movie which should have a place in everyones DVD-shelf.",10,0,1,22 September 2006
Captain Phillips," The worst movie this year
","I really hated this movie. Give me my money back, please! From the start to the end, this was awful. Although, some of Hanks' previous movies are even worse, for instance The Da Vinci Code. The love-story was unbelievable. Who would love Tom Hanks' (character?) The part with the goat was also totally out of place. I mean, I like goats in most movies, but this just felt wrong. I really hope they don't make a sequel for this. His superpowers are gone, he is a normal guy now. So just let it be. The best scene in the movie was the end credits. I really enjoyed them, some of the best end credits in a long time. And why was the movie so long? It felt like I actually went on an airplane, and travelled around the world. The movie should have been set on a spaceship. That would have cut the travel and runtime considerably, and the movie into a short-film. And why couldn't the terrorists be white? I found this movie pretty offensive.",1,4,23,9 January 2014
