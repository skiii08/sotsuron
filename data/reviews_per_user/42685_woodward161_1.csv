Iron Man 3," Such a let down
","Let me start by saying, like most people have said before they rant: I am a HUGE marvel fan, and a HUGE RDJ fan. So if anything this review is positively bias more so than negatively.Ill start by pointing out the good things about the film briefly. Excellent CGI, good banter, and on the whole great acting by rdj, gweneth paltrow and don cheadle.Now the bad bit....the plot, honestly...what were marvel thinking?SPOILERS**1) Ruined the main protagonist. (Mandarin). 2) Unexplained anxiety attack thing? 3) The stupid sub plot with a random 9 year old kid? 4) The makeshift iron man gadgets made from tree decorations and gardening gloves etc? 5) The magic injection that heals people...yet also makes them turn into lava....and breath fire....only sometimes you die from it...but usually you don't... 6) The way they 'defeated' the bad guy like 5 times before finishing him with a hand blaster. 7) The fact that tony gets his arc reactor removed?! and destroys his suits? seriously, what is the point in that? He says he built them to protect pepper yet just throws them away after she nearly dies.... I really hope we see rdj in the avengers sequel. But i hope even more that they don't use the screenwriter or director from this first installment of phase two. Feel really let down and disappointed.",4,18,35,1 May 2013
