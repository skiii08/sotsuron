The Devil's Advocate," Behold, I sent you there, a sheep amidst the wolves
","Lets get things right and sparkling clear. The devil is not red, does not have horns and doesn't carry a pitchfork around. No-no-no, not so. Taylor Hackford's version of the devil is an omnipresent, omniscient Al Pacino with enough charisma to seduce a rock, enough malevolence to make the movie a very scary experience and enough humor to make you grin and even laugh. Keanu Reeves is at his best as Kevin Lomax and so is Charlize Theron as Kevin Lomax's troubled wife. The movie is long, but the two hours get by rather fast. The ending is...well, it's two endings in one. It seems that Hackford wanted to end his movie with a happy end and with a not so happy end at the same time (to please everybody in the audience, perhaps?). Otherwise , the whole movie is a thoroughly enjoyable experience, although it might leave the most sensible viewers a little uneasy.",9,1,1,23 August 1999
