Mission: Impossible III," An exhilarating film
","First of all let me begin by saying that, generally speaking, I have noticed that a series of films gets progressively worse as each film attempts to live up to the expectations of the first. There are of course many anomalies to this 'general' rule and this film is a perfect example. From the very first scene to the last (well not quite the last as the ending is maybe a little weak) the film delivers the non-stop action that is expected of it.The storyline was quite thin and stretched. There were some trademark twists and turns but again these are now expected and so loose some of their punch. The acting far surpasses the cheesy-ness of the second and Hoffman plays a great villain though I felt he could have had more screen time.One or two minor plot holes involving the hero/villain stance of one or two characters but other then that the story is followable, if a little thin. My main 'thing' with this film (bear in mind this has little to do with the success of the film) was that Michelle Monaghan looked too much like Katie Holmes which I thought (considering its tom cruise) was too weird to be a coincidence.In the general the film is great. It's full of mind blowing action scenes, gadgets, cars, guns and even Vatican City! The film seems more 'real' then the second and is definitely worthy of proceeding the first Mission Impossible.....Oh yeah and there's less of those cheesy love scenes that made the second annoying.",8,0,2,6 May 2006
