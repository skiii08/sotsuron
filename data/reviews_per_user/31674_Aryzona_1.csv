The Blair Witch Project," THE most boring film of the summer! Horrible, horrible, .....
","The endless leaves, the constant whining, the shaking camera, lack of plot or story....The audience (comprised mainly of high school and college age folk) booed at the end en masse. Deservedly so.  I though Lake Placid was terrible, so was the Haunting.  But this movie was really worse than the previous.  My friend and I were prepared to be scared.  We looked forward to being scared.  We weren't.  We were bored and disappointed and apparently so was the rest of the audience.  The preview trailer for Stigmata was scarier than this film.This film can never be in the same league as Psycho ( now that scared me and still does).  Unfortunately, the only professionals associated with this 'film' who did their job well were the publicists.  Kudos folks, you suckered us out of a total of $11.00 for something that isn't worth the price of a Blockbuster rental.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
