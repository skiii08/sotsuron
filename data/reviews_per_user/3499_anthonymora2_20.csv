Million Dollar Arm," Major Movie Review: Million Dollar Arm
","Has anyone seen Miracle? I'm not a hockey fan but that movie is so stuffed with fluffy, Disney inspiration and spirit that after watching it even I wanna throw on a couple of skates and ice-tackle some giant Russian dude. It was a great sports movie from The Mickey Mouse guys, MILLION DOLLAR ARM is the latest baseball movie from Disney starring Jon Hamm. Did this movie make me wanna pick up a glove and throw a no hitter or was it another clone off the Moneyball success train? Sports agent, J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) has a struggling agency that is hungry for some talent to represent. Their best prospect was an up-coming linebacker that jumped ship to a flashier agency. So in an act of desperation he takes on a job for a business investor looking to recruit some Asian talent for some Major League play. So, Bernstein decides to scout around 'the next great untapped market' for young baseball talent, India. In order to dig out the next Jeter, J.B. and his associates plan this talent competition, where the best hometown athlete would win $1 million and a chance to try out for a major league contract. It's during one of these stops that the crew discover these two young guys, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) who both have quite the pitching arm! Rinku has this weird, Swan Kick like pitch that had me ROLLIN'! So after seeing these kids' talent and picking up this hilarious little translator dude, the squad flies back to the states and it's up to J.B. to both get these kids to perfect their pitch for the pros and maybe improve his own personal way of living.Disney has always been pretty good when it comes to their live-action sports movies. The previously mentioned Miracle is a sports classic, even Invincible with Mark Wahlberg was a pretty good football movie. Million Dollar Arm is a welcomed addition to that fine group of movies, not the best but certainly entertaining. It plays everything pretty close to the formula that a majority of similar sports films follow, so don't be surprised if you can see where this story if going from the start. Thankfully, the strong familiarity of it all isn't too much of a burden as it's a very ewell acted and good looking movie.Jon Hamm is at his suave, best as J.B. Bernstein. His character has a lot of Jerry McGuire in him; he's a model dating, smooth talker that is on the edge when it comes to his career. But what makes his performance a plus here was how Jon Hamm brought out the likability and humanity of his character, which I didn't think I was gonna see. He wasn't Don Draper here. The two young actors who played the baseball hopefulls were also very good in their roles. Like with Jon Hamm's character, I was surprised with how the movie actually took the time to show some of the smaller, more tender character moments. Moments that made you care for the people on screen. Especially with the young Indian players! Alan Arkin is as enjoyable a screen presence as always, I didn't even know he was in the movie. Bill Paxton and Aasif Mandvi, who I always loved on The Daily Show, also had very good supporting roles. By the way, that's BACK-TO-BACK awesome Paxton flicks with this and my previous review of Edge of Tomorrow! It's great to see him in some good movies again.Disney is never one to spare any expense with their movies. The production and cinematography are top notch! The 2nd act that takes place across India, when they're recruiting guys, is awesome and authentic, taking us to multiple cities across the country. The film's soundtrack is also a pleasure to the senses. It's this awesome culture and genre blend just like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. There is no shortage of feel good vibes in this movie, or as I like to call it fluff or cheese. The script is soft and standard enough that it won't be as memorable or as sharp as Moneyball but it's got all the heart and baseball smarts to make for a sports movie that's never boring and actually, pretty touching.Sports fans and non-sports fans alike will find enough to enjoy this movie. It's an easy, feel-good watch with a great cast and some terrific production. Another win for the Disney Sports library. I say, 'IT'S WORTH A WATCH'.What about you guys? Have you seen Million Dollar Arm? What did you think? What's your favorite sports movie ever? Drop a comment and LET'S TALK MOVIES!",8,0,0,9 October 2014
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips is one of the most intense films I saw last year. Like Gravity, which premiered very close to this film actually, this thrilling drama shows the potential and very real dangers that come to these kind of occupations. Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Phillips, I've always been a huge fan of Hanks, and his performance in this film, particularly during the last like half hour, brought me near tears. You don't see Tom Hanks in this role, you see Richard Phillips, you believe his performance the entire way through. You felt his pain, fear, and anger in every scene. It really was a shame he didn't get an Oscar nom for the role in my honest opinion. Another plus was the performance of newcomer Barkhad Abdi, the head pirate, Muse. Most the people I know who have seen the movie kinda pushed aside his performance, but you gotta see that this man is NOT a pirate in real life, he's a professional actor. This is his first movie role, but every second he's on screen, you don't see an actor, you see a Somali pirate, who is both intimidating with his long glares, but at the same time can deliver a line like 'I've come too far, I can't give up.' with enough acting talent that you can see this is just a man who needs money to get by back home. Even the crew of the Alabama ship did great. You believed these men were just a boat crew in way over their heads, but through the chaos, kept straight heads and avoided making typical, stupid decisions that a lot of secondary characters seem to do in movies like this. Director Paul Greengrass is someone whose work I've always enjoyed, I even like Green Zone a bit. A lot of people give him crap for the shaky cam in his past works, which CAN take you out of some of the action scenes, but for the most part Captain Phillips is a movie is great to look at. Even in tight spot scenes like in the engine room or the lifeboat, you'd expect to see nothing but blurred images and hearing action. However, intense action parts are well directed enough to where you soak in every suspenseful second. The music is another plus for me, as is just the grand epicness of this film. I seen hundreds of explosions and car chases in movies, but the pirates attempt at boarding the Alabama and Tom Hanks firing off flares in an attempt to defend his fortress was one of the my favorite action sequences of 2013. Captain Phillips also has one of the most thrilling ending in all of film, I couldn't breathe, I was sweaty, and literally jumped up during my first even second viewing. The only real complaint with this movie is that, at 134 minutes long, it felt a bit longer than it is, but a lot of it is just build up to the film's amazing climax. So I can't really complain. Captain Phillips is a film that is definitely worth a viewing, with excellent acting, some great directing and just being an all out thrill ride. I give it an A.",9,0,1,26 January 2014
Lone Survivor," I survived Lone Survivor
","Let me start this review by saying, I have nothing but respect for all the men and women fighting for our freedom. Without these heroes, I couldn't be typing up this review. Thank you all for your service. Lone Survivor! Directed by Peter Berg, this movie follows a small squad of super elite, awesome soldiers who are on a mission to either kill or bag a ruthless Taliban leader. However, their mission quickly becomes compromised and all hell breaks loose as our four heroes try to fend off an army of Taliban grunts. I REALLY loved this movie, I haven't seen a more brutal, intense, testosterone filled movie this good in a while. What makes the movie so suspenseful doesn't only come from the incredible shoot outs that take place, but also because you really get involved with the characters in the movie. The opening montage of the training these guys go through perfectly set the tone of the movie. The action is shockingly intense, and the directing really puts you in the middle of these battles. I thought the performances were all around really good, it was cool seeing Emile Hirsch in a good movie again. Ben Foster and Mark Wahlberg were typically good, but it was Taylor Kitsch (Mr. John Carter of Mars)that surprised me with his chops. His character was very likable, as was all the other characters. The main villain doesn't get to much screen time, but even then you knew and felt this guy had to go down. When an action movie THIS intense, gives us great relatable characters to go on this journey with it makes for a great watch. The settings, cinematography, sound effects, and STUNT WORK are all amazing. There's a scene where characters are just rolling down a cliff to escape harm and it's PAINFUL to watch! You feel every bone crack. I can't find a fault here, the movies about 2 hours and you can NOT tell, it hits you with some character development and just exlodes for the next hour and a half without a moment to catch your breath. This is an exceptional film that I really adore. I give this movie my highest recommendation, buy this blu-ray!",Null,0,1,25 June 2014
Akira," Akira Review
","So after what I consider a good start to my anime review series, I thought a good follow up to my review of ATTACK ON TITAN, which is probably one of the most popular new animes out today, would be a review for AKIRA, probably the most popular and acclaimed anime of ALL TIME! AKIRA is set in the dystopian future of Tokyo, Japan in the year 2019. Tetsuo and Kaneda are the characters we start with and they're these young, motorcycle riding hoodlums that drive around the neon lit streets just living their young, motorcycle riding hoodlum lives. During a seemingly everyday gang fight, Tetsuo gets in a crash involving a mysterious, wrinkled child. The government comes flying in on choppers and scoop up the kid and Tetsuo and take them away.After the abduction, Kaneda decides it's up to him to get back his friend with the help of Kei, a kick ass anti-government chick that is also involved with the mysterious kid, however government cover ups and secrets are discovered along the way and leads to a mind blowing amount of chaos and destruction. The plot of Akira is one that demands your full attention and patience.By that, I don't mean it doesn't make sense or is boring.If anything, the script and story have a surprising amount of depth and covers many themes,which honestly threw me off guard.Themes like religion,politics,even the theme of having power.HOWEVER, as much as I was engrossed and in love with the movie's story, I can't see where non casual anime watchers can get into something this...ALL OVER THE PLACE, for lack of better words.If I showed my mom Akira, she'd be scared off as soon as a she saw a grey child witnessing a German shepard dog getting face shot.That doesn't mean the story telling is all that perfect though, there were some certain characters that take forever to really get behind.A big majority of the first half,I DID have trouble figuring each character out and their motives and purpose.Thankfully the story DOES get into each character further into the run time, but it takes a while for certain characters to flush out.That problem isn't there for the two main characters of Tetsuo and Kaneda.The two have this real bond and brotherhood and it really carries the story along.A thing I did find odd and never really thought of was how a lot of the movies promotional art and DVD covers, heavily show the character of Kaneda.While he IS a major character in the movie, there are so many other people like Ryu,The Colonel(personal fav),and of course Tetsuo that are just as important. The beauty of the film's animation is damn mear perfect!Pixar and Dreamworks have given us pretty films of recently but this was made back in 1988.That means HAND DRAWN ANIMATION!There is not one moment that doesn't look absolutely gorgeous.Backgrounds and settings with constant ruins and destruction are beautifully detailed and character models are some of the best I've seen in any anime.Usually in anime, no matter how good it is, the animation can get pretty stiff and jittery at times.Akira has constantly fluid and crisp animation that keeps you glued to EVERY frame.It still blows my mind when I think of just how much care the artists behind the scenes put into this movie. The influence of this movie, like its animation, is also very strong.If I told you this anime influenced today's blockbusters like The Matrix and Chronicle, you'd probably can see why with the highly stylized action and effects it uses.You can also see where Akira was influenced by other classic sci-fi movies like Blade Runner with the bright, hypnotic city skylines. Akira is an animation lover's anime; it's shockingly nice to look at, even at it's more twisted and trippy moments.The story is both epic and deep while also giving us likable lead characters to get behind. If you're not into Anime I highly suggest A RENTAL AT LEAST. It's just a beautifully made anime that deserves a watch but for fans and true animation/film lovers I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUT IT!",10,0,3,22 September 2014

Apocalypse Now," Major Movie Review: Apocalypse Now
","I love reviewing older, classic films. When I watch a really great movie that was made in the 70's or some bygone decade, I get that tingle in my cinephilic being that I just gotta discuss it or bring it up to a friend of mine who may have never even heard of the movie! APOCALYPSE NOW, is a film like THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA; it's highly acclaimed by nearly every movie lover out there. So it'd be blasphemous for me NOT to talk about this movie and perhaps even introduce the movie to younger cinephiles that haven't seen anything beyond what's been released during their recent lifetime. So is APOCALYPSE NOW, really a great piece of art or a long, boring war movie?MARTIN SHEEN is Special Operations Vet., Captain Ben Willard, a troubled American soldier who is called back to duty during the Vietnam War. His mission is to track down and kill a renegade, Col. Walter E. Kurtz (the great MARLON BRANDO), who has made himself something of a god deep, in the jungles of Cambodia and now controls a small army of natives that obey his every attack and command. To get there, Captain Willard, travels by riverboat up the Nung River which is crawling with Viet Cong and we, as an audience, take this journey with him and meet a plethora of characters that include an extremely young LAURENCE FISHBURNE, ROBERT DUVALL as the darkly comical Kilgore, and DENNIS HOPPER as a tripped out photo journalist who has just been in a war torn jungle too long.For my full, in depth review of APOCALYPSE NOW, please head over to my Tumblr.

Divergent," Divergent Review
","So 2014 has really been the year for strong woman characters in movies.Scarlet brought us Black Widow and Lucy,Emily Blunt kicks ass in Edge of Tomorrow,Maleficent freakin dominated the theatres!That brings me to Divergent.The latest teen novel to movie adaption that is thankfully more Hunger Games than Twilight.Shailene Woodley plays Tris.A young woman living in some sort of futuristic ruin of Chicago that has these virtue based groups of people.When Tris finds out shes been titled Divergent she also stumbles upon an evil plot to take out all Divergents.Chaos and rebellion ensue and we get what is a total set up to a saga.Ill explain in a bit.Ms.Woodley really owns her role.I admit it took me a minute to really get behind her character at first but as she gets stronger and progresses so does you connection with her.Like Katniss is Hunger Games,Tris is another great big screen,female badass.Theo James does alright as Four.He's advertised as a love interest but in the end his relationship with Tris I ended up really liking their chemistry.Sure there's a smidge of romance but the film focuses more on the character of Tris and the adventure that the movie tells.The story by the way is OK.It had a bit of a slow build for me but once I learned more about how civilization is run in this universe and why certain events were happening I got more into the story.Some of the dialog was pretty weak though and you can definitely tell its a movie working on a smaller budget than say The Hunger Games movies.There are still some really good parts in this movie.Some of the action was shot rather well and good character development leads to some pretty intense moments like when two well liked characters are hurting each other.This movie is definitely setting up a sequel and future films which kinda drags the movie down but also leaves me interested in where this series goes.It lacks the sheer suspense and scope of Hunger Games but thankfully puts character and story before a suffocating love story and countless shirt ripping scenes.If you're a fan I RECOMMEND A PURCHASE. For casual movie watchers ITS WORTH A RENTAL! 7/10",6,0,1,22 September 2014
The Lego Movie," The Lego Movie is (Yes) ....Awesome
","2014 is that rare year where Pixar and Disney don't release a new film. While that makes me sad, I have a theory that the other studios decided, 'hey let's put out our best films'. So now we have Dragons 2 and The Lego Movie dominating our screens. In The Lego Movie, we follow Emmet, a completely plain Lego construction worker living his day to day life by the rules. That is, until he get's involved in this grand quest with a fellowship of Lego Warriors to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. We've all seen this plot before, and this movie knows it. I LOVE this film, it's so smartly written and full of laughs. It feels like watching a really great Disney movie. You never have that feeling of 'blah been there done that' and thats because the movie has all these pop culture references, breathtaking animation, and there's plenty of humor for us grown folk. The cast is made up of some pretty well known names; Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, and Will Arnett are a few, but it was Morgan Freeman and Liam freaking Neeson that show some great voice acting skills. As I said, the animation is mind blowing but beautiful to look at honestly. Believe me when I say EVERYTHING, even the explosions are made of Legos! If you couldn't tell by now, I was pretty amazed by this movie. The ending, was what made this a great animation movie. It hit me hard and surprised me. Kids will love it, adults will have a good time too. This is definitely worth a purchase, and I didn't even get into how awesome Batman is in this one. Awesome little Star Wars collab in this one.",8,0,2,25 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men Days of Future Past
","Talk about a rise and fall and rebirth of a franchise. If you're around my age than the big superhero franchises that we soaked in were the Raimi's Spider-Man films, Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and of course the X-Men movies. Overall, I can honestly say that I really love this series. Origins: Wolverine, is certainly a low point and while The Last Stand was no where near the awesomeness and greatness that was Bryan Singer's first 2 films, it's still a fairly entertaining action movie. First Class was (before yesterday) my favorite X-Men movie, and even THE Wolverine was an awesome and gritty and much needed different take on an X-Men story. I literally grew up with this movie franchise, so I guess you can say I was extremely hyped when I sat down in the theater for DOFP.You start off with a Terminator like intro, the first 10 minutes of this movie had some of the strongest and haunting scenes I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Humans AND mutants are on a losing side of a tragic war against the genocidal, Sentinels. A group of X-Men, led by Patrick Stewart's, Prof. X and Ian McKellen's, Magneto. They have a last hope idea of sending someone back to the point in time, where these Sentinel's were created. With his ability to heal and agelessness, Wolverine offers his services to travel back to 1972, to try to reunite the torn friendship between young Magneto and Prof. X, and band together to prevent this horrible war from happening.My god, what a rush this movie was. I don't think I had this sense of wonder watching a comic book movie since The Dark Knight Rises premiered. The eerie opening got me by surprise, but it worked. It perfectly showed us the audience, just how serious and catastrophic this battle with The Sentinels is. So from the start I'm hooked, then we get into this crazy plan hatched up that sends Wolverine to the 70's and get a bit more lighter, but then we see James McAvoy in a terrific performance as young and troubled Charles Xavier, Jennifer Lawrence being as hot and more bad ass than ever as Mystique, and of course Michael Fassbender as the multi-layered Magneto. Everyone's performance in this movie was utilized so good. Oscar winner Halle Berry has minimal dialog, but her presence was felt, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, and Evan Peters all aren't front and center a lot, but they give it their all every minute they're on screen, which makes the dramatic tension so powerful especially when you see certain characters die or get injured. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine as usual, but in a different way, as opposed to past films. Here, Wolverine is a much more centered guy, who really wants to help everyone. He even agrees to think happy thoughts to keep his mind from bursting by traveling through space-time. You would think a movie THIS packed with story, characters, and action, that'd the movie would get lost and tumble over it's own weight and I can't tell you happy I am that it doesn't. You're never once lost as to what's going on, what needs to be done, and how everything got to where it is. The story is played out rather well. Each character and actor has the perfect amount of screen time for what it is their character's are needed for. Quicksilver is a perfect example, he stole every scene he was in, and while he's here and gone pretty swiftly, it gives other more important characters their time to shine. You gotta give it up to the writers and the absolutely terrific direction of Mr. Bryan Singer. Just hearing the X-Men theme song playing during the begging made my eyes tear, this movie really brought the X-Men back to greatness. The special effects were spot on, my favorite scene even outshining the big stadium scene was, Quicksilver's kitchen run. The combination of music, humor, effects, and practical effects worked to summer blockbuster perfection. The design on the Sentinel's were OK, I wasn't blown away by them as they reminded me a lot of the giant robot guard from the first Thor movie. The setting of 1970's Washington makes for some pretty nice looking sets and sequences and the future scenes were awesome. The action is filmed so well and the powers of the mutants make the action just the kind of jaw dropping eye candy I've been wanting. This is one of the best movie I've seen all year, it may have even beaten out Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my favorite comic book movie of the year. The action, acting, and story are exceeded my expectations. I really believe the hype and I see why people are rushing back for another viewing, this is a fantastic movie and I give it my highest recommendation. This movie was a Cineadventure.",8,17,24,2 June 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Major Movie Review: The Fault in our Stars
","Aww look at that! Aside from movies about graphic sex addiction and brutal R-rated revenge tales involving hammering FOOLS through the crown of their skulls, I make room for the softer side. The ones that might just make you feel all fuzzy inside and perhaps call for a box of tissues. I love me a good tear jerker is what I'm saying, and there wasn't a bigger waterworks show this year than the ones that happened at theatres showing THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. Did I crack and cry glorious man tears?Hazel Grace Lancaster (SHAILENE WOODLEY) is a young woman who has terminal lung cancer. She carries a oxygen tank around with her EVERYWHERE she goes. Yet, there's so much more to her: she's really sophisticated, she has a wit to her, plus she's really pretty. Despite this fatal 'journey' she finds ways to get the most out of the life she has left. After much insistence from her mother (LAURA DERN) Hazel Grace goes to a cancer support group meeting. There she meets, Augustus Waters (ANSEL ELGORT or as I now call him 'the guy your girlfriend now wants), he is also an ex-cancer patient who unfortunately lost his leg to his sickness. There meeting sparks a romance that we the audience watch and grow on and I'll leave it at that because I want first time viewers to really soak in how this romance is told.Please check out my full review of THE FAULT IN OUR STARS on my Tumblr, link to that is in my InstaBio and let me know what you think.What about you guys?

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Dragons rule the land of animation
","You can have your Despicable Mes and Ice Ages and Cars movies, because the Dragons movies are the best animated films in the last 10 years! Dragons 2 (as I'm forever calling it) takes place five years after the event of the original film. So SPOILER ALERT for those sad sacks who haven't seen it. The good viking folk of Berk, have found peace with the once hated dragons and now share their island home with the beasts as pets. Hiccup and Toothless have become quite the adventuring duo as they fly around discovering new lands and dragon species. However, after hearing of an evil bastard named Drago and his dragon army causing chaos to everything in sight, Hiccup, with the help of his long lost mother, unite to keep the peace. I have no shame in starting by saying this is the best animated movie since Toy Story 3! Hell, it might be the best MOVIE of the year so far. That's not exaggeration yall. The drama, the emotion, even the action is handled extremely well for a 'kids movie'. Sure, you get your occasional funny moment or cute/cool dragon moment, but there is certainly more than enough appeal for us grown peoples. This movie hits HARD in the emotional area. Character animations and the landscapes are animated gorgeously; you can mistake a big chunk of this movie for live action. And the music by, John Powell, good lord! There's a certain scene with Hiccup and his mother flying around together and the music beautifully sets the tone, #notgonnalie it choked me up. Yes, this movie got to me. You also get great epic scores during the awesome action sequences. The voice acting is top notch all around, Djimon Hounsou was my personal favorite as the villain. Dreamworks pulled a winner, this is quite possibly surpassing X-Men as top 2014 movie so far. I of course give this movie my highest recommendation, it's a must see.",9,3,8,25 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Glad I checked into The Grand Budapest
","Wes Anderson is really consistent with crafting extremely well-made films. His awesome attention to detail and how he shoots his movies won me over with Moonrise and now, with, GBH I'm convinced Wes Anderson is one of the best, original directors we have today. There's a lot going on in this movie: A girl is visiting a memorial and reading a book by a Nameless Author. Meanwhile, the Author narrates this book for us about a lonely hotel owner who then tells the Author a story about his start as a young Lobby Boy being trained by the then hotel concierge. There's a painting theft, a ski chase, a great and suspenseful museum foot chase. This movie is on through the entire time. When it's not giving you a scene filled with great dialog from it's wonderful cast, you're admiring the typically beautiful set design. The script does a great job of using each setting in the movie and throwing in some surprisingly intense sequences. That museum scene is my favorite and there's awesomely shot shootout at the end that kind acts as a cherry on top of the sundae. The dream team cast is near perfect, as with all Wes Anderson movies. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant and carries the movie IMO, any man that can go from the evil Dark Lord to leading a comedy and nailing it is aces in my book. There's a lot of cool smaller roles, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum stand out. Again this film is technically flawless as well. The cinematography and music fit well and direction is perfect. I easily recommend a purchase for Wes Anderson and film fans. Casual movie goers might enjoy a rental.",9,4,7,25 June 2014
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting Review
","Every now and then I like to step away from reviewing a new theatrical or Blu-ray release and talk about movies that have already been out for some time now.I,as I'm sure the rest of the world,am still deeply hurt to hear about the tragic death of Robin Williams.So I wanna share my opinions on one of his most celebrated movies and movie roles in Good Will Hunting. William Hunting is a young,South Boston raised punk who works as a janitor at M.I.T.Ironically,despite being 'just a janitor',Will can solve math equations that baffle even the school's top professors.After anonymously solving a nearly impossible math problem posted in the school halls,he gets the attention of one of the school math professors. With the teachings of Prof. Lamdeau,played by Skarsgard,and regular therapy visits with a community college psychology professor,Will gets the opportunity to really show just what his young brain is capable of while also finding a person he can open up and connect to in, Dr. Sean Macguire played flawlessly by the late,Robin Williams. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won Oscars for their screenplay of this movie back when it released and believe me when I say that this movie's script is one of the best in film in my opinion.I know that's a stretch but every character conversation,no matter what the mood of the scene,is filled with interesting and important dialog.I literally won't watch this movie with out subtitles just because I don't wanna risk missing an important piece of info or some character development.There are scenes in this movie that can bring me tears with either sadness or hilarity,this is definitely a layered movie.All this makes the story that much more believable and that of course makes for extremely likable and developed characters.Seriously even minor characters have their moments throughout. With these great characters,you definitely get great performances.Matt Damon is as good as I've ever seen him,he has these one takes where he goes on and on spewing out all this mind numbing but intriguing dialog.Ben Affleck is in this one,however he really plays the secondary character here.That doesn't mean he doesn't get a few good scenes here and there,I actually liked his character as well.Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard both give really good supporting performances as well.As for Mr.Williams,I really don't have to say anything.What more need be said by now,you know? His performance in this movie puts you through so many different emotions as does his character and it works SO effectively,he's perfect! The music by Danny Elfman is subtle but really kicks when it has to and the cinematography is also actually very good after I rewatched this on Blu-ray.Gus Van Sant may not be a houshold name but he really has this way of making the movie seem almost like a documentary sometimes,he brings realism to his films and a lot of welcomed depth to his characters. With this review I'd like to say one last goodbye to my childhood hero,Robin Williams and praise his performance as well as this film that still gets me Every time!You can call it a sympathy rating but I cant help but give this movie a perfect 10/10 because its MY review and despite the circumstances,this is really a GREAT film and I love it.Of course I give GOOD WILL HUNTING MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUY THIS MOVIE!",9,1,5,22 September 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
","This movie has a %47 percentage rating on Rotten Tomatoes. For the life of me I can't figure out why. Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I thought this movie was pretty freaking good.Who is Walter Mitty? For the entire 114 minute length, I saw me. The average Joe among average Joes. Living in a world a bit too slow and small compared to the flashy universe that is his mind. The mind, where one minute I'm a surfboarding heartthrob ripping tidal wives the size of skyscrapers, caused by a storm of asteroids. Then the next, I'm a awesome super hero, stopping a Michael Mann style bank heist. It's an awesome idea to see an everyday, day dreamer go out and live a fantasy and take on an adventure. Some of the 'zone outs' shown in the film are hit and miss, but I think the biggest plus I can give this movie, other than how much I saw myself in the title character's position, is the look of the movie. The set design's in the Life offices, to the gorgeous landscapes of Greenland and Iceland. Ben Stiller, knows how to make a good looking movie, we have further proof with Tropic Thunder. The scene parodying Benjamin Button, was comedy gold. Unfortunately, I don't think a lot of people got it at first. The movie isn't overly comical like some of Stiller's other films, but it really is a nice change of pace for Mr. Stiller, even Kristen Wiig was better than normal with her performance. Some of the more dramatic elements didn't work with me as much as I think the script wanted, the random moment with an ex-boyfriend in the film seemed pretty pointless and the scenes with Walter's family are ironically the least effective when it comes to creating any sense of connection with the characters. Adam's Scott's character was also a pretty big negative. He was such a unnecessarily rude, and dreadful character. I understand he's the closest thing to a 'villain' the movie has, but every scene he was on, I just wanted to light his horrible looking beard on fire.I still had a blast with this movie, it was almost a relaxing kind of roller coaster. Ben Stiller is, surprisingly, an actor/director whose future projects I will eagerly awaiting, he hasn't disappointed me yet.",8,1,2,16 April 2014
22 Jump Street," 22 Jump Street Review
","You ever watch a sequel to a movie, and the sequel was pretty much the same thing as the original with nothing new to give our money's worth? Well , 22 Jump Street both is and spoofs the idea of that last sentence... and it kills! So we pick up again with Schmidt and Jenko (Hill and Tatum) in the middle of a drug bust. The two blow it, and after being told that maybe they should 'just do what you did last time' are thrown right back into the same exact situation that they were put into in the original movie 2 years ago. The situation, of course, to go undercover and find who's selling a new drug to the local student body. Only NOW, instead of high school misshaps, we get some college chaos! The thing that I liked most about 22 JS is that it's a fun movie and doesn't take itself seriously, AT ALL! People will say, 'waah but it's the SAME movie!' and the movie will spit back in your face 'we know stupid', almost literally in some scenes. Like I said guys, it's more than less the same movie we got back in 2012, so the story gets 0 points for any originality. But the comedy makes this movie feel fresh and always coming at you. That's props to the group of writers behind the script. You get a lot of good gut hurting moments where you're laughing hard, but their are maybe two scenes that had me like 'okay this joke is stale'. The roommate who kept calling Jonah Hill old needed to delete from my sight. Another strong point that makes this a great comedy is the chemistry between the star duo. You just wanna hang out with these two dudes, their both hilarious in their roles. Jonah Hill is funny as always, Channing Tatum is someone I'm getting to like more and more but it's Ice Cube ladies and gentlemen that steals #themothafuckinshow. The dinner buffet scene is GOLD! Or should I say ICE COLD ðŸ˜‰. Again there were a few jokes that got boring after too many blows and the villains in this movie were't as enjoyable as the ones in the first, but this is a really funny comedy action buddy flick. Stay tuned for an awesome end credits that makes the movie! I recommend you definitely buy it on Blu- ray!",8,9,20,22 September 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","So to kick off the much anticipated summer movie season, Spidey swings back around for his 5th theatrical release in the last 15 years. So this time around, Peter Parker is on the cusp of figuring out why his parents left him all those years back, meanwhile, his relationship with Gwen Stacey is shaky and he has to decide whether it's safest to break it off or continue on with her. ALSO, Jamie Foxx plays Electro, the statically charged new villain who is causing mayhem AND things with the Osborn family and Oscorp are taking an insane toll, physically and emotionally, for Harry Osborn. There is A LOT going on in this movie, but is it good? Well it's definitely not bad, the best part of the movie is Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man; he can perfectly balance being a funny smart ass, and also tone a strong emotional side for the more dramatic moments. The chemistry between him and Emma Stone (also pretty good in the movie) is really good as well, you really believe the love between the two, even though it can get a bit much at times. Jamie Foxx as Electro was also really cool, which brings in mind the special effects and action scenes. The movie looks good and sounds great. Anything scored by Hans Zimmer is awesome. Now there are a good amount of problems; like I said before there is A LOT going on in this movie. It feels really condensed at times, mostly during the end, which was intense, but so much happened so fast. And the previews for this movie are the exact reason why I stay away from previews as much as possible, like %70 of the movie is in the trailers, that's not cool! The villains, other than Electro are seldom used, literally. This is obviously a build up for part 3, so I'm not gonna whine too much, but there was still a cluttered feel to the movie. It's still very fun, with some really good acting, Dane DeHaan was gold. It's just as good as the first Amazing Spider-Man, but still not as good as Spider-Man 2 or other comic book movies.",5,1,5,4 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Galaxy Review
","Comic Con is still fresh in a lot of folks minds with SOO much huge news.So much so I was worried that everyone was kind of pushing the upcoming Guardians release to the side.Thankfully this past weekend showed that Guardians is here to stay.We start on Earth with a young Peter Quill aka Star-Lord who just tragically lost his mother. Fast forward to adulthood and Star-Lord is a Pop loving,one lining,likable space scavenger.After picking up a mysterious orb and getting the attention of our other Guardians and some space Hun named Ronan the Accusor,we set off on what I can only describe is a action packed,space roller coaster with never before seen worlds,strange alien life,and Merle Dixon looking like a hillbilly version of Night Crawler in X2(Hes really awesome in this movie by the way).If you're a fan of anything sci-fi you're gonna have at least a minuscule attraction to this latest Marvel beast.Chris Pratt is great as Star-Lord.Zoe Saldana is another addition to this years amazing roster of awesome female characters.Rocket Raccoon is the big money here and STEALS THE SHOW!The villain of Ronan was decent I thought but felt like filler for Thanos.This is why i was all for Disney taking over Marvel Stud.No expense is spared here with GORGEOUS effects and action sequences.There were a lot of good use of makeup and practical effects which always reminds me of Star Wars and thats always a good thing.There were a lot of decently filmed fight sequences that really looked good.The story isn't the most original however.The whole McGuffin driven plot is used over and over again in super hero movies but thankfully the writing,the great character development and the direction really make this a unique and refreshing experience for me considering how many superhero movies I watch.While it gets all the superhero movie standards no problem,again its the humor and lets not forget the incredible soundtrack that reserves this movie a spot in my top movies of the year list.This is everything I wanted it to be.Fun,hilarious,breathtakingly sharp and I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUY THIS MOVIE! 9/10",8,1,4,22 September 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," From Dusk Till Dawn
","At almost 20 years old, it's a darn shame for me to see that I have never seen this movie. So to keep my 'credibility' as a cinephile, I finally said to myself 'self, watch this movie now, no more waiting.' I also asked myself, 'what do I know about this movie?' Well, it's got Clooney, Tarantino acts in it, Salma Hayek has a sexy dance with a sexy snake, and vampires are a big thing in the movie. Even knowing all that and with the movie being as old as it is, this movie completely caught me by surprise.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko, that are on the run, which we find out right off the bat, in a incredible opening sequence in a gas station. There eyes are set on the Mexican border for an escape, so they spot a little family (the father played by Harvey Keitel) traveling in an RV and get the idea to hijack the vehicle and take the polite family hostage. When the group get's to there destination, a shady little Mexican bar, all hell breaks loose when vampires turn out to run the place.It sounds corny, it sounds cheesy, campy, laughable, maybe a bit over the top, but BY THE NINE, this is not only a cool crime movie, not only is it a dark, creepy vampire movie, but this is a great movie in it's own right. It's so unique and good at how it tell's the story, and you gotta give major credit to director Robert Rodriguez, because the first half of the movie just feels like a dark, gritty, crime-thriller and if the movie would've just kept that tone through out I would've been perfectly fine, but once the setting jumps the fence into Mexico, a whole other level of a movie is unleashed. George Clooney gives one of my favorite performances I've seen from him, he has this menacing screen presence that he doesn't show anymore and I thought was really good. Harvey Keitel is always great in his more gruff roles, I thought he was terrific as the father of the distressed, kidnapped family. It's a bit of a different role and he did a very good job going back and forth with George Clooney. Salma Hayek, my goodness, no words can describe the spell I was in with her screen presence. It's not a groundbreaking role by any means, she's there mostly to look good and that she does. Tarantino has a larger than normal role, he was enjoyable as well, but his real contribution to this movie is his screenplay. The dialog is so spot on and really meshes perfectly with the more crime driven first half. Vampires are kind of a punchline in movies now a days, this film gives the fanged creatures a very good treatment. There's a lot of use practical effects and make-up, the vampires look creepy and demonic and the action is filmed well. There's a shot that stands out to me in the beginning, where Clooney and Tarantino are walking away from a gas station store engulfed in flames. It's one continuous shot, and as the actors are saying their lines, in the back you see flames spitting out and little explosions throwing debris everywhere, you can tell it was done on set, and I loved it. I loved the vampire 'twist' at the end, but I will say that the horror element did kind of get me at a stand still moment, only because the way the movie started as this really intense crime thriller with these two brothers intrigued me. I would have liked to see them stretch on that further, but the insane second half still did it for me, it was a fun watch, and has officially became my favorite vampire movie of all time.",9,0,1,7 May 2014
Godzilla," Major Movie Review: Godzilla (2014)
","I have this mental list that I'm pretty proud of, it's a list that I like to call the 'HOLY TITS LIST'.What kind of list is that?It's a list of movie scenes that blew my mind and made ME squeal in my seat, like a pig being speared in the ribs, because it was pure, awesome, movie magic. That happened while watching this movie and to my embarrassment, my girlfriend knows what that sounds like now. Damn.In GODZILLA, we meet Joe Brody (BRYAN CRANSTON), a supervisor at a nuclear plant in Japan. An earthquake of sorts causes travesty at this plant and it triggers events that brings us to present day. Over the years Joe has become dedicated to find out what the hell really caused that seismic activity and ruined his life. Meanwhile, 'natural disasters' have been happening all over the place and soon enough it's obvious that some giant, menacing monster could be walking around and that's no good for humanity. Dr. Serizawa (KEN WATANABE) is the scientist also trying to find these things to study, then you have Ford Brody (AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON) as a soldier with skills in bomb handling and we follow his character a lot and MAN is it quite the ride! That's the overall plot but believe me guys, the less you know going into this movie the better!Please check out my full review on my Tumblr and let me know what you think, link to that in my InstaBio.What about you guys? Have you seen the newest GODZILLA? Were you blown away or did you leave disappointed? Drop a comment and LET'S TALK MOVIES!",7,3,5,4 February 2015
Her," Her
","I want it known that I have no problem with romance movies. It's just that the genre doesn't turn out as much classic worthy material that I'd get with others like Drama, Animation, Action. However, here comes Her and I now have MY favorite romance film since 500 Days of Summer. Ted is played a sweet, soft-spoken man who's at a difficult point in his life romantically. One day, an new advanced OS system is released to the public and Ted makes the fateful choice of downloading it to his computer and phone to help make work a little easier. Soon enough he sees just how intelligent and human this voice, self named Samantha, really is. I love Her, frankly I couldn't get enough of Her. Joaquin Phoenix kills it in his role, and after coming off of his bat poop crazy performance in The Master? Pfsh the man has range like clutch Ray Allen shot. Scarlett Johansson is literally just a voice, but what she does with that alone got me all choked up and admittedly flustered. The movie is shot beautifully and the sci-fi side is nicely done. All the characters dialog is very well written, especially Samantha's discussions on how she views humanity. The music is awesome, the entire cast is pretty good. This is a great movie of technology and love and life. I give this my highest recommendation.",9,0,2,24 June 2014
