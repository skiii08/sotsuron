Blade Runner 2049," 8/10 VERY CUTE DOG
","Fluffy, scruffy boye of unknown breed. Exceedingly rare. Very loyal. Quiet - no borks. Obviously a classically trained actor, but his subtlety in this endeavor was poignant. Marvelous work.",8,24,38,3 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Lazy jokes and absolutely NO vampires
","Taika Waititi has really lost his groove. Sam Rockwell, who I normally love, wasn't even trying in this role. He wasn't showing his fangs, he wasn't attempting to bite the necks of passing women - you could barely tell he was a vampire at all.",5,1,16,3 January 2020
