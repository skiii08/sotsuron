The Rock," Connery the saving grace.
","What makes this probably the only good flick the anti-christ Michael Bay will ever make is Sean Connery. Only reason. Plain and simple. His expertise as an actor seems to have inspired the rest of the cast and crew to rise above the direction and writing.If this movie hadn't been done by Bruckheimer and Bay (aka Dumb and Dumber; Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum). It would of been better. They did nothing but add the worst parts. It's loud, obnoxious, filmed like a car ad and poorly edited.Hey guys car chase in San Fran...get out the shaky cam.Anyways. Connery is great. Everyone tries to do the same. They barely hold up this sinking ship.",Null,0,1,6 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh Curious George what have you done!
","Alright, before you stone my blasphemous mouth shut, let me just say that Episode one is bad not for the actually movie but what it does to the other three movies.What was so great about Star Wars was that it started in the middle of a story. It was left up to your imagination what happened before.Now he is showing you. Ruining the mystique to everything.Obi Wan was a crusty old knight. You knew very little about him but that didn't bother you cause Alec Guiness brought history into the role. Now you learn he was some little punk with a pony tail. Suddenly Obi Wan isn't so cool.Darth Vader was the ultimate Baddie. Guy in black with a mask and penchant for killing heroes. You knew he used to be good but now he is the pinnacle of bad. Cool. Now you know he was a goofy little punk. Ruined.The force. Cool way of the samurai-magic thingy that no one used except the hippest cats. Now you know it is a concentration of microscopic lifeforms. Ruined.I guess George thinks everyone is a moron and we can't imagine the rest of the story ourselves.What I think the problem was. He got older and richer and richer and richer and lazier.He forgot his maverick sensibilities that he had on Star Wars.He defied the conventional sci-fi genre with Star Wars and created a new ideal for all others to be measured by. Now he is just following his own mold and reinstating conventions he once set out to brake.Not only was this movie boring because of its 'do nothing new, just do it better' attitude, but it takes away from the first movies. Now you can't watch Alec Guiness without thinking Ewan Macgregor doesn't look like him. You can't watch Darth Vader now without thinking of him as a snot nosed kid. Now you can't think of the force without thinking of some parasitic thing called midichlorians.I only hope they never do another Indiana Jones movie cause Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford have all lost their touch.Anyways, I could go on and on about the things wrong with Episode I, such as hidden gimmicks like the E.T. creatures, but I won't because I know the Star Wars freaks want to commence their flogging of this rambling infidel.But before I go I would just like to say.RETURN OF THE JEDI SUCKED TOO!

G.I. Jane," Ridley Scott doing Bruckheimer.
","Kinda weird movie. It's Ridley Scott doing Bruckheimer. But the cliche' Bruckheimer style was really invented by Tony Scott, Ridley's brother on films like Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II, Days of Thunder, Crimson Tide. Where style over Substance reined. Tony in some ways is a knock off of his brother. Both lack some substance but Ridley more than makes up for it with original style. Tony has style but not as imaginative so it usually turns out to be lesser product.Anyways. This isn't a Bruckheimer film but feels like an attempt to be one. Terrible overbearing soundtrack by Trevor Jones, who is doing a Bruckheimer music impression. Bad. Bad. Music.The movie does have it's moments but it plays like an ad for the Navy. So slick. Demi Moore is pretty good, although her breasts, ironically have a supporting role.Not much but eye candy.Why everyone involved felt the need to impersonate an awful schlock factory like Bruckheimer I will never figure out. Maybe cause his movies always make money. They suck. but they make money.Good story by Twohy wasted.",Null,1,3,6 July 2000
Unbreakable," Too intelligent for it's own good.
","I'm sure most people will hate this movie. Most people in the theater were grumbling on their way out. However, I thought it was refreshingly understated and intelligent. Which given it's subject matter makes it near brilliant. It's about super heroes and comic books but it's far too slow and subtle to be a comic-book movie, yet it is laid out like one and everything is a reference to a living comic book.It really is a unique movie. It takes the exact opposite approach to the subject matter and the core of the plot than you would  expect and in result a bizarre kinetic energy is created. It flips on itself back and forth, causing infinite reflection.It has some faults but its merits far outweigh any shortcomings.The photography sometimes is a little heavy handed. The color scheme as a plot device, as in the Sixth Sense is a bit obvious but still cool.Some may argue the ending leaves a lot to desired, but I think that was the point and fits perfectly with the theme of comic books.I recommend it only if you are willing to be patient, open-minded, and you understand the comic book genre (which most people do).Definitely not as overt as the Sixth Sense. It is much more understated. Where as the subtleties in Sixth Sense made it great. This is all about subtlety.I'm pleased this wasn't just another Sixth Sense. I applaud the writer/director/producer's brave effort. Sure he could of done the same thing again, but he didn't and the movie will probably been seen as a failure because of it.",9,0,0,24 November 2000
The Fifth Element," Correction: See my other review.

The Fifth Element," Fun highly watchable sci-fi
","Okay there are some real faults with this film, like its tendency to go a little too far into silliness, which becomes a problem when the film wants to then be serious, but all in all its good points out weigh its bad.A couple good points: This movie is visually stunning, a fresh view in sci-fi. A welcomed change from the dark trashiness that has been watered down and done to death.The story is a pretty original. The editing is particularly good. Pay attention to the ends of scenes, because what ever was talked about in the end of a scene is exactly what the next scene is. The impact this has on the energy of the film is easy to overlook and disregard as obvious.The effects are of course good. They should be considering how many effects houses worked on it and how much this film cost.The acting is good. Bruce Willis is of course Bruce Willis. Gary Oldman is as usual a pleasure to watch. That little piece of plastic on his head is annoying though. I suppose it was put there to make him look silly. However he already looked kinda  weird without his patented evil man goatee.I would say the worst part and completely unnecessary and out of place part of this film is Chris Rock's character. Oh was he annoying. He runs toe to toe with Jar Jar Binks as worst character to almost ruin a movie.I don't know why Luc Besson put him in there. Maybe to poke fun at Americans. All it does is once that overt reference is gone (about five seconds after appears) is leave us with an annoying and overbearing character you just wish would die in a crossfire.Take him away and some other out of place cheesiness (like that stupid creature in Gary Oldman's desk) and you have a perfect movie.So if you want a near perfect sci-fi/action/comedy movie and can handle these sometimes annoying imperfections rent or buy this.Not exactly thinking man's sci-fi, but neither were most of the Star Wars movies.I would equate this with Episode I. Only this was better because it didn't have all that extra baggage.",8,0,1,4 April 2000
X-Men," Pleasantly Surprised.
","I went in expecting a bad movie. I was surprised. It was actually good. Not great. But it had this feeling of not wanting to be great. Or at least not trying to be great, just fun and tightly done. Which it was. The movie is really focused on Wolverine, which is good; I guess they recognized that Wolverine is most people's favorite X-Man. Rogue would be the second banana I guess. She doesn't get to do much but she is the key everyone is after.Some very well-done super hero fight scenes. The strong point of the movie. They are really handled well. Some good special effects. Although they don't make a movie they are used well here.The story trucks along at a brisk pace. A little too brisk in some points. But you are never left too long to think about how silly it all is.Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great together. Hugh Jackman carries the movie.It's greatest fault is it feels like it has been over-edited. It is very streamlined and it leaves with the feeling that they could have taken another half an hour and it would of been great.",7,0,0,17 July 2000
The Beach," Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing?
","Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing? Who cares as long as sexy Leo is shirtless. That alone probably sold this movie. Sad, but true. The fact that Mathew Perry's younger better looking lost brother takes off his shirt is enough to get a studio to waste millions of dollars.Yeah sure Leo can act. But not here. Here he is playing himself. A big dull jerk. He should stop partying and get back to sharpening those acting chops.The movie: It blows. It starts out good. But lots of movies start out good. It's easy to start a movie in the right direction. But this one beaches itself early and sits there flopping like a dying fish for the rest of the movie.Do we want to be Fight Club? Lord of the Flies? Apocolypse Now? Midnight Express? What do we want to be cause we sure aren't original. The premise is too old to be original so it would of been better to pick an angle and go all the way with it.If you want to go do the paradise turns to hell thing then do it. Don't stop halfway and decide to throw in a whole bunch of other junk.Danny Boyle is a good director, I like most all of his other stuff. I even like A Life Less Ordinary. Which leads me to believe most of it can be blamed on Leo. Once Leo is involved you got unneeded clout and pressure. Will it be something the 14 girls can watch? Will they like it? Will they see it over and over? Danny Boyle and Leo seem to be such and odd pair. Leo used to be Danny Boyle material until Titanic (What's Eating gilbert Grape, Basketball Diaries). Then he was big studio property. He's no longer edgy just cocky.Anyways. I wonder if this would of been better with Ewan Macgregor in the lead. Probably since Ewan is infinitely more likeable. There were some parts I liked. Like him killing the shark. Only because I hate sharks and I would love to be able to kill one if I was attacked. The music is good. The scenery is good but not incredible enough to spawn that type of devotion the characters have towards it.Major problem was nobody was likeable. Except the French Guy. The only one who was a decent human being. The rest were arrogant obnoxious selfish cruel hipsters hiding from their yuppy fates.Yet another reminder we are all flawed and bad people.My response to this annoying trend in films: I watch movies to escape. I don't need to be reminded that people suck. I know they suck. Show me idealized heroes. So me people with character, integrity. So me tragedies. But make the hero have at least one really good quality please. These qualities don't need to be limited to Disney oversimplified portrayals.This is a terrible review. It's all over the place.
Kinda like the movie.Skip this movie unless you're a 14 year old girl (who probabaly has already seen it) Rent Lord of the Flies instead. Either version; the old B+W is better though.",2,2,4,28 July 2000
Léon: The Professional," Favorite Luc Besson film.
","This is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Luc Besson film.
Fifth Element is really good but it has some major flaws (Namely Chris Tucker's character), Big Blue is beautiful but Rosanna Arquette is obnoxious and there isn't much to it, La Femme Nikita is great but it is really hard to like the main character, The Messenger is just a bad movie (All because of Milla Jovovich's awful performance), Subway was a little too abstract to be great, I haven't seen Le Dernier Combat (Although I would really like to get a copy of it. Hopefully with the release of Big Blue, Subway and the uncut version of Leon it will be possible to see it soon).Professional- It takes multiple viewings to really appreciate it's subtleties, which most people would deny it has. But once you get past the explosive action, which apon multiple viewings you realize there really isn't much action you'll see that it is mostly about the relationship between Leon and Matilda.And this is where the subtleties come into play. So I suggest watching it a few more times to appreciate just how well-crafted and well-played these characters are.Jean Reno is perfect in this film and Natalie Portman is so good it's scary. (Considering she's so young)Gary Oldman is of course Gary Oldman. He's ferociously great as the over the top crooked cop.Danny Aiello is good as Leon's sort of slimey boss.Just a great original story, great acting, and great action.And it doesn't have the cheesey happy ending that pollutes most movies now.It's not the best movie in the world but for the reasons above and some other unknown reasons it has become one of my favorites. I'm waiting in great anticipation and slight frustration for the un-cut DVD out in August. Great anticipation: the extra 24 minutes. Frustration: I already own the US version on DVD and I don't like having to buy another. They do this on purpose and I think it's really shady of them to not tell you that another version is coming out when they release the original. Although this did come out on DVD a while ago and they probably didn't know they would release another version.But judging by how the uncut version is a best-seller already and isn't coming out till August 15th. I would say I'm not the only one who felt the bite on this one.",10,0,1,17 July 2000
The Thing," The best horror movie ever.
","This is simply the most underrated horror movie ever. It is also the best.When I think horror movie, The Thing is the first movie that comes to mind.Horror movies in my mind are partly special effects. This movie is partly special effects, which is what all the critics couldn't get past. Horror movies to me are also mostly psychological. If the movie can hit and maintain that one disturbing note than it has worked. The Thing keeps that note vibrating through the whole movie. The intrigue and tone is set in the first five minutes.(Not the unnecessary opening titles) What a great way to start a movie and make the viewer think.Yes this movie has incredible effects but they are all secondary to the story. This movie works on so many different levels you can't pigeon hole it because of it's special effects. The special effects are just what's on the surface. The movie works because of the story.The Thing actually makes you think. It's kind of a twist on the who done it mystery. Everything works perfectly. The simplistic heartbeat like score from Ennio Morricone. The isolated setting. The acting. The editing. The great cinematography.Although each character isn't overtly developed, there is a lot of subtlety (something all too rare today) in each performance.This is probably Kurt Russell's best performance. Not that he has a lot of dialogue. It's all in the facial expressions and what he doesn't say but rather communicates with body language. Like when he removes his hood in the climax.Another key performance is Keith David's. Watch his fearful face when he is tied up. His performance in this has made me a fan of his work ever since.Everyone is good in this movie. Other than the effects nothing is thoroughly spelled out for you. It's up to you to figure out just what happened off screen. Something they also don't do anymore. Everything is now hammered into your head.The scariest things are what your own mind comes up with when posed with a few facts and images. Sometimes it's scarier when you don't see the monster. This film really couldn't of done this with respect to the monster but it did make use of that concept elsewhere. Even though it's kinda like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It works better this time knowing what the monster's ghastly intentions and forms are. Instead of the 'don't get caught '(sleeping or awake) mentality of Body Snatchers, The Thing's mentality is best summed up by the original story's title 'Who goes there', which I recommend reading.Great line from the movie.'You gotta be **cking kidding.'Note: Buy this on DVD, it has got to be one of the most comprehensive and feature packed DVDS out there.",10,0,1,4 April 2000
Armageddon," An assault on the senses and insult to the intelligence.
","This movie rocks; This movie is great; The best movie of the decade- All of which I would be saying if I had an IQ of three and actually liked getting kicked in the head with a steel toed boot.Nothing about this movie is good. Well the special effects were okay, but everything else is so offensively bad that the chance of the effects saving this movie is about as plausible as the plot.I'm sorry but Michael Bay is the anti-christ of cinema. I would have rather watched 'Batman and Robin' twice than sit through 30 minutes of this piece of junk.You know the scene in Clockwork Orange where they re-educate Alex with drugs, music and those ultra-violent visuals. Well this movie works just as well. I still feel ill thinking about it.It's like that annoying drunk guy at a bar who smells and is yelling bad jokes in your face. The one you would give anything for just for him to shut up, but you can't leave cause you want to see his butt thrown out of the bar, which is bound to happen at any point.This is cinema for the lowest common denominator.And of course you have morons defending it by saying it's not trying to be anything but entertainment; lighten up; this isn't a merchant ivory pic; it's just $8 worth of fun, etc.Great I'm all for simple mindless fun. But you still need plausibility and story and acting so you can believe. If you don't care about the characters then what is the use of showing me one of them sacrificing himself for another. If it had any of these things (even slightly), then it would of be fun.This movie is like some child telling you some improvised story with action figures: 'And then the Tonka truck guys go into space...and then they land on the ass-teroid...and then they drive around it and almost float away...and they have to put a bomb in a hole..wait wait I forgot the part about the drills...they have these big drills...and then the guy cries...and then the bomb goes booooooooosh. And he saves the world. And the guy kisses the girl whose daddy cried.'I'm just wondering how much they paid the Criterion Collection company to make a special addition DVD of this heaping pile of junk.",1,11,23,6 July 2000
American Beauty," Good? Yes. Overrated? Definitely.
","This movie is neither profound or thought provoking. It is like watching a train wreck. It is preachy without knowing what it is trying to preach. Its protagonist quits his job to smoke pot and enjoy life, something up until that point he had not being doing. Fine. I can dig that. Especially when it is Kevin Spacey as the protagonist. But since you know he dies from the beginning narration it's kind of hard to care. And since he is the only thing interesting in the movie it was impossible to get into to.Acting is good, mainly Spacey. Directing is okay. Writing is okay. Did not deserve all those oscars. But by default it won. Why? because this has been a bad year in movies. Schlock city.Tired of the whole dysfunctional family thing. I don't wanna watch people not being able to relate to people. Or bad people being bad to other people. People People People...Soylent green is made of people and they weren't all bad.Sorry. Yes, everyone is flawed but I don't need to pay $7.50 to be reminded of that.Sixth Sense was better. That should of won oscars. At least that would of encouraged better movies.Given this the oscars is just giving a green light to any independent movie chump to make another twisted people flick.We already have enough PT Andersons.In short Kevin Spacey made this move. Deserved the oscar. The rest of those gold statues should be returned.",5,1,2,29 March 2000
The Game," Great thriller
","Alright this seems to be a hit or miss with a lot of people. Most people who dislike it credit that to it being unbelievable or predictable. Or that they felt nothing for Michael Douglas.I disagree with these comments, probably because I fell for everything. I fell for everything cause I wanted to. It earned my respect from the opening scenes. It just hit the mark with me from frame one. The footage of Nicholas as a boy with his father with that absolutely haunting music was a brilliant opener.That music explains everything. The music and this little prologue add more depth to the movie than some movies have in their entire length.Nobody but Michael Douglas could of pulled this off. He is perfectly cast as Nicholas. He brings so much subtlety to his role. Watch when he is driving in his car talking on his car phone. Watch how he figits and holds the wheel. It fits so perfectly with who is supposed to be.
The build up to the actual game is perfect. Nothing is too abrupt. But once it starts it snowballs into a train ride through hell and doesn't let up until it's fantastic and well suited ending. The plausibility of the logistics of the ending require the viewer to stretch but if you had come along the rest of the way this leap isn't hard to make.A great movie. One of my favorites. The epitome and definition of a thriller. Suspense, dark tone, mystery. Solid slick movie. David Fincher doesn't disappoint. Once again great score. Particularly the piano theme in the beginning. Absolutely haunting. The only other movie that used this type of emotionally charged beginning (where the tone is set up in mere seconds) I feel is Jacob's Ladder. Go see that too.",10,0,2,4 April 2000
The Man Who Would Be King," Sean Connery and Michael Caine at their Finest.
",This movie is the perfect action/adventure movie. Where as Raiders of the Lost Ark is throwback of shorts. This is the real thing. Directed by John Houston from a Kipling story. You can't get much better than that for a foundation. The pairing of Michael Caine and Sean Connery is simply inspired. They work so well together you are with them at every step. A chilling ending too. This movie sticks with you. You'll be thinking about this long after you're done watching it. And you can always pick out something new when you watch it again. I suggest getting it on DVD. There is a nice featurette on the making of the movie. With some great macho behind the scenes atmosphere.One of my favorites. If you liked Raiders of the Lost Ark check this one out.,10,2,4,4 April 2000
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Brilliant concept beautifully executed.
","This movie is brilliant. It isn't just a family film in that it's isn't just for kids or the PG crowd. It's dark tone will appeal to adults and mature audiences. However the dark tone is nothing a child can't handle or probably even notice. The movie is about Halloween!!!!! So stop with it's too dark. If you don't let your kid out on Halloween then fine don't let them see this. Go back to your 24hr brain-wash coddle fest. Stick to Barney and most of the Disney catalog.But if you like to feed you and your child's imagination GO SEE THIS MOVIE!This is the Disney movie that Disney rightfully should not claim as their own. However, it is more Disney in spirit than any Disney film produced in the past twenty years.It is innovative and original. Disney is not anymore. Only productions made outside of their creative stranglehold are any good. (This and the Toy Story movies).Visually, this has to be the most original animated movie ever. Only Tim Burton could of done this and thank god he did.I have watched this movie about ten times and every time I find something new. Something you parents might want to keep in mind, when your child wants to watch this again.
I usually hate songs in movies but these are catchy and kind of sarcastic so they aren't the dreaded formulaic - bad - Broadway wannabe- bathroom break - catnaps that are usually present in EVERY Disney animated movie of the last 11 years.
This movie drips with creativity and heart. Down to the tiniest detail you can tell the animators put their soul into this. Instead of the assembly line animation of Disney's latest merchandising juggernaut.If you like Tim Burton see this. If you are tired of being patronized by Disney see this. If your kid has any kind of imagination and intelligence, shut off the Lion King and make them see this.
Note: DVD has a great picture and sound and is the best way to appreciate this landmark and classic animated film.",10,5,8,5 April 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Simply a tame female version of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest
","I'm sorry you can't make a movie this close to another movie and not have them compared. I first want to say that this is a pretty good movie. However, it has major flaws and just for being so similar to such a classic and beloved movie it has to be extra good in all areas...and it's not.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is better for the following reasons: Jack Nicholson in his prime. (There is nothing better than Jack back when he cared about acting) Milos Forman-superior director. Manigold- heavy handed. More dramatic story. Violent loser gets thrown in Asylum. Triumph of the spirit? Girl Interrupted- Lazy upperclass girl gets pushed into a tame mental health resort. Triumph of psychotherapy?So basically it is of course a lesser movie. Watch Cuckoo's Nest again and you'll see why.Angelie Jolie is good but you don't like her. If that was the point then fine. However, I also didn't like Whine-ona Ryder. So who is left to like? I gotta like someone. Cause why watch a movie about unlikeable people. I liked the Cabbie. I like some of the other resort guests. Whoopie Goldberg was kinda good. Soooooooo. Not enough. Too much lazy girl angst.Still a pretty good movie.",5,1,2,28 July 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Boring Pointless and Excruciatingly Slow
","I love Kubrick. I like almost all of his films. I hated this. Most of his movies are slow paced. That is fine. They are also interesting, thought provoking, and beautiful as they unfold. This was none of these things. I wanted Nicole Kidman to drop dead. She took so long in getting out her dialogue that I swear you can use audio excerpts in a hypnosis class. I just thought this was painful to watch. There are only two movies on tape that I have come close to or have actually turned off and returned without watching the rest. This came close, but out of respect for all the pleasure Kubrick has given me as a viewer on other films I felt I should at least sit through the whole thing. I wish I hadn't. I wish I never saw this and just always thought of it as that lost Kubrick movie I never saw. Then I wouldn't know it was bad, and I wouldn't now see Kubrick as a lesser director. I have an on going theory that none of the greats can make a good movie in Hollywood anymore. Maybe I have just become jaded and good movies don't seem as good.But this was bad. Completely bad. I liked the music. That is it. Maybe it's because I don't like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. They are both too serious for their own good. Or maybe it was all Kubrick. I do know that I have had enough of Kidman Cruise for a long time. Remember Risky Business. Remember Batman Forever. Somewhere along the way these two fooled Hollywood into thinking they could act. Instead of putting them both in a movie how about taking Cruise's smile and plastering it on Kidman's bare butt.You got the best of both of them and you don't have to listen to them talk.",7,0,1,29 March 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Undeniably good.
","Okay I went into this thinking it was going to be some British Tarantino rip-off, which it basically is. However, it is so much fun and there are so many twists and turns that you don't care. The characters are all well written, believable, and likeable. You forget the Tarantino similarities very quickly and it soon surpasses any comparisons and becomes it's own movie. Very well done. Great tongue in cheek feel. Never takes itself too seriously. The writer/director is definitely someone to keep and eye on.",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Amélie," Brilliant!
","This film is simply brilliant. Absolutely original, a lovestory/romantic comedy with not one cliché'. Every moment is sonew that it makes you wonder how someone came up with something so original in a time when movies are just variations onthe same over-used formula.Everything is in the details and this film proves it. This movie is sorich in detail and character that it doesn't need to beg to bewatched more than once, it charms you into wanting to seeing itagain.I'm not a fan of the romantic comedy genre in general and yet thereisn't a single moment in this film I didn't like.I think the director/co-writer has been working his way up tosomething like this. It seems to be a completely undiluted vision. I only hope he has more to give us, because this one is going tobe hard to top.It's no surprise that the Academy once again didn't have a cluewhen they not only didn't nominate this for the main best picturecategory but it didn't even win best foreign film. Why was Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon nominated the yearbefore in the main best picture category and not this in 2001? I love dark depressing films and yet this film is so great that itmakes its way into my list of favorites. it is the epitome of a feelgood movie, without being cheap or sugary. Pure fun.Exactly what movies should do. It makes you think. It makes youhappy. It makes you forget your troubles for two hours and renewsyour faith (temporarily) in humanity. What more could you ask for?Well maybe accurate subtitles. The just released DVD has fairly inaccurate subtitles. I counted aleast five mistakes in the English subtitles. For example, Ameliephones Nino and tells him to turn to page 56 (or something to theeffect) but the subtitle reads 'turn to Page St' What the hell does that mean? Another is there are numerous references to Lady Diana's death. The grocer is talking about the alcohol level in the driver of her carwhen it crashed. However the subtitles read. 'The trucker had analcohol level of ...' Now we have no idea that they are talking about Diana's chauffeur,you can clearly hear the grocer saying chauffeur. Chauffeur is nottrucker in English. The meaning of that line is lost. unless youknow a little French. Unfortunately, my French is not good enoughto pick out all the other possible mistranslations. It's verydisheartening to suspect  you might be missing more becausesome dumb ass translator wasn't doing their job right. French isan easy language to translate into English. It's not like Japaneseor Russian. So why the errors? Who knows. Maybe so they can re-release a better version laterand make everyone buy it again.Anyways. great film. Still worth buying on DVD.",10,0,2,22 July 2002
Braveheart," Perfection
","This is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest offering. He will never direct or act in anything better. Which is a shame. Since I'm sure he'll be in a lot more movies. And each one seems to be another step down.At least he will always have this.Braveheart is perfect in almost every way. There is just so much passion put into this movie that you cannot help being caught up in it. The story is never boring. The characters are all fleshed out nicely. The romance is believable and touching. The music is moving. Great action pieces. There isn't much you can say about this movie other than it's perfect.Maybe it's better if Gibson doesn't direct anything else. Maybe he realized that this was as good as he gets.
Costner hasn't yet learned that lesson I think.",10,1,3,8 August 2000
