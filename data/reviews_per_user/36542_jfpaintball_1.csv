Mission: Impossible III," Great
","I reluctantly went to go see this movie...I had been quite 'turned off' by what the press had dubbed the 'cruise-missle'. I have to say...definitely the best of the MI movies, and one of Tom Cruise's best performances...the man is one heck of an actor. Scenes were succinct and action packed. It is the type of movie that takes off and never lets up. It was also particularly interesting and very enjoyable to see how they cam up with new tricks, new strategies and great locations for the cast to film at. A very inventive story with tremendous action and just the right bit of 'comedy', and of course a great job of blending in the old cast and the MI 'tricks' (such as the face mask and voice chip') with new cast and new ideas. Ultimately, a great movie, great acting, great directing and a very entertaining film!",10,1,3,29 August 2006
