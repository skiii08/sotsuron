Lucky Number Slevin," If you like to use your brain, watch this movie
","When I was in Prague with my girlfriend, we decided spontaneously to go to the movies. Due to the relative small population of the Czech republic the film was shown in English with Czech subtitles. In fact, we didn't want to watch this movie, but we came to late for our chosen film, so we came in ca. 10 minutes after it had begun. So, if you know the movie you will have noticed, that we missed the first really important minutes, where the story was set up. As a result the movie was very confusing for us in the beginning, but as the movie went on we discovered the background story and all the things that we were not to see, which was absolutely catching. We soaked up every minute of this movie like a sponge. Beside the great story, every single actor or actress takes off the edge. Since Pulp Fiction I never took another film in concern when I was thinking about my favorite movie. But NOW I do have a new one!Watch this film if you want to be entertained AND if you want to use your brain while watching!Other similar films: pulp fiction, reservoir dogs",10,7,10,22 September 2007
War of the Worlds," Someone's idea while sitting on the toilet
","Im here to warn everyone , whose IQ is higher than the usual rooms temperature. It might be a film , which has a lot of good special effects, it might be a film which has a good cut and so on....but if you're looking for a film which has something that you call a 'story', keep your hands of it! after watching the movie i was sitting on my couch , together with a pal, and we were both laughing out loud and couldn't stop for at least half an hour because of that idea less and crappy end...to be honest, a 6 year old child could have done better. Sometimes I thought 'Well, seems to be great, now to hear the big surprising sense of it' and then I was sitting there, being stunned, and yes, because I was surprised...surprised, that one can make a whole lot of money out of crap! You cant improve a movie by using big stars who are engaged in Scientology,no, there have to be some really great ideas and some intelligence, too. That all might sound hard, but its the way I feel about this movie. If you want to see it though, borrow it from a friend, who has bought it, otherwise you will be angry about your lost money. Think about it, and then take the movie next to it!",1,2,8,28 July 2007
