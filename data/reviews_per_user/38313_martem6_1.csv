Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3
","Compared to the previous other two Iron Man films, this third installment to the franchise truly lived up to the hype. The story begins with an obsessive Tony Stark constantly creating a variety of new amour's and being traumatized after the events of The Avengers. Stark also have to deal with a homicidal maniac who goes by the name The Mandarin. With great pacing and a straight-forward plot, this film had many aspects which supported it. Robert Downey Jr and Guy Pierce both displayed tremendous acting and brought the Iron Man story to a thrilling and meaningful conclusion. This film was arguably the longest within the saga as well as the darkest, by looking at other reviews from viewers, it highly lacked humor, however it was still capable of achieving the greatest Iron Man installment with it's cracking action and moderate humor.",8,1,7,27 April 2013
