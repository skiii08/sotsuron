Skyfall," Two and a half hour wasted
","The movie was lacking whatever a movie has to have. The plot was a total clich√© and easily predictable. To me, the 'bad' guy and his attitude was a poor counterfeiter of Joker (in Dark Night). I could not stop myself thinking about the budget allocation, where did all the money go? Probably spent on tuxedos and suits otherwise there was no breathtaking costly scene or something. The voice quality was horrible, I had to stick out my ears because not everyone is spoon eared like James Bond.All in all, it was not entertaining, nor a thriller, rather I felt it was a set-up to kill my hours and take my money.",6,7,16,15 November 2012
