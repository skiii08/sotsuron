Changeling," An excellent film! Congratulations to all who made this!
","This is a well crafted film and a very moving story. Mr. Clint Eastwood's directing is, as always, superb - his deft austerity of style finely balanced with the patience to capture the emotional depth and integrity of the performances. He clearly understands the needs of actors and also knows how to remain creatively open to capture the brilliant moments as they happen.Ms. Angelina Jolie is impeccable and truthful as Christine Collins. Her performance is visceral in emotion yet subtle. It is wonderful to see her become the character to the point where we forget we are watching Angelina Jolie but instead are captivated by her character. That is the mark of being more than a star, but being a true actor.Mr. John Malkovich also achieves this, never wavering from the truth of the scene. His performance in this film is heartfelt and real, his acting without pretense. Pure, focused, and most importantly, authentic. It is a refreshing reminder of why he is so revered.The other actors in this film stepped up to the plate and gave commendable performances. Colm Feore is, as always, engaging in his charm (practiced without seeming so), Jason Butler Harner natural and upsetting (as the character should be), Jeffrey Donovan riveting and precise (like a finely tuned instrument) Michael Kelly edgy and honest (an honest cop without ever being clich√©) Amy Ryan exciting and unwavering (always real in each moment). The list goes on.Critics often criticize rather than critique. I am not a critic. I am a filmmaker, thus it is rare that a film will engage me to the point where I am no longer dissecting it as I am watching. This one did, so I felt compelled to write something. For what it is worth, Bravo to everyone involved, to the Writer for bringing this story to light and to the Producers who believed enough make it happen and to the Cast and Crew for what is clearly a successful collaboration. Let us hope that Hollywood takes the time to make more films like this one.Regards, David Krae",Null,3,4,20 February 2009
