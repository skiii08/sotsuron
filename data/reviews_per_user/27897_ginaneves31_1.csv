Come and See," One of the Most Realistic Portrayals of the Savagery of War
","Come and See, a Russian film that touches on the dreadful experiences the Russian citizens underwent during the Nazi German invasion of World War II. Elem Klimov, the director of the movie, illustrates a captivating story by bringing to life all of the five senses of the viewer. Klimov, through filming with a hand-held camera and through the use of authentic settings and props, captures beautifully the smell, sound, sight, taste, and touch of each scene. This allows the audience to be able to experience the film as if they were really there. The film focuses on the main character Florya, a boy from a small Russian village. Florya is accompanied by a girl named Glasha after he is called upon to help the Russians defend themselves from the Nazi invasion. Due to circumstances beyond their control, these two young individuals are forced to wander the Russian wilderness while, at the same time searching for Florya's family. Florya and Glasha fight for their survival as they witness the death of many villagers. Their encounters allow the audience to witness the physical and psychological horrors brought upon by the Nazi's invasion of Byelorussia. Florya, after finding other survivors and finding out that his family is dead, realizes that he is temporarily deaf and goes off with a support team in search for food to help the other survivors. During his journey, he encounters appalling experiences as he tries to stay alive. The boy, Florya, continues to keep his life through pure luck as his life is spared over and over again. Klimov, through his powerful imagery and through the use of Mozart's Requiem in the closing scene, gives the viewer a true sense of the atrocities that took place during World War II.",10,1,1,15 June 2009
