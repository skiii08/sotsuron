Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'The Force is strong with this one.'
","This is clearly a movie for 'Star Wars' fans who are returing to see the benging of the most famous film trillogy every made, and for those coming to see it for the first time. A special effects masterpiece. Especaly the climax duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Qui-Gon Jinn taking on Darth Maul.'The Phantom Menace' is a non-stop adventure for 'Star Wars' fans old and young.",4,0,1,5 January 2000
Citizen Kane," Defentely one of the greatest films ever made
","'Citzen Kane' in my option at least. Is an excellent piece of film making, especaly since the director Orson Wells was only 25 when he made it. (Not bad.) However, it is not the greatest film ever made. (To me there is no such thing,) but it deserves a '10' for it's in creadtable effort.",10,1,2,30 June 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," A perfect 10/10
","This is about as close as one can get to the 'perfect movie' as hollywood, or anyone in that case will ever get. Jimmy Stewart's performace was flawless, and was well matched by Donna Reed. Yet while there are some stereotypical things in the story, it's still an excellent film, a holiday classic, and I'd rather take my kids to see this (if i had any) rather than that bulls**t called 'Pokemon'.",10,1,5,30 June 2001
The Green Mile," Beautifull
","Beautifully done, 'The Green Mile' is the best dramatic film by far this year. With a great cast, (Tom Hanks nearly stole the show this time) and astory that stays true to the original novel. Even though it clocks in at three hours and ten minutes, it is worth seeing.",10,1,2,30 December 1999
