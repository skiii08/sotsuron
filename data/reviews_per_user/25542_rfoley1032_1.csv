The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Still trying to understand Veronica.
","A Toyota new car dealer told me he's give me the name of a movie that would be so impressive I'd buy a car from him the next time I saw him. Red, White and Blue trilogy by Kieslowski. I've watched them 5 times still spellbound by how Kieslowski interweaves, cross-references, and develops his themes. I think about these movies all the time and discover something new. But Veronica? I've watched it twice and am still waiting. Oh, I like the it but compared to the others it seems self-conscious. I've got some more Kieslowski on order. I'll buy a car from  that dealer. He was right.",Null,2,7,3 May 2002
