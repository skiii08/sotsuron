Hereditary," Overuse of dimly lit scenes, low audio track and slow pacing...
","Nothing special here, regardless of the deceptively high ratings. The director over used dimly lit scenes and barely audible audio track to add 'atmosphere' I guess and the characters don't act or react the way most humans would when confronted with supernatural happenings in their living space. Add to that, there's clear history of mental health issues within the family yet none of them are shown receiving mental health counseling or support, even after traumatic events take place. And the big reveal at the end is hokey and underwhelming.You won't miss much if you pass on this one.",5,0,0,2 May 2020
