Iron Man 3," Awesome but also Disappointing
","I'm a Massive Iron Man fan I loved 1, 2 was OK till whiplash got a suit and Avengers was pure brilliance, so I was really looking forward too this.I loved the most of the film but, I was really shocked and also majorly disappointed when you find out Ben Kingsley's 'Mandarin' is actually just an actor, the thing that annoyed me most was how his role from then on was stupid and jokey.I loved the character Harley and you could see connection between the kid and Robert Downey Jnr. it was really funny, but I felt this was played on a tad too much, and was borderline cheesy.One thing I felt was a bad idea was that the film is set around Christmas, the thing is you don't want to watch a film with references to Christmas in August (I still probably will) Mark Ruffalo's cameo in the after credit scene was brilliant and just played on the whole Avengers bromance, which was brilliant.I thought the whole Extremis plot was pretty cool and unlike Iron Man 2 it wasn't samey to Iron Man 1, and I loved seeing Yinsen at the beginning of the film.In summary I loved it but some bits got on my nerves a bit.",8,1,14,25 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," My Favorite Film
","Wow this film is so good and I couldn't think of anything negative to say about it until I went deep into what I didn't like about the movie.I will start off with my negatives, firstly the clich√© story of a lesser character helping the bad guy because his child is dying and the bad guy can save them, but as I think about this there isn't really any other way you would play that out.I felt that the Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) vs. the Klingons was bad ass but there wasn't much of it, I also would of liked to have seen more of Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) interacting with the Klingons, but maybe that is being saved for the third instalment.I'm sure J.J Abrams has an addiction to lens flare, and that it must be in every other shot.I really loved the action in this film, I thought the sets were brilliant, the music was good, it was funny but not too funny, I absolutely loved the scene with Kirk and Khan flying towards the Blackbird ship (Marcus's Ship) and avoiding the debris, I was on the edge of my seat.I also loved how like the first J.J Abrams Star Trek film that it related to the TV series with the music and the fact they were going on there 5 year mission.I really do love this film and I'm more of a Star Wars fan, so its got to be good hasn't it to make my top 3 films of all time. I really cant wait for the threequal.Thank you for reading my review I hope you found it useful, 10/10 :)",9,5,11,8 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Awesome
","I grew up watching the Lords Of The Ring trilogy and I watched an Unexpected Journey as soon as it was released and then read the book of the Hobbit and loved everything.The Desolation of Smaug was amazing, the main problem for me with this film was the CGI I watched it in 3D HFR at 48fps instead of standard 24fps and this seemed to heavily effect the CGI, with a lot of it seeming to be quite video game like apart from Smaug himself who was 100% perfectly created and looked real.I also didn't like how Kili, Fili, Bofur and Oin stay in Laketown as I felt this broke up the party and we kept checking between two locations.I felt that with parts of the book that seemed to be long and enjoyable there was hardly any time spent on these scenes during the film bits sticking out being Beorns House, and Mirkwood. I felt far to long was spent in Laketown. I also thought that the scenes with Gandalf alone seemed to be quite boring compared to those with the company.Probably my favourite sequence from the whole film would be the barrel sequence along the river with non stop action full on bad ass moments and a little bit of humour as well.another thoroughly enjoyable part is Bilbos first encounter with Smaug which is both breath taking and tense.Just waiting for the 13th December 2014 now....",7,6,15,13 December 2013
Django Unchained," Brilliant
","Another Tarrantino masterpiece in the form of the Western Django Unchained, with an awesome cast and awesome director and an awesome storyline Django Unchained is Amazing.I only have a few criticisms of this film and I feel this is what keeps it at a 9 for me and keeps it off of a 10.My first objection is the fact that I find there are 3 thing's that I thought were not needed these were the scene with the Mandingo Fighting as I thought this was unnecessarily violent, but then again what do you expect when watching a Tarrantino movie.The scene where the Mandingo fighter D'artagnan is ripped to pieces by the dogs, I thought this was shown in to much detail.Thirdly the part where Brumhilda (Kerry Washington) was in the Hot Box, I felt it would have been better had she been working in a field or something along those lines (but then again she was a house slave).My next criticism is the Length of the movie as I feel it could be shortened by 20 minutes with the reduction of the Le Quint Dickey Mining company etc. all though some of this was important to the plot, I just believe that it could have ended 10 - 15 minutes after Calvin Cnadie (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Dr King Schults (Christoph Waltz) deaths, but still including bits like Laura Candie and Stephen's (Samuel L Jackson) deaths and the shoot out in 'In The Big House'.I also believed that the part with Tarrantino's cameo was really awful as I thought the two other Le Quint Dickey Mining Company employees had thick Australian accents, and that Tarrantinos would be better suited in the hut with the guys with the dogs or riding a horse while on the route to Candie Land.Thankyou for reading my review of Django Unchained, I hope you found it useful. 9/10 from me :)",9,1,4,8 June 2013
The Wolverine," Awesome
","This film was awesome and blows 'X-men Origins Wolverine' out of the water, everything about this film was amazing, I loved the fight scenes the one on the Bullet train was brilliant, so was the one at Yashida's funeral.One of the things that made this film so good for me was how for the most part of the film Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) doesn't have his power of regeneration so he's just a mortal with awesome claws.One thing I wasn't keen on with this film was Jean Grey (Famke Janssen)presence in this film I thought she was stupidly pointless and if anything brought unnecessary complexity to the plot.I loved the end credit scene this just wrapped it up as Logan was leaving with Yukio(Rila Fukushima) on a plane and then he's in an airport in the end credit scene. The end credit scene has left me feeling really excited for 'Day's of Future past' and I cant wait for the 23rd of May 2014 to see that.10/10 Thanks for reading :)",8,19,39,25 July 2013
The Hangover Part III," 'We had a sick night bitches'
","I went into this film expecting a few cheap laughs and not much of a story line, but I was proved wrong. I feel personally this is the best movie of the Hangover trilogy.I found that this film had more of a plot and when stuff went wrong you do feel for the characters unlike in the first two films. The film had me laughing a lot and Ken Jeong (Lesley Chow) was brilliant and I loved the fact he was a bigger character in this film.I loved the twist of how the Wolf Pack (minus Doug as usual)are helping Chow to break into his old house to retrieve the $21 million owed to Marshall (John Goodman) but it turns out that the house belongs to Marshall and they have helped Chow steal the other $21 million. I thought this was a really clever and hysterical twist in the film.I personally believe that this film would of been better if so much hadn't been revealed in the trailer's i.e. When Chow and Alan are on the bench and he says 'hey fat stuff give me some sugar' and Alan kisses him, The scene with the chickens/cocks, when Chow parachutes off of Ceasers Palace and sings 'I believe I can fly' and shouts 'I LOVE COCAINE', when Alan says 'Lesley we cant be friends anymore, when we get together bad things happen and people get hurt' Chow 'yeah that's the point its funny'.The after credit scene was hilarious and capped off the brilliance of the movie for me. Chow enters Katana in hand and full glory on show says 'We had a sick night bitches'.8/10 from me, I hope you found this review of the Hangover 3 useful, thanks for reading :).",8,0,3,10 June 2013
