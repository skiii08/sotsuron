The Hangover," This is a pretty funny movie.
","I wasn't going to watch this movie because normally films of this type are an utter waste of time.However, After a few minutes, it caught my interest and I ended up watching the whole thing.It wasn't rolling on the ground funny but it was outrageous and interesting enough to draw me in and make me want to see the ultimate conclusion.I could identify with the characters and have had a few Vegas nights where I woke up wondering where the heck my pants were.To the naysayers... if you are looking for something witty and cerebral...forget it..just relax and enjoy the silliness.",10,2,4,1 June 2010
