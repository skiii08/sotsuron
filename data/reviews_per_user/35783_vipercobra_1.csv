Resident Evil: Afterlife," Good in the first hour, but boring in the last 30 minutes!
","When I knew the 4th Sequel of this movie was about to be released, my expectation was went high. The queue to watch the premier last week was awful! The first 60 minutes of this movie was just incredible. But, when the movie starting to show some out of mind scenes (ex: matrix scene, alien scene, etc)...My mind just blown from a very good movie to a disappointing movie.I rate this movie 4/10 because the last 30 minutes of the movie was just boring and most of the scenes were expected! I don't recommend this movie for people who held high for a better movie than the last sequel.",4,8,18,23 September 2010
