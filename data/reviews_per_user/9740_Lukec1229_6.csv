Casablanca," Casablanca 1942
","When a lot of people think of 'Casablanca' they think mostly of the romantic nature of the film and focus all their attention on this, but this film was much more than just a great romance. The film has elements of action, suspense, and is a comedic goldmine with plenty of iconic quotes and memorable scenes. All of the acting was excellent in this movie with special recognition going to Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Claude Rains as Captain Renault, who both made up the two most dynamic characters in the film and really made it a winner. In addition to the excellent characters and cast, the story was also very interesting and dynamic, and the ending was a pleasant surprise.",8,0,1,20 October 2015
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane 1941
","I would have to say I wasn't particularly impressed with the story told through this film, even if it is based on a real one, but much more was I impressed by the manner in which it was told. The film was rather unique for it's time in how it sets up the plot at the end of the main character's life and then continues to tell the story of it through a series of flashbacks. Not just how the story was told, but also how it was filmed. The cinematography in this movie is probably one of its best features. The lighting, camera angles, special effects, fades, and pans are all very well done, present throughout the entire film, and all add to the complexity of it. While the story fell a little short for me (not saying it was bad just not my taste), I thought the meanings presented in it (wealth doesn't = happiness, powerful man can't keep/control everything, etc.), and the examination of a man through the people he knew throughout his life were all pretty cool things.",7,0,3,28 October 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
","No joke, this is one of the best science fiction films I have ever seen and it's from 1968. The effects were amazing considering the time period and they still look pretty good today. The cinematography was also pretty incredible. The way in which all of the strange camera angles and camera effects used throughout the film, work together in conjunction with the effect of no gravity, create this confusing, cramped atmosphere that really makes it seem like space. The long stretches of music in the vacuum of space and the extended periods of no dialogue throughout the film somehow just fit perfectly. It's a strange and mysterious film and the ending is definitely something out of this world, but it just makes for one great sci-fi film.",9,4,10,16 December 2015
The Graduate," The Graduate (1967)
","This was kind of a strange, awkward, and socially distressing movie, and at times pretty unrealistic as well, but don't get me wrong, I think it was an awesome and clever film. First of all the cinematography and soundtrack for the film were great. There were some great scenes and shots in the movie and the music of Simon and Garfunkel I think fit perfectly with the characters, situations, and the film as a whole. While some of the situations seem impractical and unrealistic, it doesn't really matter, because the characters, their emotions, and their reactions, are what really make this movie a great one, and the acting really helps make this a reality.",8,0,1,14 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' In the Rain (1952)
","I'm not usually one for musicals, but this film was actually pretty enjoyable. The story was interesting and making it about the change from silent to talking films was a good subject. It not only showed how people felt about it, but what it also meant for the actors/actress' and the movie business at the time. This was the perfect subject for the film as in this film they also show just how far sound and color have come from the age that is portrayed, putting on elaborate and colorful singing and dancing routines. Some of the routines did get a little carried away at times, but overall they weren't too frequent or overbearing and there was a pretty good balance of musical and story.",7,1,2,3 December 2015
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction (1994)
","This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once.",9,4,8,14 December 2015
