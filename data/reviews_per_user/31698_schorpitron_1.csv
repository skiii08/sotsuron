Blade Runner 2049," I've been waiting for scifi like this for so long
","Honestly I love original movie. Cyberpunk with strong noir atmosphere, with existential questions and where the utopian future world is completely possible is for me like dream comes true. And this movie gives me the same feeling. Yeah It's a little bit different in atmosphere(which is still stunning and probably the most beautiful I have ever seen), but because it's throught perspective of different protagonist, I can take it. It's still the same world with overpopulation, poverty and where questions of who is and isn't alive being and what does it even mean to be alive go even further than in the original. For example the hologram Joi... I love that character. The story is completely new, touching and follows up perfectly previous movie. Only the ending somehow felt that there's gonna be sequel. And honestly when this movie came to the theatre I was skeptical and I didn't go to see it... God, I was foolish. This is Blade Runner! This is one of the best sequels ever and one of the best sci-fi movies since Matrix! This is Blade Runner 2049.",10,2,10,7 March 2018
