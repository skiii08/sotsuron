The Avengers," no fan of the genre, but I enjoyed it
","I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I enjoyed this movie.An action movie based on marvel comics: that implies thrills and over-the-top-CGI. This is a great movie if you are not looking for anything more.Action movies stand or fall by their foes. In this case, you are presented a great villain.As for the heroes, Robert Downey Jr is at its best, and Samuel L. Jackson does his part. They make the difference in my opinion.**** possible spoiler alert ****I was a bit disappointed by the fact only ONE foe had to fight a squad of heroes. But maybe I'm asking too much here, as the script brought in some other elements to counter that",7,1,3,5 September 2012
