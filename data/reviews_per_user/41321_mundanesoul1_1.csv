The Ring," Raising The Bar
","I've seen a lot of horror films in my life, and it's been a very long time since there has been one has well done as this one.  I gave it a 10 out of 10 because it's the first movie in years that has kept me scared for months after I watched it.  Even in the shower I get nervous (Samara's in the drain, you know).  I'd like to thank Gore Verbinski for finally, FINALLY making a movie that is truly frightening.  We need more horror movies that are psychologically terrifying, NOT gore-packed jump-fests filled with awful, second rate acting.  A really well-made movie that definitely caught me off guard.  Go see it now!",10,1,1,26 February 2003
