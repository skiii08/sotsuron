Casablanca," In Casablanca movie shows us how you can sacrifice your life to protect the love one's
","Casablanca one of the most best black and white movie filmed in 4:3 ratio. Second thing that impressed my eyes was the flashback when Humphrey Bogart had a memory back of Ingrid Bergman who promised to Bogart at the train station. 'Kiss me more than the last time' such words spark Ingrid and makes Bogart to in-love with her. Third things involve my attention is work of artistic of lights was amazing and looks realistic. Afterwards film director Michael Curtiz and Cinematography Arthur Edeson they create an attractive shots and scene setting. Eventually camera motion panning, tilt up and down search a wonderful work. Last but not least 'Ricks Cafe Americana' its all about open your eyes people can still out of your pocket while you up, honestly that's how Casablanca even today you should be careful when walking on the street some can still from your pocket. Finally the movie its all about love and sacrifice Bogart 'Rick Blain' sacrificed Ingrid Bergman 'Ilsa Lund' with there former love makes Paul 'Victor Laszlo' to be saved from the hand of bad people.",9,1,2,2 March 2017
