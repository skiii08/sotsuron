Blade Runner 2049," Better than TRON Legacy
","What Blade runner 2049 remindes me of is TRON Legacy. They kinderen of look interchangable soe times. Both are sequels of an earlier rougher movie. The original Blade runner and the original TRON were not do much masterpieces, but more experimental movies that showed a form of film making that werent too succesfilm but got a cult following. TRON did something that was never done before, a movie with lots of CGI, something that was never done before in that extend. But is was so new ,so alien that it had an Unique style and a very specific atmosphere. The world of TRON sucked me in to a world that I was very fond of. Not only tried they create a world inside of a computer, but even the language was computer based. Time was done in cyclus, people were programs, made by users and you could almost smell the electronic atmosphere.
Everything was glowing.TRON Legacy was a disgrace. Gone was the computer world and everything went into style. It was like a super commercialisering version of the original. It was just Some kind of a fashion show. All those hand coded machines that gave you that computer feeling was gone. It was just eyecandy. I just could not imagine that those new lightcycles were made out of code, it didnt feel artificial.Blade runner 2049 is similar, it's almost the same style als TRON Legacy.Its predecessor was almost als clumsy as the original TRON, it had this Unique atmosphere confusing sometimes, overwhelming.And here again they made a sequel where style and design were almost more important than its story. Both seuels look like a themed version of a parfume commercial.But where TRON Legacy only showed style, Blade runner 2049 stayed in los angeles, it was still that overcrowded city, it had still those skinners, and there were still those rogue replicants. It wasnt that dirty as in the original Blade runner, but at least I still could believe that it was happening in that same world and not in that stylized copy that TRON Legacy was. It had a story that made sense, it was a bit slow, as in Stalker, but it was still Blade runner. And That's What I liked about it. It could have been much worse. Its not as good as the low budget original, but I liked it anyway. jjjmrij Jimmy",3,2,3,18 January 2018
