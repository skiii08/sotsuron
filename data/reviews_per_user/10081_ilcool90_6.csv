Ford v Ferrari," Follows the historic events to the letter
","Just returned from the cinema. Another great performance from Bale and Damon. Great character development. The movie moves so fluently that it was felt much shorter than 2,5 hours. Instant Blu Ray purchase when it comes out. Another brilliant piece from the director that gave us Logan and Walk the Line.",10,9,24,16 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," George Lucas directed this movie ( there is no other explanation )
","After the total train wreck of Harry Potter - Star wars cross over that was Episode 7 this was the star wars movie that put the smile back on my face. The only explanation I have is that George Lucas has locked up Gareth Edwards in a closet, gathered several actors from Episode 3 ( Senator Bail Organa ) and 4 ( Grand Moff Tarkin ) and directed this. This movie is such a great mix between Episode 3 and 4 ( both directed by Lucas ). A note to the prequel trilogy haters who didn't liked the detailed political talk, well it's back in this movie and that makes it even more good, because it actually explains all the stuff that is happening. Ship and location designs are again all Lucas and look a lot like in the prequel trilogy. Unpolished and raw like Tatooine and polished like Coruscant great mix. Also this movie really shows why there is a rebellion against the Empire. The repression of the Empire is shown in all it's anti-glory. Seeing Darth Vader again is such a great experience. The most memorable characters of the movie is in my opinion is Chirrut ÃŽmwe and the very sarcastic android voiced by Alan Tudyk Can't wait for this movie to be released on Blu-ray because watching this and immediately afterwards Episode 4 will be quite the experience and I will just pretend episode 7 never happened.",10,4,10,16 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," As annoying as the last reboot
","This technically a 4th reboot of Spider-man ( if you count the one from the 70s ).And it is very cringeworthy compared to the superb Sam Raimi trilogy ( okay the 3rd movie did have it's weak moments but was still better than this thing ).Peter Parker in this one is a very current day teenager who is glued to his smartphone and it is shown over and over and over again. His sidekick / best friend is also unwatchable because of the same issues. The only good thing about this movie is the villain played by Michael Keaton. A real joy to watch, strong, mature and makes sense. This is the most childish ( in the bad sense of that word ) Marvel universe movie made, I would have preferred a Black widow stand alone flick over this rubbish, but the fans demanded it and well they received it. Sad.",3,4,11,3 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," An epic first part of the grand avengers finale.
","Visited today the long awaited first part of the avengers grand finale. I was very pleased with what I saw. 
Brilliant looking CGI, strong story and a massive triple A cast. 
And of-course a lot of long action sequences that never got boring.Josh Brolin played an awesome bad guy Thanos who's explanation of his deeds
actually made sense, and that is weird because the expectation was to hate 
this guy.Here come the spoilers, I warned you. Red Scull aka Hugo Weaving makes an appearance and that was really an exiting moment
because it felt that he wasn't given enough screen time in the first Captain America. And then we arrive to the moment where several Avengers get axed. 
And I actually only felt sorry for one of the choices. Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier. The rest of the axed ones I always considered extra's anyway. 
For example Black Panther, because of the extremely annoying media coverage 
That his stand alone movie got I could not be any happier that his movie career got terminated quickly. To know of other casualties go watch this epic movie, the current 9.3 imdb rating is fully deserved.",10,18,44,25 April 2018
Joker," It's great but not on Heath Ledger's level
","Joker is portrayed brilliantly by Phoenix.You really start to feel for the Joker and understand why he does what he does.
I really don't understand the criticism that this film get's from the so called press, also the stupid questions from the media towards J. Phoenix.The movie is in no way disturbing and just shows the raw reality and what it can lead to when someone eventually snaps.I also loved how Batman's origin story was put in this movie with face to face meeting of young Bruce and Arthur. That's why it needs a sequel, really needs it.This Joker can't be compared to the one from Dark Knight. Phoenix is great but he is no Heath Ledger ( Ledger's Joker was delightfully more bonkers that the one Poenix portrays ).",9,2,4,3 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone
","So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7. Here is a fast and short opinion: The movie blows really blows. Here is the more detailed opinion.The movie has no star wars feeling. None. No deep dialogs about the force and almost no background about what happened in the period between episode 6 and this one. The dialogs between Ray and Finn sound like two modern age teenagers talking (first real dialogue between them, Finn asks Ray if she has a boyfriend). Horrible.Then there is the First Order (successors of The Empire) the bad guys. Their leader commander is the Sith wimp Kylo Ren who answers to a extremely bad CGI drawn Supreme leader (really?) about whom the audience doesn't get any information at all. Kylo Ren is an insecure teenager with anger issues. His character destroys the sleek mysterious Sith presentation of the both prequel as the original trilogy. This is really a bad thing. The main weapon of the First order is a death star on steroids. But the way the weapon works is taken straight out of Star Trek. This is a criminal offense. Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the movie absolutely out of nowhere. It's like Abrams and Disney were desperate to throw them in there just for nostalgia. Once again out of nowhere Ray figures out she has Jedi powers. The first time it happens is when Luke Skywalker's (who as been explained shortly decided abandon everyone and live in isolation in a place unknown) light-saber suddenly possesses the ability to show her where it's located in exactly the same way like bracelet of Anubis showed to Evelyn it's location in the movie Mummy returns.Also the audience figures out later on that non-Jedi's also can fight with light-sabers when Finn ( not a Jedi ) fight the wimpy Sith Kylo Ren. It's like who needs Jedi's, give a light-saber to a regular Joe and he will fight almost as good as a Jedi who had years of training. There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. Every person who has more than 2 brain cells will know what is going to happen. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love.Conclusion: Because Disney and Abrams decided not to include George Lucas in any way this movie has no Star wars feel and no soul. It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone. They can call it an iPhone as much as they want, but it isn't an iPhone.",1,2788,4304,16 December 2015
