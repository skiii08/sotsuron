Hereditary," Original. Nightmarish. Horrific.
",I was so pleasantly surprised by this movie. So scary and skin crawling. This movie doesnt rely on gore or cheap shock factors. It puts you in the front seat of the family morning losses and dealing with mental illness. Truly one of the best horror movies I've seen in years.,9,0,2,29 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Puke face emoji
","Christ on a cracker...this was bad. Sad to see what the writers have done to this series. It's just terribly dumb and convoluted. The story is awful. I wish I could get my money back and somehow convince at least 1 person not to waste theirs. If I could save just one, it would be worth it. I dont see how this new trilogy has convinced any of the younger generations to jump on board the star wars fanboy train. At this point, they are cinematically comparable to whatever movie Dwayne Johnson has in theaters at any given weekend.",2,7,15,20 December 2019
Aladdin," High school musical, parkour, Aladdin
","My god this movie was crap. Not even Will Smith could save this one. The actors who played the other 3 main roles (Aladdin, Jasmine, and, Jafar) are just horrible at their jobs. For the first 30 min I felt like I was watching a production at my local arts theater. From the CGI animals to the horrible original songs, to the cringe worthy solo number for Jasmine's character, this movie was an abomination and sad. Guy Ritchie used to be amazing but this could be the final nail in his 'sellout ' coffin.",1,4,5,15 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," How does it have a 7.4?
","This movie was terrible, as everyone has stated. My question is, after scrolling through about 20 pages of reviews, all giving it 1,2, or the occasional 3, how the heck does it still have an average of a 7.4 user review?",2,467,608,18 March 2019
It Chapter Two," Disappointment and 45 minutes to long
","I mean there are scary parts, as to be expected. But nothing even remotely close to as petrifying as the original. I had high expectations for this movie with it's all star cast but it's sad when you have Bill Hader stealing the limelight from actors like Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy. Seriously though, Bill Hader was great. And besides all that , this movie could have ended 45 minutes earlier. A lot filler and repetition in the end. It got a bit ridiculous with the 'oh you think its over', and cheesy relationship mending and even cheesier 'closure ' scenes.",6,0,0,28 October 2019
