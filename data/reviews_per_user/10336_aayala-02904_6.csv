It," Great remake
","I was a little skeptical at first but was blown away by the performance of skarsgaard and the redirection of this movie. Watch the original, of course. But definitely make time to see this one afterwards. You won't be disappointed. Can't wait for part 2.",10,1,1,11 May 2019
Us," More confusing than anything

Hotel Mumbai," Breathtaking
","This movie truly hits home and stays there. One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Yes, it's violent but what happened there was even worse. This movie did a great job in re-telling such a tragic event.",10,64,183,1 April 2019
