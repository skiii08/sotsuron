The Blair Witch Project," Good idea, bad movie.
","Rarely have I ever wasted 90 minutes as badly as when I watched The Blair Witch Project.  This film is constantly alternating between day and night. There's day, which is of course not at all scary, even when the characters find various artifacts presumably left by the Blair Witch.  The day is mostly used to advance the unusually weak plot.  Then there's night, which is remotely scarier than the day, in that it's dark and the hikers hear strange noises around them.  During the night scenes, as soon as I felt remotely frightened at what might happen, the scene would abruptly switch to day.It is actually just as frightening to hear what this movie is about as it is to watch it, as the film doesn't offer anything beyond its own premise.  If you are scared of darkness, moaning sounds, and college kids, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, you'll be disappointed.",3,0,1,28 March 2000
