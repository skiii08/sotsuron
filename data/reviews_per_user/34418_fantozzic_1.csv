The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," They stole my money!
","This movie was made only for profit!What can I say besides that the acting is very poor and the fact that the whole action could be concentrated in 10 minutes?!?! Nothing happens in this movie!I watched all the parts at cinema, but I promise that I won't even watch the last part at HBO... So, if you haven't managed to see it yet, please don't go to cinema, make the producers go to bankruptcy!This movie doesn't deserve 10 lines of text... Please vote with 1, 7.5 score convinced me to watch it!",1,56,94,21 November 2014
