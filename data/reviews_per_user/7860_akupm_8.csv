Scarface," Scarface
","In my mind, the visual was outstanding such as, colourful cinematography, costume/production designing and beautiful set decoration. My eyes were trapped at how a camera could capture artistic portraits and landscapes. I felt like was staring at a classic painting. The picture made me feel so gripped in. To add, the soundtrack blew me away because of the electronic and club tunes that were played. The film received a groovy tune from it. In addition, the storyline had a gripping touch because of the themes that were explored, for example drug dealing, cultures, morals and finance. I will give Brian De Palma's motion picture a 10/10.",8,0,2,25 June 2014
Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca review: It was a clever picture released in 1942. It explored themes such as slavery, motives, the mind, friendship and the Second World War. The cinematography had it great expose lighting. The portraits of characters were strongly detailed. I loved staring at the costume and production designing. The costumes were appropriate for each character on set. It looked formal. I think the picture deserves a remake like the 1962 film Cape Fear. I felt like Humphrey Bogart had the same role like he does in other noir movies. Michael Curtiz captured the setting of Casablanca beautifully such as the palm trees, architecture and the Arab clothing. I enjoyed the other setting in the title, that was Paris. The French culture was shot in deep detail. You could acknowledge how the French citizens lived and how they suffered during the Second World War. Frequently the story-line is carried out through dialogue. I think you can treasure this movie with a passion. I give it an 8/10",7,0,1,12 January 2014
Training Day," Training Day
","In my thoughts, 'Training Day' had a great visual, such as eye capturing cinematography, street productions and costume desighing. I felt like there were some unnecessary close ups on the fantastic portraits. On the other hand, the balanced cinematography was suitable for each scene. To Add, the title had apprpopiate music for the street theme film, for example electronic and rap smash hits. The soundtrack was played when needed. In addition, the storyline explored youth gang coulture and corruption in communities but it could of dug into a massive picture on the criminal subject matter. The black humour made my face burst into laughter because the dialogue and body language. David Ayer did a brilliant job with the screenplay. I am triggered to giving Antoine Fuqua's directed picture a 7/10.",7,0,0,6 January 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes Of Wrath
",The Grapes of Wrath I believed that the picture was flat because of how the content was choreographed by John Ford. The negative element was that most of the sequences didn't have a strong substance. The black and white footage aggravated the situation; the reason was that the storyline was crumbling like breadcrumbs. As a consequence I lost fascination in the plot. Because of the terrible director the landscapes were matt with the colour. If it was Hitchcock motion picture the Black and White and the directing wouldn't of been an issue. In my opinion the soundtrack was rushing to the drains because of the instruments that were playing worthless chords. But on the other hand some of the camera angles captured quality moments for an example; far distance and sky view. The phycological element in the content was underneath the surface as John Ford's purpose. A few scenes of cinematography were impressive. I give John Ford's motion picture a 2 Â½ /10,Null,1,2,2 December 2013
Disturbia," Disturbia
","Review: The movie was disappointing because the atmosphere wasn't strong enough especially the suspense and tension. Shia La Beouf performed brilliantly but not as well as Morse because you would forget that he was acting. I didn't like the way the film was directed because it didn't drag a strong ingredient from the original picture (Rare Window) that could capture you. The soundtrack was quite poor and I thought the film was just aimed at teenagers because of it themes and the Western culture. The movie didn't focus strongly on other themes like investigation, the main character's upbringing or deeply how the next door serial Killer's motive or reason on slaying people. Instead the film focused too much on teenagers and how they live their lives in the Western culture. Robert Turner played by Morse portrayed his role in a sinister way but he could of performed a lot better because of his potential. I give the picture a 4/10",6,2,4,25 November 2013
American History X," American History X
","In my opinion, the visual was quite disappointing because the cinematography, camera angles/shots, production and costume designing was not outside the box. As a viewer the close ups became very erratic. It ignored decent portraits and landscapes. Tony Kaye's cinematography looked flat instead of mind blowing. Tony Kaye's directing did not look professional. In addition, the plot was down the drain for me because it only explored a very tiny piece of the racial subject matter. David Mckenna's screenplay was absolutely preachy. It did not let the audience have access to their perspectives. In my thoughts, it made the characters behave like puppets instead of organic. Derek Vinyard behaved more like a puppet being pulled by its master than any other normal human being. I hardly felt anything from the storyline because of the lack of depth. I could not empathize with the plot at all. To add, Ann Dudley written down beautiful notes for his orchestra to perform. His composed tunes trapped my ears from beginning to end. I am pushed to give the title a 3/10.",7,2,4,25 November 2013
Prisoners," Prisoners
","In my mind, the visual was brilliant, because my eyes captured the realistic cinematography, artistic camera angles/shots, beautiful portraits and landscapes. The film was like staring into an outstanding painting. Roger Deakins did a fantastic job at making the cinematography look supremely natural. To add, my ears were captured by the acoustic, electronic music and sound effects. It was appropriate tunes for the genre. Johan Jonasson composed the tracks amazingly. In addition, the storytelling deeply explored religious and moral values. I found the plot very disturbing and gripping at the same time.It opened up a psychological dimension. The title triggered me to give it an 8/10, because of its wonderful creativity.",8,1,2,15 June 2014
Taken 2," Taken 2
","In my thoughts, the stylish cinematography was mastered well by Romain Lacourbas. He used different range of colours like a Japanese production. My eyes captured the wonderful Los Angeles, Instanbul, Alabanian and Paris landscape without an ugly rush like some other fast pace action films. The visual was like staring into a painting. The technical challenges such as the quick camera shots was fantastic for the genre of the title. It made the film feel more action packed and tense. To add, the electronic and acoustic soundtrack was beautiful to listen to because the notes were were written and played very well by the orchestra and computer. The soundtrack fitted well in a blockbuster action packed thriller. The sound was absolutely emotive. In addition, the plot was supremely tense and gripping to the extent when I could not keep on track with my heart beats. Luc Beeson and Robert.M Kamen's imaginative script was definitely outside the box. The summary for the film: Bryan Mills reunites with his ex-wife and daughter on their holiday trip to Istanbul. All of a sudden, the family are stalked and hailed at serious danger by the Albanian Mafia who seek revenge. What makes me love 'Taken 2' is the fact that it related to the first movie but the only difference was that Kim Mills played by (Maggie Grace) had to return the favour by saving her father from dangerous Albanian mobsters who hailed him and his wife hostage in a secret location. It was horrifying to know the fact that Bryan and his wife Lenore were kidnapped and hailed hostage in a warehouse by the Albanian criminals. Not only that but 'Taken 2' was more brutal and less sensitive like 'Taken 1'. It soaked the movie with the thrill of tense bloody violent sequences like foot and car chases, massive shoot outs and explosions. The screenplay sucked in the theme family values and how the Albanians and the Mills' fought for their honour and survival. In my interpretation, Istanbul was a great place to shoot an action movie because of the Islamic culture, caved buildings, narrow alley ways and other Islamic elements which connects with architecture and culture. As a conclusion, I will give Oliver Megaton's directed picture an 8/10.",3,5,7,18 June 2014
