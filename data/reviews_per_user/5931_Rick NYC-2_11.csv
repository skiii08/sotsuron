Requiem for a Dream," captures the nightmare
","This is a dream piece, and while there is a linear exposition of a plot, the way to enjoy it is to take it for what it is, a dream, or a spook-house ride. Dreams have a staccato, flanging progression, with big, loud highs and ominous languid lows. The feel of a long unending nightmare is achieved superbly, with characters as caricatures, sensations as icons exploding, and time warped at roller coaster pace, with, not incidentally, the Coney Island Cyclone as constant backdrop. I'm not sure I approve of all those Wasp actors portraying Brighton Beach Jews, as it did draw attention to the fact that we were watching something put on and unreal, but even that is not inconsistent with the quality of nightmares. The point that we are all addicts, in one way or another, is well made, and the dream, despite its amusement park ridiculousness, is always a bit too real. Burstyn deserves a special Oscar for allowing herself to look like death in such horrific close-ups.",Null,0,0,3 December 2000
Unbreakable," Almost as good as Sixth Sense
","It will be hard to live up to the now mythic success of Sixth Sense, but Unbreakable delivers in most of the ways its predecessor did. There are few Hollywood pyrotechnics, but there is deeply felt emotion, suspense, wonder, and, ultimately, surprise. There's a cast you care about, and a lot to think about on the walk back home. That's a lot these days.",Null,1,1,26 November 2000
Monster," I totally lost it
","By the time the movie was over, I was sobbing. Maybe because I knew Michael Alig, another 'monster' who fell from grace, but I don't think you have to have a friend who became a murderer to be deeply touched by Theron's amazing Oscar-winning performance (you can bet grandma's farm on this one; sorry, Diane). Bring a handkerchief. If you don't need to use it, shame on you.",10,0,0,4 January 2004
Alexander," The movie emphasizes brain over brawn
","Don't go looking for three hours of blood and guts. The Greeks were philosophers and there is lots of talk, about everything from moral virtue to sin, to greed and hubris, friendship and love...you get the idea. People who liked Humanities and Contemporary Civilization in college will like this film a lot more than people whose idea of a good time is three hours of Mel Gibson causing bloody havoc. The battle scenes, while gory, are not as explicit as many blood-and-guts fans might be hoping for. Then, the male-male romance was tough on a lot of young guys on dates with their girlfriends. There were lots of nervous titters from young men. This film is ground-breaking, and for those who haven't come to terms with the fact of our universal innate bisexuality (re-read your Freud), it can be troubling. See this film in a trendy neighborhood with highly educated snobs, especially gay ones. You'll be a lot happier.",Null,6,8,26 November 2004
About Time," A happy little tearjerker that presses all your buttons
","10 stars! About Time is the Ultimate chick flick. The love match between Tim and Mary, Domhnall ('DOUGH-i-null') Gleeson and Rachel McAdams, will be a thing of legend. They are not A- list heartthrobs like Pitt and Jolie, but their off-beat adorableness makes them lovable and relatable. We, ourselves, with proper diet and exercise, could possibly be as lovely as they are. So we identify with them from the get-go.The gag is that Tim and all the men in this family have a special gift of being able to go back in their own past just by wishing to do it (but not the historic past--only the past that they are personally part of) whenever they feel the need to, so that they can redo things, to correct anything that went wrong. Sound familiar? Yes, this is definitely a rip off of Groundhog Day, and some purists may find it to be an artistic no-no to borrow from a film so beloved, but it's not exactly the same because they don't only redo the same day. They can go back to their childhood, or yesterday. Of course, as with all time-travel movies, we have to avoid asking any of those annoying 'Butterfly' questions about screwing up world reality, or the reality of what is in the time traveler's mind after he comes back from changing the past. Like what else changed in between? But Tim never changes anything too far back, or world shattering--mostly recent little things, like changing the way he talked to a girl or moving strategically to a different room in order to avoid meeting somebody.There are two major relationships in this movie: the boy-girl love affair, and the father and son's mutual adoration. We may cry a lot--not for them, but for ourselves, thinking, maybe unconsciously, how much better we wish our father-son relationships were/had been. Boy oh boy! Tim and Dad hug a lot and even kiss and we love them for it. If we can get past our own pain. Dad doesn't use his time travel power to make a killing in the stock market. (His uncle got filthy rich and ended up miserable and alone.) No, Dad goes back to summer afternoons so that he can read more of the classics than it's humanly possible to read in a normal life time. He's a retired professor. (How did he buy that house? Old money?)There is one little beef I have with this idyllic tale. This is a privileged family of leisure, with a small mansion on the beach, and they don't have seem to have any of the problems that we huddled masses have (except for the relentless march of time that we are all subject to). They are White, thin, healthy, comfortable, well employed (Tim goes to London to become a lawyer), and they are all able to enjoy games of tennis and walks on the beach and seemingly without any stress from one another or the outside world. Okay, the daughter drinks a bit too much, but the family remains loving and happy like the Nelsons or the Cleavers. (Sorry for the old reference. I'm 62.)This privileged life allows Tim to worry about girls without being troubled by all the nuisances that may bother the rest of us. And the two leads are so infectiously adorable, and their friends and colleagues are so much fun, that we go on the ride that sails by like a dream. It's a cinematic delight, with beach landscapes, cliffs, the ocean, beautiful homes and apartments in both London and Cornwall, and parties filled with lovely furnishings and sexy lads and lasses. The two lead actors are top-notch, and so is Bill Nighy as Dad. They are so invested in one another, so we smile, we laugh, we get misty-eyed, we cry, and finally, we sob if we are not afraid to, over their triumphs, joys, infatuations, loves, and the pains that even the privileged are occasionally heir to.I'm glad I watched it at home, alone, because I dread coming apart--like I did--in a crowded theater. I imagine that many manly young men will slake this movie because of how expertly, and relentlessly, it presses one's buttons. But I, for one, think Richard Curtis is a genius, and I'm glad he pressed mine.",Null,3,4,20 November 2015
Cast Away," I wanted to see more of Helen Hunt
","I think the drama at the end of the picture would have been enhanced if we had occasionally been given a look at what Hunt (Hanks's fiancee) was going through while Hanks was on the island. I can't discuss specifics without spoiling here, but we learn about Helen Hunt's agonizing decisions only after Hanks gets back to civilization. It would have been more interesting for me to see what she was going through parallel to, and intercut with, what Hanks was dealing with on his island. I think the failure to do so accounts for my being able to leave the theater dropping only a few tears, instead of spouting a gusher.",Null,0,0,28 December 2000
Seabiscuit," tea biscuit
","I thought it was kind of bland. Forgive me, but I felt like it was a McFilm. If Adobe had software for making Oscar-style movies about horses, and you simply had to plug in all the variables, a big rich horse owner with a good heart, a poor little feisty jockey with a good heart, a big poor wise horse trainer with a good heart, a feisty little horse with a good heart, a big fat other horse owner with not such a good heart with a big black horse to beat, and a lot of fall foliage, this is the movie that it would pump out. But software is only as good as the data that goes into it. I'm sorry, but I feel like robots could have made this film. It was lovely to watch but I wasn't moved. Perhaps if the humans had been allowed to have frailties and foibles slightly more complex than the horse's, I would have gotten involved in the film, but I didn't shed any tears despite all the obvious cues by the music, camera shots, and script that were asking me to have specific moments of catharsis. For the same ten bucks, I could have had the fortune cookie telling me not to give up on underdogs and a whole chow fun dinner on top of it.",Null,0,0,6 August 2003
The Da Vinci Code," A waste of time and money
","Tom Hanks should get an Oscar for pretending he was in a movie. I can't believe this dull turkey is still selling out. It can't possibly be getting good word of mouth. Maybe it's okay for someone who hasn't read the book and doesn't know what is going to happen. Maybe finding out what's going to happen is reward enough. But for someone who has read the book, there are no other attractions to the film. There is no serious excitement, suspense, emotion, love interest, action, cinematography, acting, social message, or anything else that makes a movie worth lining up for. It might have been more interesting if they had concentrated on the historical events leading up to the present and made it a saga of the activities of the Roman Catholic church from the time of Constantine, through the Holy Roman Empire, then the Crusades, then the plague, then the renaissance, then the industrial age, and finally the last century. If they had done that, with lots of context and verisimilitude, then it might have been intriguing and exciting. As it turns out, the flash backs were low-budget scenes like the kind you see in cheesy History Channel documentaries. Maybe I'm disappointed because I had just seen Sir Ian in X-Men, and I expected that anything he would do with Tom Hanks would have to be even better. Well, I guess even Opie is entitled to sleep walk through a certain percentage of projects. Let's just hope he takes Viagra and not Ambien for the next one.",1,2,6,29 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," not for the kiddies
","We middled-aged Harry Potter fans loved it, but the nine-year-old godson fidgeted throughout. It has lots of exposition and dialog, and the action sequences were downright dark and creepy. Mr. Fiennes, as Voldemort, will give me nightmares for years to come.The romance angle was charming, and Hermione has turned into a gorgeous young woman, doing a Cinderella turn in the ballroom scene. Master Radcliffe shows off his torso in a naughty bathtub scene with the girl ghost. Clearly, these three kids are going to be a bit old when it comes time to play 17-year-olds in Movie 7. Only some extraordinary witchcraft in the make-up department will allow these young adults to come off as teenagers in a few years' time.Already, it was a bit of a stretch to buy Harry as only 14 years of age in this one, but it wasn't impossible, so this outing was by far the most successful rendition of Rowling's words. I'd call it a masterpiece.",10,1,2,20 November 2005
A Beautiful Mind," I'm a bit disappointed
","Perhaps the Oscar hype made me expect something that would knock my socks off, but I thought I should have at least needed to take my handkerchief out. I didn't feel that the schizophrenia was presented with enough background. Usually, hallucinations grow out of something in the person's life, but we don't learn anything about Nash's life. He is just dropped into Princeton without any history (or family), so it's a bit hard to care deeply about his descent into madness. The love story was also a bit thin; it was not clear what made Nash endearing that someone would sacrifice so much for him. Then there's the problem with mathematics. All of it is presented as extremely important to geniuses, but it can't be explained to us, so all we get is a lot of blackboards and windows coated with symbols we must assume mean something. At least with psychotic pianists, we can understand why the music is important and the love of their life. But math? Once the story turns into an after-school special about sticking by crazy people because they are gifted and deserve our love, I felt that the movie had become an excellent made-for-TV product, but an Oscar film? I guess this was one of the worst years for movies in history, and the hype about this film is the proof; pardon the mathematical allusion.",Null,0,1,16 February 2002
Gladiator," two movies for the price of one
","There is the drama, very Shakespearean in nature, with the complexities of power, betrayal, loyalty, love of king, family and country; and then there is the action. The movie has the feel of a committee behind it. The screenplay probably didn't specify too much about the battles, both military and gladiatorial, and somebody along the way probably decided that that the movie was too sophisticated and dramatic to sell without a lot of violence. The battles and fights are not particularly ingenious. I was never grossed out to the degree I had hoped for; I was rarely in suspense, and I didn't find the action to be specific enough. I wasn't always sure what specifically was happening in a fight. The violence didn't measure up to the politics in the drama. That said, the drama was fine, and Joaquin Phoenix held his own as the evil Commodus, and Mr. Crowe will get another crack at an Oscar. The story, by the way, is a flight-of-fancy, taking off from the more boring history, which is that Marcus Aurelius chose Maximus over his own son, Commodus, to rule Rome, but Commodus had Maximus (and his brother Condianus) assassinated after an early attempt was made on his life, orchestrated by his jealous sister Lucilla. Lucilla was exiled (later killed) and many suspected enemies (Maximus among them) were also assassinated. That wouldn't have made a very good movie, so we start by having Maximus show disrespect for Commodus on his first day in office, which causes Commodus to have him assassinated, the attempt of which he escapes miraculously. Lucilla remains in the story as a weak, sniveling (possibly incestuous) hanger on, and the historical fact that she was a power hungry conniver herself is conveniently excluded so that she can stay in the story till the end. In real life, Commodus was finally poisoned by a favorite concubine (Marcia) with the assistance of the palace staff, who were all afraid that they might be next in Commodus's paranoid rampage of executions. In addition, Gibbon (Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire) tells us that Commodus was much like Caligula in his taste both for assassinating his potential enemies and for orgies with both boys and women. That sexual side was not in the movie. I sorely longed for Bob Guccione's presence. Finally, only a small reference is made to the fact that Commodus fancied himself a great gladiator, calling himself the Roman Hercules. His servants concocted fixed 'battles' with (drugged) wild beasts and (drugged or disabled) gladiators that he would always win. The crowd, according to Gibbon, found this display of vanity a bit annoying, but the thing that made the people really mad was that he was simply killing too many people. People will tolerate a lot from an emperor, but not the possibility that they will be his next victim.",8,0,0,14 May 2000
