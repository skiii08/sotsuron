Vertigo," Exciting when it counts
","The movie starts slow and builds, builds damn well Hitchcock captures my attention when the plot is solved and keeps me glued to the screen wanting more answers. But does he give it? not all of it which keeps me guessing, and which keeps other critics guessing.Meaning, my guess can be better than yours, and vice versa, so the interpretation of this film (filmwise) can be very subjective, but nothing to fight and debate about. Ultimately the focus of film should be the literal film itself and what is being shown in the big screen and not the meaning or the interpretation. Script was excellent, lovable and amusing. Acting except for the kissing in the beginning part, maybe coz I wasn't the guy of that time, I just thought that the kissing was bad, James Stewart didn't know how to kiss the beautiful lady that well, it was a little awkward for me. But as the film continued it got better.Cinematography was very good, didn't realize San Francisco was that amazing, before I die I want to visit that bridge and maybe go for a swim, hoping someone will save me. ^^Music was mysteriously amusing, and Im guessing it didn't take that much money to make this film, and yet it was good. The techniques in editing wasn't to complex, because it didn't need to be, and because this film is pretty old. I loved Hitchcock playing with colors and that really drived the point home.",9,5,8,25 May 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Jack Black and his AWESOMENES!!!
","Well if your looking for a good time this movie is definitely for you..The animation, CGI is done so well that even if I'm 20 i feel like an 8 year old watching a movie.The humor made me laugh but more than that there was meaning and depth into the dialogue which makes this film a classic. The voice of Jack Black paired up well with Po the Panda giving the movie a genuine feel.'There are no accidents' And me giving this movie a 9 ain't no accident! ENJOY!!",9,4,5,18 June 2008
The Dark Knight," For those who didn't like it...........
","Reading some of the comments I was surprised to find quite a few people that didn't find this film all that good...Their arguments was mainly the plot holes and the screening time.... (Or, just my opinion they wanted to counter flow all the praises that this film is getting... There are always those critics who just want to go the other direction)Well to say the least this is not enough to put a film down....I have to agree there was some inconsistencies in the plot and some of them were unrealistic but you have to get it in your freaking brain that this is a comic/fiction/fantasy film... Batman does not exist or will never exist in real life, as well as the joker (scary dude).... With this said the script writers could have done anything they wanted to do even make batman fight with bats or make joker strip naked or whatever..... Instead they have created a fantasy that cannot be judged in the micro level but has to be seen in the macro level of things..... and damn right did the macro hit me hard, with the lessons you can learn from good and evil, the film was deep, meaningful and artistic.... If your soooo annoyed like a little kid that the film didn't go according to plan or didn't go your way then i believe the directors purposely did it to annoy you, and grabbed the hearts of the more intellectual and emotional audience..... Secondly the running time, well yes it was long, but it was long for a purpose.. It obviously follows that if you didn't like the script in the first place and thought that you were all so smart and knew what was going on it is natural for you to feel that this movie is long... so to add this to another reason why you don't like this film is just a waste of time an pointless...That said I agree to all the comments that were on the more positive light... I cannot name them all, but man this movie was something else... And to those who didn't like it, your answers are somewhere above along those lines.... Believe me I would argue with you anytime.... The Dark Night rocks!!!! RIP heath!!",9,9,19,14 August 2008
Hancock," Not Great, Not Bad
","Im personally a big Will Smith Fan so I was expecting more than the average audience.The acting per se wasn't bad, but let me just say the story got me kind of confused.The whole 2 being one and them coming from way back in time just dint work for me.Perhaps the script writers took a comedy film too seriously at the end.It would have been better if it was a no brainer entertainment film from beginning to finish.They gave too much for the actors to handle and in the end it just let me hanging and made me watch another movie right away, WANTED.",6,2,6,3 July 2008
WALL·E," Eve....
","This film really hit me, even though I watched this film right after I watched Batman begins at 1:30 AM, I must say I was up all night...There was no 'bad' in this film, and the message it brings whatever one may think truly brings reflection to the human kind....Music was great, and the animation was as real as animation can get... I just really loved when Wall-E said Eve.... It was really cute and touched my heart...... I think its about time that human beings get up their lazy bums and start to look into the future... And it is also about time to get a girl like Eve or a guy like Wall E in your life... What matters most is not development or progress but a genuine reflection...You can watch this film blind or deaf and it will still be good!!! Imagine that...I wanted to shout in this summary so bad but IMDb wont let me... which sucks... any ways all the periods are exclamation points...Oh just found I cant write all caps coz thats considered shouting! but if i had the chance I would definitely write all caps!and btw eve should really be written all caps coz it deserves it!!! and now im really shouting!!! lolz",9,0,2,14 August 2008
300," Overanalyzed
","There are so many people that want to put this film down, but in the end there are more people who like it than the people who don't.Thus, this tells us that the majority of human beings liked this film and with good reason.I personally like the use of the slow motion, it gave more depth to the objects that were being portrayed in the film. (some people apparently don't like it at all), the worst part is they try to convince others that it is bad...... which is utterly wrong, becomes ultimately it comes down to TASTE/PREFERENCE.The acting was good(again some people think its ******) but honestly, for me that is how a spartan is supposed to act in my imagination.The dialogue they say is cheesy, and yes perhaps but it is cheesy with meaning, it is clichés that work and fits well with the film.Cinematography and visual effects cannot be done better. People tend to agree with me on this one.There is a weak plot and character development, and I agree with this point, but its that good that it doesn't need a plot or character development and still it worked for me. Perhaps the people who always need to have crazy plots and philosophies in films shouldn't watch this film because they will not genuinely understand the nature of this film and its goal and be irritated with what they expect. GOSH THIS FILM IS NOT TARKOVSKY OR ERICE! After all this said if this film suits your imagination than it will be good to watch, if not then you will hate it to death.But still the whole film is simple and neatly done.Its not supposed to be historically accurate, its a FILM for god sake that follows a comic book.I believe that people who really hate this film think they are smart film viewers or critics who think they know a little about movies and films in general. I say you cannot compare apples with oranges, and I say this apple was a darn good one.",9,0,1,25 May 2008
