Angels & Demons," If you liked the book, DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE!
","If you liked the book, don't bother with the movie! Little Opie Cunningham should be ashamed of what he did to this book! 'Angels and Demons' is, arguably, Dan Brown's best book. Ron Howard turned it into a blatant Hollywood capitalization. He killed the spirit of the story. He took out complete scenes, which were essential to plot and character development. He took out complete characters, only to realize later that they were necessary for plot development. Then he had to add new characters back in to get the plot to stay on track. He took out complete actions sequences. He took all of the character out of the Killer. He turned him into a milk-toast hired gun instead of the dedicated true believer that he always was. Come on. This whole movie watches like a rush job that they had to dumb-down for greater mass appeal. When all they really did was alienate all Dan Brown fans!",1,1,3,27 November 2009
