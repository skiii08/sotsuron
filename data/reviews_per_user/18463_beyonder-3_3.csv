The Incredible Hulk," Hulk at his best!
","This is what a Hulk movie is supposed to be! This movie has all the action you can expect from a character like the Hulk, without turning into a mindless movie. I thought Edward Norton did a OK job being Banner, and has the advantage of being similar to the comic's Bruce Banner, than Eric Bana is. Tim Roth is also good in is role as Emil Blonsky. I didn't hate Ang Lee movie but it was too slow for a movie with a green giant monster being chased by the military.I can only expect that a sequel to this movie eventually comes out, because all of the ingredients to make another excellent action packed movie are there. So if you're expecting a complex story with great roles this is not your movie, but if you like action movies and especially if you are a Hulk fan you will not be disappointed. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,17 September 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Solid action movie!
","First thing to know if you're new to the Fast and Furious movies is that there are some unrealistic action sequences. So if you have a problem with that don't waste your time. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good action movie without giving to much credit to those scenes then you're up for a kick ass time with Fast and Furious 6. The characters are very good and keeping 'The Rock' on the movie is very positive. I think he makes a great duo with Vin Diesel. The story isn't very elaborate, and that's the way it should be in this type of movie, but it deliver's. Fast and Furious 6 is one of the best action movies around these days, so give it a shot. 7 out of 10 !",6,0,2,17 September 2013
The Purge," Nothing special here!
","I wasn't expecting a masterpiece when i decided to watch this movie, but i expected something better than this.The concept is interesting but in my opinion the story just doesn't delivers. It's just stupid that a guy who sells security systems for a living, get's his house invaded with almost no effort by the bad guys. In a reality that people know when crimes are going to be committed, they just don't take all the precautions they should. I mean, wouldn't it be simpler to just build a panic room? It's harder to get in than his house!!And you wouldn't have the problem of someone opening the doors. There's some good moments in the movie but not enough to make this worth watching unless you have nothing to do and no more movies to see. I give it a 5 out of 10.",5,1,2,18 September 2013
