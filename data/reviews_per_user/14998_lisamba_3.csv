Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good movie
","I took 6 teens to this movie and we all enjoyed it. I was a little weary when they had a preacher character in it whether there was going to be some cursing against God but it was all done in good taste. They have a little voodoo in it, but not bad. And of course they have skeletons and Zombie type of people but they just have a lot of scares on the face. This was not too scary for me(I get scared easy). The mermaids could be a little scary to kids with vampire like fangs. This was a fun movie to watch and not to scary. They film part in England and most of it in Hawaii. I wish I knew how they did some of the trick on the screen because some are really cool.",9,2,4,29 May 2011
La La Land," So Boring!
","I saw this movie on the airplane and it was so boring, it wasn't the dancing that was boring or the singing but the script. The movie just dragged on with no real story to follow. The dancing was o.k. the singing was o.k. but the story was not there, I finally ended up changing movies because after a hour or more it should have plot or some sort of goal. It was just a sorry guy with no motive and girl who been hurt and gets more hurt and after that I lost interest, too bad it seemed like a promising movie but the script was just a very sorry story and boring.",1,12,18,1 May 2017
Casino Royale," Not a good James Bond movie
","This movie I think was really bad. It was very volient, no cool gadgets, sense of humor was not even there(in some of the movies they have little sense of humor) And his speaking voice was hard to understand. I don't understand how some people say this is close to the James Bond. None of the James Bond were this volient before and there was no cool gadgets to help him be the secret agent. This new Bond I thought was too old and ugley(sorry) Has too many wrinkles he looks 50 or so. The story lines was pretty good but I don't think that they had to be as volient in the torcher as they were. I think they need a better looking Bond, more gadgets, someone who can speak clearly and not mumble their words and to tone down the volience. I hope the other James Bond movies are better because if they are like this from now on this will be my last James Bond movie.",3,6,9,8 April 2007
