The New World," A true piece of art
","'The New World' is a movie like no other. You cannot look upon it or compare it to just a regular film. It is so much more than that. It is a true piece of art!! Terrence Malick is a genius in film-making an delivers us a truly unique movie-experience in this uncommonly well made movie. He gives us a rare sense of humanity and love and displays naked feelings vividly and honestly to us, letting us feel them ourselves, without the use of worn-out clich√©'s. With amazing footage, powerful music and very sharp editing, he manages to say so very many things with the use of so very few words. Outstanding and utterly beautiful! This movie may though not suit everyone. It is extremely special and you need to have a mature viewing-eye and patience, in addition to the ability to give yourself to the story and the experience of it. You have to appreciate movies not just as mere entertainment, but also as the works of arts - sometimes abstractly tilted - they can be. If you open your eyes, sit back, relax and take in the power and majesty, this movie will astound you, letting you leave the room having grown on the rich experience it gives, if you let it.'The New World' is a wonderful film, that carries with it the segregation of the public, ultimately showing us the true movie-lovers!",10,4,9,24 March 2006
