Minority Report," Don't diss the ending, diss other things
","SPOILERS HEREIN, Beware!------This may have been said before, but for those of you who find the ending way too cute and perfect it may be worthwhile to consider some things that Tim Blake Nelson's character utter before lowering Anderton into his watery prison. Things to the effect that a stay in the 'prison' supposedly can be a real mind trip where 'your whole life flashes before your eyes, and your dreams come true'. Together with the rather drastic change of tone which follows this part of the film, it seems likely that Spielberg has left the field open to suppose that everything that happens after this may well all be dreams of Anderton's.
Granted, the film does not become perfect from this alone, but it seems unfair (as in the case af A.I.) to take up the Spielberg-always-destroys-his-films-with- happy-endings' chant.",Null,0,0,25 February 2003
