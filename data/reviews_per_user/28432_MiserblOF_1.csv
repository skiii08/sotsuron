Casablanca," Simply, 'The Greatest.'
","I haven't looked at the IMDb list of the 'best', but the idea of 'Casablanca' being FIFTH is preposterous. This is, without a doubt, the most perfect movie ever made. The only criticism that might make any sense at all would be that when compared with modern films, it doesn't have great special effects. But then, it's not a 'special effects' picture, and the cardboard cutout airplane with midgets working on it was a stroke of genius in itself.The story of the making of the movie that appears on the DVD is very interesting- the plot evolving during the shooting, writers coming and going and coming back again, the last minute (and beyond) work on the ending.The cast is outstanding, the sets are perfect, everything about this timeless classic works. Watching this film, to me, is an almost religious experience into the capabilities of the human species to use fiction to show the best and worst that we humans can be. And they almost gave the lead male role to REAGAN? Number FIVE? Give me a break.",10,0,2,16 May 2006
