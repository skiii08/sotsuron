The Avengers," Horrific misuse of Hollywood resources and time
","The Avengers is simply the epitome of how bad Marvel and Hollywood have become in the past decade. If you combine terrible acting (Chris Hemsworth as an example), shocking green-screen and a massive clump of fan-boy superheroes with Hollywood eye-candy, you get 'The Avengers'. Joss Wheadon's career is now over whether you Marvel fan-boys like it or not. The storyline is so poorly constructed that it lets you instead 'gaze in wonder' at a cliché alien invasion, a cliché bad guy and a cliché wonder device (Tesseract). I can say no more, get over it fan-boys, a mass of your favourite superheroes in one movie DOES NOT WARRANT AN 8.2 RATING!!!!! I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY THE SEQUEL CAUSE IM NOT WASTING MY MONEY ON SUCH GARBAGE!",1,6,30,11 July 2014
