Mission: Impossible III," Mission Accomplished
","Its a mindless(w.r.t MI-1) styles(w.r.t MI-2) action movie. But is it fair to compare, a Big NO. JJ Adams has got every thing in a perfect blend (story!?). A movie which is overflowing with action from the first frame to the credits. The stunts are choreographed brilliant and fast paced. Too much of every thing might also go wrong but you will never get that feeling throughout the movie. Its a perfect action movie. M:I-3 is a neat film when it stands alone in the action gene. But if seen as a part of trilogy surely something is missing.Tom has done a neat job, though he looks old on screen he is apt for the role. I liked Villain was the most adorable in the movie apart from the Orange care which was blown away. A must watch movie for every action buff. Heard that China has cut down the violent scenes from the movie, I don't know what will remain after this censor Title or Credit?",8,0,0,14 June 2006
50 First Dates," Oops! I for got the title of the movie
","This is one popcorn chewing movie where you can relax without any great attention of whats going in the film. Adam Sandler plays the lead role with the pretty Drew Barrymore.What will you do if the girl you proposed is suffering from a temporary memory problem, that is she forgets every thing that happens on that day after she goes to the bed.That's what Adam goes through in the film with Drew. He repeatedly make her fall in love with him every day. The film has nice comedy but not a trademark Adam Sandler movie. The location looks exotic. Still it makes you smile and cry at the end of the film.+ drew & Adam and comedy<ul><li>story is weak and sometimes it is frustrating</li></ul>",5,0,1,29 November 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," What's done is done
","After getting his hand green with Shrek Andrew Adamson(director) this time comes up with an adventure which is so pounding in emotion and cheer. C.S.Lewis's book has been adapted on the screen, i haven't read the book but the movie looks flawless. So much is there for the kids. Since the backdrop is taken as the World War II, the story also reflects the situation that England went through in that period of the time. The children look cute and brave in the movie. Those who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter will surely enjoy the movie.Without taking credit away from the cinematographer, the Visual Effects are stunning in the movie. The Lion looks magnificent, one thing to note here is no actual Lion was used in the film but it looked so real the the actual one. What about the movie as the whole? In the words of Aslan(the name of the Lion) what's done is done. Don't forget to get ready for the next one The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.",7,0,0,26 February 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Father Vs. Mother Nature for his Son
","The movie begins in Antarctic where a huge crack occurs whats surprising is the there is no water below that ice. Then at the global warming meeting in NEW DELHI our hero Dr.Hall (Dennis Quaid) explains his theory about the changing climate and says that an ICE AGE can be seen in another 100 yrs. But what happens next is what the film is all about. The predictions made by him takes effect immediately and the result is multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age.The result of this is the entire northern hemisphere is turned in to ice up to the head of the statute of liberty and ships coming into Manhattan city is captured beautifully on camera. Between this is a small sentimental touch (INDIAN STYLE) between the son Sam (Gyllenhaal) and the father (Dennis). Sam is in N.Y and hall is in D.C and the journey of a father to rescue his son is the rest of the story.Directed by Roland Emmerich the director who gave us THE INDEPENDENCE DAY decides to choose the biggest villain nature. The fight of a FATHER Dennis quaid against the MOTHER nature for rescuing his SON gyllenhaal is a family action adventure.Another important man to notice is ueli steiger the man behind the camera and the visual effects crew.I saw the film with my friend and when we left the theater guess what it was RAINING !!!!!!!!!!!!",7,0,0,29 November 2005
Crash," Crashed in the Right Spot
","Racism, that's always been a problem in America. Its no more a secret, every body knows it and Crash makes sure it brings out the exact feel and the mood of the situation. It does not over play it neither it is under played. The screenplay is perfect it has a brilliance in it to stand out and even though i have not seen the rest of the film that's was in contention for the Oscar i feel this deserve one and go with the jury. It has a big star-cast in it starting from Sandra Bullock to Arnold(in a photo), everybody is apt in their role the casting is perfect.Matt Dillon who was nominated for Supporting Actor, even though his performance is too good in the film i don't think he deserves a nomination. His role was so short in the movie that you don't even feel he is there in the movie, this is not for his character alone but every other character in the movie is treated the same way. Some scenes are very intense in the movie that even you are not part of the system you feel the pain and specially the scene when the Persian guy shoots the little girl.The film moves smoothly from the title to the credit, the shifting of one shot/scene to the other is really well handled. The editor might deserve it for his work but still i have not seen the others to conclude but his work is neat. The question if this film deserves an Oscar, well i think the jury might have gone with the issue that has been dealt in the film rather than the box office collection, which is a good thing and will be leading to the making of more meaning full film. So Crash of course had crashed in the right spot.",7,0,5,16 March 2006
The Village," Horror w/o Devil, Suspense w/o Secret and Killing w/o Blood
","Hello friends this is the 6th film from M.N.Shayamalan(MNS)(namma ooru karan - hails from India) as you know?! this time also you don't find a particular thing in his movie STO.....RY?! that's what my friend said after seeing the movie.But hey guys this is MNS movie you don't go for story. The way of narrating the entire film while having a thin line of story is his brilliance. Though not as THE SIXTH SENSE he has done a reasonably good job.There is HORROR with out a PAYE (devil), There is SUSPENSE with out SECRET, and KILLING with out BLOOD. The master (MNS) has shown his brilliance all the way, to the extent that he is movie but you cannot spot him. I am not going to tell the story that's for you to check out.But I suggest you to see the film in the theater because you have to feel the movie as it is. other than this is has a good CINEMATOGRAPHY, BACKGROUND SCORE and some good performance from PHOEINEX, ADRIAN BRODDY and WEAVER (the alien girl? women!).",8,0,1,29 November 2005
Van Helsing," Van Hell Raising
","Van Helsing is the new super hero in the series of many who have made it to the big screen, who fights against the evil in the name of god. The title role played by Huge Jackman (x-men) is really fitting wile Kate Beckinsale (pearl harbor) also matches him in every step, fist and kick.The story is pretty simple BAD vs GOOD. But, here the good and the bad both are admirable. The director Steven Sommers (the mummy & mummy returns) has done a excellent job of making all the evil characters as cousins to each other and the way the director has conceived and taken the fight sequence is actually SUPERB.The phase of the movie is on the mercury rise from the frame it starts to the end. The special effects is also an important aspect of the film as you will find in the previous movies of Sommers.Completely an action film which can be seen along with your family, well as a matter of fact all super heroes film can be seen along with your family isn't.",5,1,2,29 November 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-citement Short Lived
","X-citment was the word that i was looking out in this movie and a X-Men fan will not no disappointed (at least to an extent) out of the hall. The film opens in a nice manner builds up beautifully and a emotional ending. There is something for every one in the movie. But the only disappointment is the scarcity of the stock. I mean the story had every bit to make it a 3hr saga, but i don't know why the final episode is so short that you are left with a feeling that literally every character looks like they are making a guest appearance. Brett Ratner has done a good job with almost all the character, but still the rush to finish the movie could have been avoided. May be its blessing as well cause the movie is short and right on the money you don't feel lost or start comparing the earlier episodes with this one. The special effects is beautiful as usual, even though the characters are short lived they are well crafted to fit in the right proportion. Hugh Jackman had a big role to play and he does it with ease, his actions is well crafted specially the one in the jungle. Halle Berry looks pretty and i like her style of walk in the movie. Ian McKellen is beyond word as he does the job with so ease that you can't even think of some one else playing this character. Juggernaut, Angel and the Boy who is the cure has been used more than little in the movie, while they had lot of potential to be used more. I liked the Mystique in the movie (specially after the cure ;-) The final fight with Famke Janssen as Phoenix and Magneto and others were excellent and nicely choreographed. I enjoyed X-III very much only disappointment was the length of the movie and scarcity of the action sequences. Hope they reconsider the title 'The Last Stand' cause i think we need few more in this series. To me this movies is X-citement short lived (lenght of the movie)",7,0,1,23 June 2006
Saw," A smooth Saw
","I saw saw and i couldn't believe what i saw in saw. Well, the film was also similar to what i just said now, it was clear in what it was trying to say yet lot tweaks. Its great because the suspense in the movie is revealed only when the credits roll. Excellent in the way the whole movie moves, right from the beginning. The sets was apt and the ideas of the story writer was truly psychic. The make-up was good and the background score was apt. I liked the way the characters getting revealed in scene after scene. The concept was good, fresh and new. Performance was fine by all. One among the best suspense/thriller movie i have ever seen, saw gets 8 stars cause most of the film now a days fail to thrill you sparing few of them. Nobody is a stranger any more after you see this film, thats is the world is too small for the other person to be a stranger. This SAW is too smooth still you will love it.",8,0,1,29 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter and Fill in the Blanks
","After the disappointing prisoner of Azkaban (Harry's earlier version) The Goblet of fire is a welcome sign taking the fact the installment from JKR (the author) is still spending. All credit to the director for making it a perfect entertainer. The cinema hall was filled with children from all age group, one that remembered me of my school days. The 2 best in the series so far after the Sorcerer's Stone.From the opening frame the director had made it very clear to keep it very simple and look exotic, well he has achieved it. Even though there was a lot of opportunity for making it as suspense, thriller with the (Brendan Gleeson) Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Mood character, the director has taken a safe route of comedy with all the character. Probably this version of Harry is the darkest and the funniest so far.As far as the story is concerned (except for those who have read the book) is a mere fill in the blank till we get the final episode. This will fall in the series of The Matrix Reloaded (part 2) were every thing in the movie looks good to enjoy but ultimately they turn out to be just for making it a 2hr film (sorry for being so rude).Three things in the movie that needs to appreciated are the cinematography and special effects as usual and the third thing is of course the dialog for keeping it simple and funny. For those who don't read the books (that's a big crime  and I am the first accused) the film will definitely be a perfect entertainer.",8,0,0,28 November 2005
Cinderella Man," Title or Turtle
","Cinderella Man, Ron + Russell once again team up for yet another Biography this time about Jim Braddock. The movie is all about courage of Jim (Russell) to make things happen in spite of million fingers pointing him saying you cant.There is a dialogs in the movie, where a reporter asks Jim (Russell) what will you take home after winning the Heavy weight Title, Jim replies his children misunderstood Title with Turtle so even he didn't win the title he will be going back with turtle as he doesn't want to disappoint his children's.This is the mood of the entire movie, Its about a man caught between a loving family and a deadly game and he never gives up in both the roles.Even though i couldn't avoid the memories of some films (MillionDollar Baby, Rocky) i throughly enjoyed the movie as it kept me puzzled till the end of the movie (The climax fight is amazing).The movie seems to move slow (Turtle) but wins (Title).",Null,0,0,21 September 2005
The Island," The Island - Will Survive
","The Island directed by Michael Bay is a spine chilling action movie with enough stuff to keep you glued to your seat till the credits roll on the screen. What happens when your Insurance policy is sitting in your living room in front of you ? Well don't get puzzled ! The Island is the answer to it. Lincoln 6 Echo (Ewan) and Jordan 2 Delta (Scarlett) and many others are the products (Clones) who can come handy when their sponsors are in need (Human Parts). Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi has played their role beautifully.The Set director and the Background scorer has done a neat work, the sets are simple but stylish. The Island has every ingredient that an action movie should have to survive at the box office. For Michael (director) its yet another feather in his hat.",7,0,0,26 September 2005
