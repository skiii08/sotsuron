The Expendables 2," A Waste of time, Boring GUN action and NO story!
","I watched Expendables-2 today at V3S Mall(Fun Cinemas), Lakshmi Nagar, New Delhi. This time Fun Cinema sucked! There was no full screen and even it was out of focus and blurred. I felt I am watching a pirated movie!Now come to the movie. The movie has some good but boring GUN action, but don't know why I didn't like the movie much. Story was very flat (in fact no story). Arnold, Bruce, Jet Li and Chuck have a very less screen appearance. Sly and Jason are the main leads. Even the 'villain' Van Damme has also a weak part which could have been much much better, because there was a lot scope to his character. The biggest problem with the movie is a very weak story and a very less duration as compared to the characters in the film. I was very much positive about the role of Arnold but he got very less time on the screen. He must be given chance to show some muscular action, although he is aged now but with Arnold, expectations rise automatically. Sly should have opted Rajnikant instead of Chuck Norris :p All in all, Expendebles-2 is a weak film even it has hell amount of the action heroes. With said that, I really liked 'The A Team' in this genre. I watched The A Team 2 years ago. The A Team is like Expendables but the treatment of The A Team was far far superior. It had some story, twists and some very nice action. I would still recommend you watch 'The A Team'. It is far better than Expendables-2. (The opening scene was stolen from The A-Team, but they couldn't make it better).I wasted my Rs 600 on this garbage!My rating for Expendables-2 is 1/5.",1,33,54,25 August 2012
