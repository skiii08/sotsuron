Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Farce Awakens
","Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a movie I'm apprehensive to review; perhaps more than any other film ever. I only review movies if I feel I have something to interesting and unique to say. What unique viewpoint to do I have to give to the Star Wars prequels? - possibly the three most heavily critiqued films ever. I decided to watch all three prequels again (and hopefully for the last time) in order to get a fresh perspective on them. I believe I may have some unique points of view to offer; plus I am among the populace who is addicted to discussing every aspect of George Lucas' pop culture behemoth.Don't be too surprised when I tell you I hate the prequels - big shocker, right? However, The Phantom Menace is the prequel I dislike the least. The major aspect I find The Phantom Menace does have going for it over the other two prequels are the aesthetics. It comes the closest to resembling the original trilogy, if still incredibly far off. The Phantom Menace was shot on film and does feature on location filming and even some practical effects here and there, so the whole thing doesn't come off looking like a video game as Episodes II and III did. There is a lot of eye candy to behold, such as the locations such as the Palace of Caserta in Italy (why do you want to film everything on a green screen when beautiful places like this exist in the world?), while the costume design - not something I would normally comment on - is very pleasing to the eyes. The only two scenes in The Phantom Menace which has a little bit of that excitement that I get watching the original trilogy are the pod race and final lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul; an impressive display of acrobatics and is it's not choreographed within an inch of its life like the duels in Episodes II and III. But even these few aspects of the film I do enjoy are ultimately superficial as there is no internal conflict nor am I emotionally invested.What surprised me watching The Phantom Menace for the first time in a decade was just how incredibly frustrated I got. I've seen and read more reviews of this film over the years, analysing it to death and mocking every aspect of it. Watching the film again I expected to have reactions of 'yeah it sucks, what else is new', but sitting down and watching the entire thing my brain became so numb from the never-ending monotone exposition. I'm not even that keen on the John Williams score; it's not bad by any means - far from it - but it feels too dark and moody for a Star Wars movie. As fine a piece of music as Duel of the Fates is, those booming choirs feel out of place for Star Wars. In regards to the most hated fictional character of all time, I don't think Jar Jar is the absolute worst thing ever, I can at least tolerate him (if there's any character in the prequel trilogy that bothers me for how ridiculous they are: its General Grievous). Plus at least he's responsible for the only line from this film I like; 'The ability to talk does not you intelligent'.All three prequels lack the space western elements of the original trilogy, and I recall a comment that George Lucas intended The Phantom Menace to play out like a costume drama. Perhaps it's own such a direction could have worked if you know, the execution wasn't total pants. I can see what Lucas was perhaps going for in the story in trying to portray the fall of a democracy; the idea of radicals using political unrest as a means of coming to power - such as the Nazis using the turmoil caused by the great depression to amass power. Perhaps the empire isn't such a bad thing, it appears under their command the universe became a more interesting place.As someone who is interested in the relationship people have with popular culture, I find the most interesting aspect of The Phantom Menace is nothing in the film itself but rather its place in history. Think about it, the most anticipated movie of all time and it was a colossal letdown, and this occurring during the early days of the internet. What would the world of geekdom be like if The Phantom Menace actually lived up to expectations? Would an entire generation be less cynical? Would internet culture be the same as it is today, possibly for the better?",3,1,5,13 March 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Return of the Great Adventure!
","Indiana Jones is my second favourite movie character of all time. My number one favourite is Han Solo. Yes, the same actor played my first and second favourite movie characters. I don't care how many mediocre movies Harrison Ford may appear in during his later career, that's like eternal levels of respect and a miracle that this is even the case.The character of Indiana Jones is the ultimate escapist fantasy. A tough hero who goes on adventures around the world when he feels like it to obtain relics, escapes life and death situations, thwarts the bad guys and gets the girl in the end. Even his action moves are so indentified with his character (e.g., climbing underneath the back of a moving vehicle then holding onto it with his whip).Yet Indy is still human like the rest of us because of his overzealous confidence, thinking he's several steps ahead of the bad guys when he is not, his ability to make mistakes and his irrational fear of snakes. If there's a scene which I feel sums up the character of Indiana Jones, it's when he pulls out a gun on the sword-wielding Arab, a moment which wasn't even supposed to be the film (likewise that clothes hanger gag is also truly the product of genius minds). Making the character an unassuming nerdy professor is the other stroke of genius and making him a Clark Kent like figure; It's the biggest contrast of personalities, yet entirely believable. Just look at any Han vs. Indy debate for people pulling every facet of this character's personality apart but you can't blame them. Would Harrison Ford have had the career he had if it wasn't for Raiders? Or would he have faded away like his co-stars in a galaxy far far away?Does Raiders of the Lost Ark have the best character introduction of all time? The opening of the film tells you everything you need to know about the character of Indiana Jones, as well as having the hairs stand up on your back - Just that boulder alone permeates our culture. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those movies which everyone has seen, even those who haven't seen it. So many frames in the film are ingrained into the subconscious of film buffs and the general public alike. I feel what makes a film moment iconic is when you're pondering to yourself as you watch it of ways it could be parodied of spoofed; there's no shortage of that in Raiders.Nazis are the ultimate cinematic bad guys and this was even more poignant in 1981 than today when survivors of the Second World War were still alive. Even Ronald Lacy as Thot is no less scary with his baby face. The movie captures and emphasises the fear of Nazis and their quest for world domination; 'The army which carries the ark before it...is invincible'. Yet the film's climax seems to state that within the Indiana Jones universe, the Judeo Christian God exists or at the very least some higher power.There are shots in Cairo in Raiders which feel very Lawrence of Arabia and I'm not talking about the grand landscape shots. Likewise, in Lawrence of Arabia, there are moments which I could swear could have been a shot from Raiders of the Lost Ark. As for the music, I can remember listening to John Williams' The Raider's March when I was younger simply to lift my mood and inspire me. From the beauty of Marion's theme, the excitement of the desert chase music to the otherworldly Ark theme, how can one argue John Williams isn't the greatest film composer of all time? With all the Indiana Jones movies, I will watch the entire end credits just to listen to the score.The genius behind Raiders of the Lost Ark is the same stroke of genius which made Star Wars so great; I believe it's all to do with simplicity. They took such a simple B-movie level concept and glorified and made it larger than life. Spielberg and Lucas did it first and better than anyone has since and that's why these movies have such a widespread appeal and endure the way they do.",10,1,2,18 May 2015
Rocky V," Back To Where It All Began
","Few motion pictures seem to inspire as much intense dislike as Rocky V, even to the point of Sylvester Stallone himself giving the film a score of 'O' on a British talk show - yes, 0/10. Come on man, can you really say Rocky V has absolutely no merit what so ever? Even the sitcom The Vicar of Dibley bashes Rocky V in its pilot episode; 'Four's not bad is it? There were four gospels, four horsemen of the Apocalypse, four Rocky movies until they made Rocky V, very bad movie'. As a huge fan of the Rocky movies I'll just come out and say it, I love Rocky V. Oh yeah, deal with it! Part V was designed the return the series back to its roots, not only by bringing Rocky back to his humble beginning on the streets of Philadelphia but also by being directed by John G. Avildsen, the director the first Rocky. In my eyes, the film succeeds.Continuing the series tradition of recapping the fight from the previous film, Rocky V presents a recap of the Rocky- Drago fight scored with the traditional Rocky music by Bill Conti rather than the Vince DiCola score from Rocky IV, which is a nice touch. The opening title with the faces of Rocky and Drago in the lettering is also my favourite opening title in the series.The one big grip I do have with Rocky V is how it messes up the Rocky continuity. Just to give a brief recap of Rocky continuity from Rocky III onwards: it isn't made clear the date of which Rocky III ends, but we are told the date of Mickey's death as taking place in 1981 so we can assume Rocky's second fight with Clubber Lang took place in 1981/82. Rocky IV picks up where III left off, but no dates are mentioned in the movie nor is it made clear on the passing of time. It seems most likely the events of Rocky IV take place somewhere from 1982 to 1985, the year in which the movie was released. Rocky V picks up where Rocky IV left off, and once Rocky returns to America from Russia and gets off the plane, he is greeted by his teenage son; however, at the end of Rocky IV he was still a child. There should have been a passing of time and then introduce the teenage son. But on top of this, considering the early 90's aesthetic of Rocky V, due in part of its soundtrack, it seems like Rocky really did travel through time when flying that plane from the 80's world of Rocky IV. Perhaps some crazy fan theory explanation could solve the mystery such as Rocky staying in Russia for several years after his fight with Drago. While this plot hole does bother me a bit, does it really interfere with my enjoyment of the overall movie? No, not really.Once Rocky travels through time and is back in America, the family go home to a different mansion than that seen in Rocky III and IV, but I can accept perhaps they owned more than one. Regardless, due to an issue involving taxes, the Balboa family lose their fortune and are forced to return to return to Paulie's old place in Philadelphia. What was the tax issue? To quote IMDB's FAQ section for Rocky V:When Rocky was in Russia during Rocky IV, Paulie gave the power of attorney to Rocky's accountant, because the accountant told Paulie he needed to authorize a tax extension. Given free access to Rocky's accounts, the accountant used Rocky's savings to finance a real estate investment, planning on having the money back in the account by the time Rocky returned from Russia. However, the real estate deal went bad and the money was never returned. Additionally, Rocky discovers that he has debt payments, mortgage payments ($400,000) and that the accountant hasn't filed any of Rocky's tax returns for over 6 years.Ok, I'm not an expert on taxes, but the movie makes it sound convincing, so I'll buy it.Rocky's return to his old stomping ground gives the film a welcome nostalgia factor, from Rocky wearing his clothes from the first movie to Adrian being dowdy once again and working in the pet shop; to the return of locations from the first movie such as the Atomic Hoagie Shop. At one point in the film, they even repeat the very first shot of the original Rocky. Also, the streets of Philly appear to be more graffiti and trash-laden than they had been in 1975/76. Rocky V also features Burgess Meredith's final appearance as Mickey (even if he does look older than his last appearance in Rocky III), in a newly filmed flashback scene in which he gives one of the most powerful monologues in the series. This is ranks as one of my favourite scenes of the entire franchise, and I fail to see how anyone could deny its emotional impact.Due to Rocky's newly discovered brain damage, he can't return to the boxing ring and instead trains a new upcoming boxer Tommy Gunn (portrayed by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison); a predecessor to the plot of 2015's Creed. Tommy Gunn is nowhere near as iconic or memorable as Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago, but I still enjoy his character and find him more interesting than Mason 'The Line' Dixon in Rocky Balboa. He's an enthusiastic go-getter who eventually turns on his mentor and becomes seduced by the dark side of the boxing business. So yeah, it's a better version of Star Wars Episode III with Rocky as Obi-Wan, Tommy as Anakin and the boxing promoter George Washington Duke as Palatine. George Washington Duke is the main villain of the movie; a Don King-like boxing promoter. I love this guy; he's such a stereotypical loud-mouthed salesman, continuing the tradition of over the top Rocky Villains.However, the real heart of Rocky V lies with its father-son story with its themes of neglect and abandonment between Rocky and his son Robert, played by Stallone's real-life son, Sage Stallone; making the interactions between them feel more real and genuine. Not to mention the character of Robert has a frightening predicament of going from a sheltered life to living in a tough neighbourhood. It's weird to think that both Sage Stallone and Tommy Morrison are now both dead; two young stars from a movie which is only 26 years old. Stallone already hates Rocky V as it is, but having the movie star his deceased son I'd imagine makes the movie even more unwatchable for him. In regards to the subplot involving Robert and the school bullies, I actually find this aspect of the story to be interesting itself. I feel it showcases how in order to make peace with the bullies he had to fight them back and win the battle, and that Adrian's suggestion that she who would rather he solve his problems verbally would be a futile gesture. After he fights the bullies he then immediately makes peace with one of them and they become friends. Could this be a war parable, or am I just over-analysing?Despite V being the black sheep of the franchise, Rocky V still ends on a fight, not in the ring but on the street. Having Rocky take part in a barbaric street fight makes for great entertainment, due in part to the fun of seeing Rocky engage in a fight in which there are no rules. I also love all the over the top crowd reactions ('Come on dad, he took my room!', 'You're losing everything!'). The film's final pay off is immensely satisfying in which Rocky punches George Washington Duke right into the air and onto a car; what comeuppance!Rocky V reintroduces Bill Conti's music after being absent from Rocky IV. However, the soundtrack of Rocky V is mainly comprised of hip-hop and RnB. I'm not a fan of hip-hop, but I do like the songs included in the film. With Go For It I get the impression they were trying to create a new Eye of the Tiger; a song which is named after a phrase which is repeated throughout the film which is central to the plot. It could never be as iconic as Eye of the Tiger, but it still gets me jamming. I also love the new version of Take You Back which gives the song an early 90's spin. All the films in the series reflect the periods in which they were made, and for Rocky V it's the early 90's.I've heard reviewers complain Rocky V is a depressing ending to the series. It becomes clear at the end of the film that Rocky learns he doesn't need wealth to be happy providing he's still got his family and his health; and eventually he chooses his family over his career, pride, and ego. This is a theme which ties in with the end credits song The Measure of a Man sung by Elton John:
'You've come full circle, now you're home, without the gold, without the chrome. And this is where you've always been, you had to lose so you could win. And rise above your troubles while you can.'I did not find Rocky V in any way to undermine to optimistic nature of the series. Initially, it was scripted for Rocky to die at the end, and there is even a deleted scene which shows the character of Marie from the first movie continued to hang out with the wrong crowd. These elements would make an interesting alternative version, but for my Rocky canon, I prefer the direction they took. Plus the reintroduction of Marie in Rocky Balboa was a better path for the character, more in tune with the series' optimistic nature.The end credits of Rocky V give a retrospective of the entire series which couldn't be more perfect, plus I love the song The Measure of a Man. I don't often talk about how great the end credits of a film are, yet with all the Rocky sequels I watch the credits in their entirety. Rocky V is the black sheep of the series in terms of plot structure. We already have four movies which end with Rocky fighting an opponent in the ring, it would have been tiresome to do that a fifth time. Instead, Stallone wrote a sequel which took a chance. So yes, I love Rocky V. Got a problem with that, then my ring's outside!",10,4,4,24 March 2018
12 Angry Men," ...and Justice for All
","I don't think I can bestow a higher statement of praise on a film than to call it a life-changing experience. 12 Angry Men influenced me not to believe everything I hear, instead to question things and ultimately turning me into a more skeptical person; there is more to life than meets the eye (or ear). It's one of few films which helped shape who I am as a person. When watching it I constantly visualise the details in my head of the events and locations of the murder case described in the film. At the beginning of the film, all the jurors bar one believe the boy in question is guilty of murdering his father. By the end of the film, they all change their vote to not guilty. How is this possible? Why just the most incredible 90-minute exhibition of human psychology and argumentation. I enjoy never knowing what really happened; did the kid commit murder or not? It's up for the viewer to decide.12 Angry Men is a movie that is hard to write a review for; I wouldn't be surprised if I come back to add more since I find myself watching 12 Angry Men at least once a year. With layer upon layer upon layer, this is a movie I could talk about hours, and always finding new aspects to discuss on each viewing - Ah the joy of an engrossing, wordy, civil debate. As the exposition reveals more details of the case I am left saying in the words of Milhouse Van Houten, 'Tell me more!' 12 Angry Men is like Pringles, once you pop you just can't stop, stop watching that is.Every time I watch 12 Angry Men I find myself focusing on a different character. I'd have to watch the 12 times in order to fully explore every character, all representative of personalities we're likely to encounter in real life'; I'm sure I've encountered each one at some point in my life. This is a movie that needed a cast comprised of character actors (aside from Henry Fonda) in order to create such personalities. The characters are believable without being two-dimensional stereotypes. Not all of them leave prejudice at the door; it's more obvious with some than others. Not all of them really take much interest in the case or have much pride being part of a jury and even treating it as a bit of a joke at times; even the judge at the beginning doesn't to be very enthusiastic about the case at hand. They even display different levels of confidence and surety in their opinions - when every juror announces they have changed their mind you can see on their faces how difficult that admission is.12 Angry Men also provides possibly the best cinematic insight into group conflict and argumentation. Like with a jury or a classroom full of people, this large variety of personalities are unlikely to converge elsewhere in a small space for a period of time in which they have to communicate with each other, such as what John Hughes would explore with his teen detention drama in 1985 with The Breakfast Club. You really get a sense of who likes who and who doesn't as the heat beats down in that claustrophobic space. Director Sidney Lumet made the cast spend time with each other before filming and it certainly helped. I don't feel like I'm watching actors, I feel like I'm watching a group of everyday people in a jury. As not all US states at the time opened their doors to having women present within juires; the film is not 12 Angry Men and Women. I imagine the feminine point of few would have influenced the examination of the proceedings; just think of Grace Kelly's female instincts from Rear Window.The cast:Juror #1 (Martin Balsam):The Jury Foreman. He doesn't express any opinion or reasons for changing his vote, taking a neutral stance and moderates the proceedings.Juror #2 (John Fiedler):Nerdy and socially awkward; reminds me of Rick Moranis. I find it interesting that he is placed sitting beside Lee J. Cobb's juror #3 as the two are polar opposites. He finds it difficult to articulate an opinion at first but grows confidence and later stands up to the other jurors.Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb):Lee J. Cobb is my favourite of the cast, in my view being the most interesting complex character with the biggest ark as the opinionated and brash antagonist, Juror #3; ultimately stealing the show. He seems fair and rational at first until we gradually discover he wants to boy on trial found guilty for personal reasons. He is by far the most confrontational juror as he contests every single rebuttal thrown his way and never concedes a good point. This is a strategy that even leads him to shoot himself in the foot when he destroys his own argument by frantically stating 'he was an old man, half the time he was confused, how could be positive about anything?' Juror #3's breakdown at the end is a highlight in a film full of awe-inspiring performances. His angry outburst to Fonda that he'll kill him followed by Fonda's response of 'You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?', is surely one of the greatest zingers in cinema history.Juror #4 (E. G. Marshall):A cold-hearted individual which is reflected by his wearing of a jacket throughout the whole 90 minutes despite the heat. He is a metaphorical representation of cold, hard facts. He is arguably the most competent and restrained debater and also a bit of a 'know it all' which makes it all the more interesting and satisfying when he changes his vote. Likewise, the movies and stars mentioned during his cross-examination by Juror #8 are not real (yes I looked them up).Juror #5 (Jack Klugman):Comes from a slum background although his appearance doesn't suggest this. He votes guilty on two occasions despite the boy on trail coming from his same background. His decision to change his vote could have been influenced by the accusation from Juror #3 (both still being a member of the guilty party at this point) that he had changed his vote due to sharing the same background the boy on trial, when in fact he hadn't changed his vote.Juror #6 (Edward Binns):The most normal juror, doesn't stand out - a very regular John Doe. He even states he's not a 'supposing man' and that his boss does all the supposing. He doesn't have anything to add when asked for his opinion, just repeating points that have already been made in an unsure manner.Juror #7 (Jack Warden):Clearly doesn't want to be there and doesn't care about the case and even bullies and tries to intimidate other jurors. He has no respect for the grounds with his gum-chewing and litter throwing and although he never outright says he wants to leave and go to the ball game which he has tickets for, but it's painfully obvious from the beginning.Juror #8/ Davis (Henry Fonda):The film's protagonist and the outsider of the jury. A soft-spoken and rarely confrontational man who is brave enough to stand up to the collective and going against popular opinion, even when the rest of them get frustrated with him. Fonda like in many of his movies is a beacon of truth and justice here, but he doesn't come off as unbelievable saintly - even with his wearing of a white suit. The scene in which he puts his knife in the table is a gasping moment if there ever was one.Juror #9/ McCardle (Joseph Sweeney):The most elderly member of the jury. Juror #1 states he should be respected because of that, and I believe this is deserved because of his knowledge and his confidence in Juror #8.Juror #10 (Ed Begley):The most obviously bigoted member of the jury and thus ultimately doesn't prove to be a huge help to the proceedings with talking out of turn, his prejudiced rants or his hypocrisy in defending the woman's statement despite her also being 'one of them' too. At one point he even suggests telling a funny story he heard rather than discussing the case and eventually gets expelled from the table when his bigotry is denied an audienceJuror #11 (George Voskovec):An Eastern European immigrant (possibly from behind the Iron Curtain) who takes more pride in the American justice system as well as democracy than any of the American members of the Jury, even defending it such as when Juror #10 demands that Juror #5 reveals his voting choice. Likewise, I love his statement to Juror #2 in response to what side he is on: 'I don't believe I have to be loyal to one side or the other, I'm simply asking questions'. Juror #11 is a watchmaker who regularly points out the time, ah, I see what you did there movie!Juror #12 (Robert Webber):A huckster in the advertising business which makes sense as he himself looks very manufactured. I get the impression he represents 1950's conformity with his appearance, looking like a character from a Rock Hudson/Doris Day comedy with his very 50's glasses and hair. He goes along with the crowd, even changing his vote more than once.Is Jury Duty really this incredible in the real world? At the end of 12 Angry Men I wonder if the jurors are aware that they've just experienced probably the most incredible 90 minutes of their lives.",10,0,1,24 March 2018
Hot Fuzz," Proper Action and Sh*t
","Hot Fuzz is my favourite comedy of the new millennium, as well as in my top 5 favourite films of said era. I already thought Shaun of the Dead itself was a perfect film, yet Hot Fuzz is even better.There are so many film and pop culture references, inside jokes and foreshadowing, ranging from the subtle to the more obvious. Just how long does it take to write a movie this layered? It's like Bad Boys meets The Vicar of Dibley meets The Wicker Man. British comedy has long been about quality over quantity, just look at the small episode count of British sitcoms, or films by Aardman Animations which employee a similar style of humour to Hot Fuzz; there is more comedy in this one film than several Hollywood comedies combined. The pacing and consistency of the jokes in Hot Fuzz is perfect, never is there more than 10 seconds that I'm not laughing. For me the best laugh was saved until the end, when the swan attacks the police officer in the car.Those moments when Danny (Nick Frost) asks Nicholas Angel about films he has seen, just how many times have I been in this situation in real life, when someone names films one by one (usually junk food films), and when you say you haven't seen one they keep going onto you about it. Angel himself manages to be a likable character despite his overt political correctness, but for me Timothy Dalton steals the show. He really is one of the last of his kind, as a Shakespearean trained actor who can play these types of debonair villains, here he just has the smuggest look on his face.It's easy for a film to mock bureaucracy, this seems to be one film which speaks in its favour, then again how many films can make the act of filling out paperwork look exciting. The film's use of fascism and the concept of 'The Greater Good' (the greater good!) as a theme surprisingly is highly thought provoking.Hot Fuzz satirizes action movies by being grounded in reality and with Danny's misconceptions between fantasy and reality, yet at the same time also celebrates them. Having an action movie with British police officers, set in a small English town and full of Hollywood action movie tropes, the concept works on so many levels, likely because there doesn't exist a tradition of cop movies in the UK. Plus having the bad guy's hideout being an outlet for an actual British supermarket chain is another stroke of brilliance. There's just something refreshing and satisfying watching these Hollywood clichés spoofed in a British manner. Action movies have never been a favourite genre of mine, especially this brand of shaky cam, fast cut action, but the action scenes here are legitimately edge of your seat thrilling. The film's use of CGI blood is my only complaint, but when a film is this amazing I can look past this one flaw. Thank you Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg for improving the greater good of British cinema (the greater good!).",10,0,0,12 June 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Bored and Confused
","For my money Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End represents everything wrong in contemporary blockbuster cinema and anyone who paid money to go and see is contributing to the decline of western civilization; unfortunately that also includes me resulting in the single most boring, confusing and frustrating movie I ever had the misfortune of viewing and in a movie theatre no less! For beginners, the movie's opening scene which shows people including children being hanged should act as a metaphor for the next 168 minutes of terror.A $300 million dollar budget, and for what? Huge CGI battle sequences with characters I couldn't give a monkeys about fighting each other, well actually I take that back because I don't even know what they're fighting about. This movie is like the First World War, nobody knows what it's all about. I enjoyed the first installment of this franchise was disappointed with the sequel due to its incomprehensible plot but At World's End goes beyond that. I literally don't have a clue what is going on. Whose side anyone is on? Who's that guy? Why are they going to this place? What's that thing? Even reading the movie's plot on Wikipedia I can't get my read around it but then again they did start shooting the film before a script was completed.While I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance in the first two movies here he is, no apologies, annoying; very, very annoying. When we are first introduced to Jack Sparrow in this film it isn't just one Jack Sparrow, there are dozens of Jack Sparrows and they won't shut up. Too much a good thing, way too much! One scene which particular aggravated me is when a bunch of characters are sitting around a table debating who knows what and it goes on for an eternity. It's like 12 Angry Men, except it's not and there's only one angry man, me, watching the dam thing. I tend to avoid using the word hate unless I really mean it but few other movies have enraged me as much as this 'movie'. I know every movie on the IMDB boards has a topic in which some proclaims it as the worst film they've ever seen but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End really is one of the absolute worst films I've ever seen.",1,2,2,12 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Luke Be a Jedi Tonight!
","It's not easy calling Return of the Jedi your favourite Star Wars film. Were as when someone says The Empire Strikes Back is their favourite they get cheers from the crowd. Call Return of the Jedi your favourite you get boos and hisses followed by a rigorous defense of your opinion. Well, it could be worse; those who call the prequels their favourite usually get stoned or hanged by a lynch mob.I find Return of the Jedi to be the film in the series which satisfies me the most in this swashbuckling space adventure. I like how it combines elements from both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back from Hope's light-hearted nature and the nostalgic return to Tatooine, to Empire's darker nature with Luke confronting Vader and the Emperor. But when I think Return of the Jedi I think redwood forests. The forest moon of Endor is such a splendour to look at, and once again proves that Planet Earth is the greatest movie set of all.Let's talk about everyone's favourite addition to the Star Wars universe, shall we? I am indeed speaking of the Ewoks. The dismissive statements towards these creatures that the empire was brought down by a bunch of teddy bears I find to be very close-minded. I completely agree with George Lucas that they showcase how it is possible for a primitive race to bring down a technologically advanced superpower such as the empire is inspired by the Viet Cong's offense against the Americans during the Vietnam War. I like this message as it's true that the most advanced technology isn't always the best means; sometimes less is more. I know many say the idea of Ewoks helping bring down the Empire was highly improbable. Well, my answer to that is remember Yoda's lesson in The Empire Strikes Back, 'Judge me by my size do you?'. The cute nature of the Ewoks (along with their whimsy yet epic theme music) provides a counterbalance to the darker scenes in Return of the Jedi. Yet the Ewok's themselves are not without their own darker side. At one point in the film, they have no remorse when they intend to burn out heroes alive and notice how they use the helmets of dead stormtroopers as musical instruments.Likewise, Return of the Jedi has too many puppets? I'm used to hearing people complain about movies which use too much CGI but a movie using too many practical effects - that's a new one. The creature department and their astounding levels of creativity employed for Return of the Jedi hit it out of the park with creations such as the odd-looking yet enamoring fish create that is Admiral Ackbar. It's just a shame people look at this cynically and say they were just trying to sell toys.Return of the Jedi does not disappoint in its reveal of Jabba the Hut. The space gangster whose name is mentioned in the previous two movies with no indication as to whether or not he was a human, an alien or something different altogether (at least in the original theatrical versions). In a masterwork of puppetry, Jabba is a wonderfully, horrendous creature design; an extreme, gluttonous version of Sydney Greenstreet. Return of the Jedi also contains the iconic bikini Leia. More than just a sex symbol (insert Tex Avery wolf here), it also gives way to the powerful image of Leia strangler Jabba, her enslaver with the very chains attached to her body.My favourite action scene in any movie ever is a toss between the final car chase in The Blues Brothers and the escape from Jabba in Return of the Jedi (with the later speeder bike chase not being far behind). Talk about a 'How are they going to get out of that?' moment; in which they do in a convincing, heart racing like crazy manner. I love how the escape is one big elaborate plan which all our heroes are in on, not to mention the introduction of Luke's green lightsaber in a shot that couldn't look more majestic. Also, I never understood people's love affair with Boba Fett, so his death didn't bother me. To the contrary I find his death to be interesting in how unconventional it is; this tough badass who doesn't go out with a bang, but rather dies in a humiliating fashion. I was more concerned with Lando being on the cusp of death!The second half of Return of the Jedi is one of the most intense, involving and grand cinematic experiences. Cutting between the assault on the imperial cruisers and the second death star, the assault on Endor and the powerful emotions when Luke is confronting Vader and the senile, scenery chewer that is Emperor Palpatine; it perplexes me that people can put down this movie so much. Having a second Death Star sounds like a lazy idea on paper but I fell they get away with it due to the immaculate execution. I love the incomplete appearance of Death Star II and the film's final battle involves ships navigating through the tunnels and into the center of the battle station makes for a dogfight even more exciting than that from A New Hope. Likewise, while it's near impossible to go into these movies for the first time fresh unless you've spent your whole life under a rock, but I didn't have previous knowledge that Luke and Leia are brother and sister; which is one surprise the original Star Wars trilogy had for me.Science fiction cinema had never seen a finer moment between the final confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor. The optimism of Luke Skywalker to find the good in someone as evil as Darth Vader and bring him away from the dark side is inspiring in this powerful arch of redemption as Vader returns to the light side just at the very end of his life; a life he sacrificed in order to save Luke's. The unmasking of Vader is enough to make grown men cry, and seeing the ghost of Anakin Skywalker played Sebastian Shaw (sorry Hayden Christensen) appear to next to the ghosts of Obi-wan and Yoda is awe inspiring. Revenge of the Sith, a Shakespearean tragedy? Pfft, please. This is proper storytelling tragedy. I couldn't ask for a better finale to a better trilogy. Ah, Return of the Jedi, I know people give you flak but to me, you're perfect the way you are - Ewoks and all.",10,0,0,4 May 2015
The Grapes of Wrath," California, Super Cool To The Homeless
","The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.Yokels, rednecks, hillbillies - everyone's favourite punching bag. The Grapes of Wrath doesn't look down America's uneducated, rural white folk nor presents them as a caricature but that still doesn't change the fact that none of the Joad clan are the sharpest tools in the shed nor don't understand how the outside world works. Just as we are introduced to the family the youngest daughter Rosasharn is pregnant and married when still a teen while the family is dirt poor and huge as it is.Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad may be the pinnacle of his acting career. His stone face alongside the laid-back manner in which he walked and talked is mesmerising yet Joad is not someone I would fancy being in the vicinity off. Fonda's performance has a sinister edge to it and a sense of barely restrained violence. His proclamation to the truck driver near the beginning of the film when telling him the reason he was in prison, a simple uttering of 'homicide' could come straight out of a horror movie. Jane Darwell on the other hand as Ma Joad is the other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre, tour-de-force performance as a character with one ultimate aim - keeping the fambly together.The amazing landscape shots, use of German expressionism and high contrast lighting give way for such unforgettable images from a car light driving along the horizon to silhouettes walking across a hill, thanks to cinematographer Gregg Toland. Take the scene at the campsite in which the characters discuss their present situation; it's so dreamlike with the odd, unnatural angles, it couldn't be more mesmerising. I also recommend watching the South Park episode Over Logging which parodies this scene (and the movie as a whole), right down to the black & white cinematography.Once the Joads arrive at the Farmworkers' Wheat Patch run by the Department of Agriculture it is a temporary relief to see something good happen to the family, after all, they have been through. When The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1940, the US Secretary of Agriculture was Henry A. Wallace, whom that same year was running for Vice President with Franklin D. Roosevelt; a message of support for FDR and the New Deal no doubt? At the government camp they are greeted by a seemingly genuine, honest man who looks like FDR and tells them they have washtubs with running water; a world away from the corporate run camps the Joads took residence earlier in the film - all sounds too good to be true? The government is the solution to the Joad's problems (temporally at least as they end up leaving at a later point), nor at any point in the film do we see any charitable organisations out to help the poor. It's fairly obvious that The Grapes of Wrath doesn't exactly lean to the right of politics; evil bankers running people off their land, corrupt police, capitalists treating people like dogs, total collapse of the free market, socialist camp run by the government is only decent place to be in which cops are not allowed to lines of dialogue such as 'people are going to win rich, people are going to die'. - A world of oppressor and the oppressed if there ever existed one. Regardless of one's politics, I still contend The Grapes of Wrath to be one of the most emotionally draining films in all of cinema.",10,4,4,7 October 2018
Rocky II," Rocky II: Electric Boogaloo
","Rocky II picks right off where the first movie ended and with the characters are already established, we can get right into the story. Stallone writes and directs this time, and who knows his own creation better than him?Rocky II has a much higher budget than the first film and thus doesn't have the guerrilla filmmaking tactics of the first so while it loses something in that regard it's still no less a beauty of a film. They can even afford to have a huge crowd of kids following him during the training montage and possibly the cheesiest moment in any Rocky movie. We now get two montages instead of one and the series obsession with them would grow from here. The final fight benefits the most from the higher budget. We actually get to see a large crowd of spectators instead of relying on stock footage and camera angels disguising the lack of extras; while the use of slow-motion captures the pain and barbaric nature of fighting in glorious detail. When Rocky and Apollo both fall to the ground at the end of the fight, the suspense is crazy! The final shot of Rocky's beat up face as he slurs in classic Stallone fashion is so barbaric; a perfect shot to end the movie on.In Rocky II we get to see what Rocky does now that he has lots of money for the first time in his life and you really get a sense of the character's new found happiness. However, he becomes blinded by this happiness and it goes to his head such as when he buys a house without even checking the upstairs. Rocky struggles with his new found fame and can't even film a simple commercial. Just like how the public turn their back on Rocky, the public turned their back on Stallone after his two follow up films to Rocky bombed; Paradise Alley and F.I.S.T. Like how Stallone had to do a sequel to Rocky in order to get by, Rocky has to fight Apollo again to get by and prove that he is not a fluke or a one hit wonder. Apollo's trainer Duke also has a bigger role here and would continue to be more prevalent in Rocky III and IV; I love this guy and his intense words of inspiration.Rocky II is easily the funniest movie in the series, from his poor driving skills to his mispronunciation of words when trying to film a commercial ('Smeel mainly') but my favourite moment is when he tries to a catch a chicken as part of his training ('I feel like a Kentucky Fired Idiot'). I also find it funny the scene in which Apollo is being consumed by hate mail telling him to kill himself; it's a good thing for him the web doesn't yet exist. In terms of more twisted humour, Rocky takes Adrian to the zoo and even proposes to her there, because you know, retards like the zoo.Rocky II was the first film in the series to use synthesizers in its score and the music feels very late 70's and at times disco inspired (listen to the vocal version of All of My Life, it's beautiful). Bill Conti's 'Redemption' is by far the best piece of original music in the movie; it makes me want to climb a mountain.
Just a side note: In regards to the Rocky DVDs, only the first movie gets the special edition treatment and the rest are just bare bones releases. I know the first is considered the best but that doesn't mean there's no merit to the sequels that they're just tossed aside on the home video releases.Rocky II offers everything I could ask for in a sequel, a movie which stays true to the original but offers new elements along the way. It advances the story and adds an extra layer of depth to already complex characters. In 1979 the New Hollywood movement was coming to an end and the age of the blockbuster had begun. In 1976 Rocky lost the final fight but keeping with the newfound optimism in Hollywood movies, in 1979 Rocky wins the fight (although timeline wise its late 1976).",10,1,1,12 August 2016
The Color of Money," The Rules of the Game
","I've never been more aroused by a film's editing and cinematography than that featured in The Color of Money, a film which I ultimately enjoyed more than it's predecessor The Hustler. It just so happens I first watched The Color of Money during my time as a film student and attempted to replicate many of the film's shots and edits for a music video (and an intentionally 80's music video at that) as I studied the cuts present in the film frame by frame. Needless to say, I was not entirely successful in my endeavour.The Color of Money has the fast pace and rhythm of MTV music videos but still with a sense of old-school class and sophistication; right from the opening credits, I can tell this would be a movie dripping in atmosphere. A movie so snappy, fast-paced and full of quick edits, many of which come unexpectedly along with many unconventional camera movements yet it never feels disorientating or distracting as the scenes glide with such fluidity and ease. The cinematography on display here isn't that of a David Lean production, no this is a movie which largely takes place in bars and pool halls yet it still has a sense of majesty and scope even if the shot in question is a close up of a drinking glass. Really the only edit I can fault is the very cheesy freeze frame of Paul Newman jumping out of a swimming pool. On the other hand, nobody uses licensed soundtracks better than Martin Scorsese. I get the impression scenes in the film were shot with the music in mind and not as an afterthought. With the opening scene, it feels like Phil Collins' One More Night was specifically composed to fit the mood and tone of the scene.The Color of Money however is not style over substance. I love the intriguing character triangle of a trio of hustlers as well as the harmony of two generations coming together. Tom Cruise is an actor I only like in certain parts but in roles such as Vincent, a cocky, male fantasy indulging character who embodies the entrepreneurial and capitalistic spirit of the 1980's (like his character in Risky Business), I simply revel in - as Eddie puts it 'a natural character'. Just as impressive are pool shots done by Cruise himself (he performed all but one of his own trick shots); makes me energised to play some pool myself.",10,2,3,24 October 2017
Rocky IV," 80's: The Movie
","Rocky IV is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. If there was ever a movie I can turn to for just 90 minutes of pure, immense, adrenaline filled, inspirational entertainment, it's Rocky IV. The runtime is the shortest of the series, but those 90 minutes are perfect. The poster for Rocky IV is displayed proudly in my bedroom, and every now and then I look at it in all its majesty with Rocky sticking his glove up in the air while draped in the stars and stripes. I feel the Rocky movies had the ideal lifespan for a movie franchise; start off serious, goof out for some fun, but then end again on a serious note.There's no question about it, Rocky IV is the most 80's movie ever. Case in point:
<ul><li>Synthesized rock soundtrack.</li></ul>-Cold war propaganda.
-Conservative, Reagan era values.
-MTV music video style montages.
-Larger than life villain.
-It's a sequel of a long-running franchise.
-There's a robot.
-Rocky drives a sports car.
-Display of decadence.
-Brigitte Nielsen, star of other very 80's movies Red Sonja and Cobra.
-Action movie revenge plot.
-Full of cheesy/corny quotable lines ('If he dies, he dies', 'Whatever he hits, he destroys').Stallone's inspiration for Rocky IV came from the two fights between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling in 1936 and 1938 respectively; two fights which embodied the political and social conflict of the time - an African American taking on a supposed representation of Aryan superiority. Thus in Rocky IV we get Ivan Drago, the terrifying Aryan superman Rocky must challenge to avenge the death of his friend (could that sound more 80's?). Ivan Drago is a terminator; the strongest opponent humanly possible; however is Drago an interesting villain? I say yes; one of my favourite screen villains of all time as a matter of fact. In a memorable Siskel & Ebert moment, Roger Ebert described Drago as a 'moderately interesting villain' but complained 'how come he never has a single scene alone with his wife' and 'why does she have nine times more dialogue than he has?'. Drago doesn't speak for himself as there is no individualism in communism. I feel Dolph Lundgren gives a great physical performance, playing a character who is the opposite of Clubber Lang in that he speaks few words; succeeding in being an intimidating monster with his physical presence alone. I also love Drago's reaction to Apollo's entrance at the exhibition fight; that of a Soviet being welcomed to America.Ivan Drago is a product of a state that sponsors his training as exemplified in the movie's two training montages. Drago's music theme is cold, intimidating and mechanical, just like his training. He is given steroids by his trainers and at a press conference an American reporter says 'There have been rumors of blood doping and widespread distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union'; feels like an eerie foreshadowing to the state-operated Russian doping scandal of 2016. Following the boycotts at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, Rocky IV couldn't have come at a better time when sports and politics were going hand in hand. Drago's fit of rage near the end of the fight in which he proclaims 'I fight to win. For me! For me!', is clearly a jab at communism as he wants to work for himself and not for the glory of the country. Likewise, when he lifts up and throws the Russian official who criticises him, it's a classic Frankenstein moment; the monster turning on its creator.Apollo Creed's entrance, on the other hand, is one of the most capitalistic things ever put on film, with James Brown singing Living In America among Belly Dancers and Apollo Creed dressed in stars and stripes; and to top it all off, it's in Las Vegas. A stark contrast to the Russians who open the Rocky-Drago fight later in the movie to their national anthem (yet another awe-inspiring musical highlight in the film). Did Apollo's ego untimely kill him? Apollo's patriotic egotism clouded his better judgment and no idea just how strong Drago would be. The sheer power of Drago's punches during the fight with Creed (if you could even call it that) is exemplified by the sound effects. Also, why does Drago receives no punishment for throwing the referee aside, but if I was going to point out every little thing in this movie which makes no sense I'd be here all day. There's such brutality to Creed's death; such slow motion brutality. I'll never forget my mum's reaction the first time I watched Rocky IV, a gasping 'oh my God!'.When I was studying for my GCSE examinations, the Rocky IV soundtrack was one of my primary sources of music listening. Whenever I have a stressful day of work I listen to the Rocky IV soundtrack when I need that extra bit of adrenaline to make me go on. Feeling down? Rocky IV soundtrack! Need inspiration? Rocky IV soundtrack! Having a workout? Rocky IV soundtrack! 20% of the Rocky IV or 23 minutes is comprised montages with songs which can make anything look epic in one of the epitomes of the 1980's soundtrack; everything you would expect from a score which won the Razzi for worst music score. The score by Vince diCola has been officially released but copies are not easy to come by. The actual Rocky IV soundtrack features different versions of War and Training Montage than those which appear in the film, although these variants are good in their own right.If there is one word associated with Rocky IV, its montage. I can watch these montages over and over again and still be enthralled by them. The first training montage is heavy on its symbolism of nature vs. machine and showcases the beauty of the Russian wilderness. Ok, it's actually Wyoming but I can buy into it being a vast frozen expanse of the Soviet Union. But it's training montage number 2 which has to be my favourite training montage in film history. This is partly due to John Cafferty's Hearts on Fire - a motivating, pumping song if there ever was one. That synth, god I love it! In the spirit of everything in Rocky IV being larger than life, instead of running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the montage ends with Rocky climbing a mountain.The editing of Rocky IV also contributes to the film's bombastic nature. The transitional shots of magazine covers and newspaper articles make the film play out like more of a comic book than it already is. Likewise, shots such as that of Rocky's Russian chaperone looking into binoculars gets repeated three times within a few seconds but zoomed in further each time and edited to the rhythm of the score; it's just so cool. On the other hand, I even recall a review I heard for Star Wars: The Forces Awakens refer the final shot of that movie as a Rocky IV shot, in reference to the aerial shot of Rocky on top of the mountain. Is Rocky IV a more influential than the history books say?Rocky IV is incredibly distant from the first movie but this is appropriate as Rocky is out of his element and in a foreign land. This is the only film in the series not to take place in Philadelphia unless you include the scene in the Balboa mansion although it's never made clear where the mansion is located. The No Easy Way Out montage provides you with clips from the first movie, so it the film itself allows you to bask in the stark contrast between the movies; a man who used to be a not very intelligent nobody and made money from prizefighting and working for a loan shark is now at the center of international politics.Even the sheer predictably of Rocky IV is wonderful, such as when Adrian shows up in Russia to support Rocky; it's all cliché but in the best sense of the word. The build-up to the final fight and the atmosphere is so immense; there could never be a Rocky film more epic than this. By this point, I'm actually scared for Rocky and fearful for his life, and Paulie's emotional outpour before the fight, it gets me every time. I don't care what anyone says, this is the greatest fight in film history. Rules don't apply and Rocky somehow lasts the 15 rounds and even wins over the crowd ('Suddenly Moscow is pro-Rocky!'). This isn't just Rocky against another opponent, this is Rocky against a superhuman, a hostile crowd, a Mikhail Gorbachev lookalike and an entire world superpower. Keep your superhero movies with their city-destroying battles; this is what I call a duel! Rocky's final speech is naive in the most wonderful way. The words of the speech are so juvenile, yet when I hear Stallone utter them in the movie; it brings a tear to my eye. Did Rocky IV really help end the cold war? Who knows? Oh, and the end credits provide us with yet another awesome montage!Rocky IV embodies the essence of capitalism the American Dream; if you work hard, success is attainable. I know many would just look at the movie and scoff at it as a simplified look at the Cold War with an 'us and them' mentality. But as a piece of propaganda does it work? Oh, you bet it does. Rocky IV, I salute you to your over the top, cheesy 80's perfection.Rocky IV > Citizen Kane",10,10,12,24 March 2018
Gone with the Wind," The Great American Movie
","So it's about time I finally got around to reviewing the big cheese itself, the towering achievement of American cinema, those four glorious syllables - Gone With The Wind.Gone With the Wind testament to how much filmmaking had changed in just 10 years from the beginning to the talkie period. From the astounding cinematic shots such as the long take of the bodies of fallen soldiers lying in the streets of Atlanta to those red Technicolor skies which I could stare at all day and huge matte paintings which are hard to distinguish from real sets - it's a world to get lost in (I can even ignore the very clear continuity error at the beginning of the film when it goes from dusk back to early evening to dusk again). Even those opening titles themselves are breathtaking, let alone for a time when opening titles where a basic on-screen title card.Gone With the Wind is a film with a fascinating history as it's backdrop. The pink elephant in the room however for many modern viewers is the troublesome historical image of the American South both pre and post-antebellum, whether just or unjust. The emphasis on the Wilkes family marrying their cousins doesn't help things but the real but the real point of contention is the dreaded 'R' word, racism. To dismiss Gone With the Wind as a racist film is such a reductive argument, especially when certain commentators liken it to The Birth of a Nation, a film which shows black members of the House of Representatives eating fried chicken. To actually watch Gone With the Wind and study it closely, the way the film examines the racial issues is more 3 dimensional than popular critique contends.Gone With the Wind is told from the point of view of slave owners who don't see anything wrong with owning slaves (nor is it ever made clear if the plantation owners start paying their former slaves following the end of the war). The slave owners are a product of their time which the movie doesn't pass judgment on. Only one line of dialogue in the film deals with the question of morality when it comes to slavery in which Ashley responds to Scarlett's use of prisoners for labour which implies Ashley sees nothing wrong with slavery providing the slaves are treated well;
'Scarlett, I will not make money out of the enforced labour and misery of others'
'You won't so particular about owning slaves'
'That was different; we didn't treat them that way'I find by far the most interesting aspect the portrayal of race in Gone With The Wind is the stark contrast between the black carpetbaggers (northerners who came to the south following the war who were perceived to be exploiting the local populace) and the recently freed slaves who are still childlike, dim-witted and happy to help out their masters of whom they are dependent on. The first black carpetbagger seen in the film features a sharply dressed, liberated northern black man traveling with a white accomplish but more significantly, in a scene not long after this Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) sneers at a pair of African-American carpetbaggers who are wearing fancy suits, smoking cigars and laughing. Mammy, who just had to beg for money along with Scarlett, sneers at this black men having the time of their lives. While the phrase is not used in the movie, these individuals would be referred to in many quarters as 'Uncle Toms', perceived sellouts to their black brethren. The appearance of independent, well to do black men from the North goes against the narrative of Gone With The Wind being a racist film. I'm not qualified to comment on the historical accuracy of Gone With the Wind or how well it portrayed the time and place it depicts but there's too much nuance within the film's depiction to simply shout 'wasis!' rather than having a more productive conversation or what the film did or did not do right. To quote the late, great Roger Ebert, 'A politically correct 'GWTW' would not be worth making, and might largely be a lie.'The film's opening prologue and the scenic shots of Tara could be seen as Confederate propaganda with its Utopian presentation of a world alongside the opening prologue which reads;
'There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. Here in this pretty world, Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind.'Yet if there's any authorial or filmmaking intent to propagate Confederate lost cause mythology (historical revisionism that the Confederacy's cause during the civil war was a just and heroic one) is countered by much of the film's content. There's no explicit condemnation of slavery or the confederacy but does the movie have to do this? The biggest Uncle Tom in Gone With The Wind in Scarlet O'Hara herself for doing business with the northern carpetbaggers in order to save Tara and rise above poverty. What makes Scarlett O'Hara a character I can empathize with? By many accounts, I shouldn't as she's bratty, entitled and manipulative, yet you can't help but admire her desire to survive and make better of herself despite what onlookers might say (her gumption as Margret Mitchell describes it). Scarlet is shown to have little interest in the southern cause (as does Rhett Butler). This is memorably symbolized in the shot in which war has just been announced as everyone runs frantically through the foyer of Twelve Oaks and Scarlett angrily walks by them as if they aren't even there. Really the one cause Scarlett is dedicated to is that set of her family of Irish immigrants who came to America and accomplished the American Dream of owning land ('Land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for').Gone With The Wind is one of few films in which every character, no matter how minor is significant in their own way, with Star Wars or The Ten Commandments being one of few other films which achieve this. Now if only I could do without Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), one of the most cowardly, unlikeable characters ever - and that nails on chalkboard voice! Thankfully Scarlett gives her a good slap.Then there's my boy, Rhett Butler; the cinematic embodiment alongside Han Solo and Indiana Jones of masculinity and individualism (and what an introductory shot!). Men want to be him and women want to be with him. A man out for himself and a realist doesn't really believe in the Confederate cause and is by far the most self-aware character in the film. In a defining scene Rhett points out how the south isn't equipped for war while the other southern gentlemen are blinded by illusions of grandeur and he's not afraid to call them out on it, while remaining a gentleman the whole time and removes himself from the meeting after the other gentlemen feel insulted by his comments. Even when Rhett joins the Confederate Army near the end of the war as he describes himself as having a weakness for lost causes, he's still self-aware of how foolish his actions are. Just before Rhett leaves Scarlet at the carriage after escaping from Atlanta, the film treats us to what I consider the greatest kiss in film history with its layers on intensity; melodramatic dialogue, sweeping music, and the blood-red sky.Rhett's actions do however lead to one scene which gets many viewers in a tussle; Rhett's drunken marital rape of Scarlett after she refuses to have sex with him. Not to mention Scarlett is seen the following the morning have enjoyed the experience! I don't believe however the film at all rewards or gratifies Rhett for his actions and subtlety condemns it. Not only does Rhett show remorse for his actions the following morning, but the rape is also the final act which leads to the destruction of a marriage which was already on shaky ground.Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes who is in many ways the counterpoint of Rhett Butler as the tender, effeminate, proud southerner (with a transatlantic accent, go figure). Ashley is a romantic who is crippled by his nostalgia for the old south. Ashley spends most of the film listlessly adrift through the harsher realities of the reconstruction era. Unlike Scarlett, he has no goals or ambitions for the future. All he can do is remember the elegance of his life as it once was and wish that he could return to those old days.Rounding out the film's four main cast members is Olivia de Havilland in her undersung performance as Melanie Wilkes, crossing the line of being saintly without ever being sickly. Did she know about Scarlett and Ashley or not? Was she really a saint, or just naive, or perhaps exceptionally wise? Scarlet is the sister Melanie always wanted with each of them possessing qualities the other lacked, especially during their bond over joint survival during and after the war. Scarlett saved Melanie's life and Melanie kept her cool under fire in a way that earned Scarlett's private (though reluctant) admiration. She also did not hesitate to do hard work she never would have had to touch before the war. She was, therefore, more valuable to the family's survival than Scarlett's two sisters. The speculative question of whether Melanie knew about Scarlett's obsession with Ashley. Perhaps Melanie knew she could trust Ashley while seeing that Rhett was the right man for Scarlett by trying to promote their relationship.",10,6,7,31 October 2019
JFK," No Stone Unturned
","I'm aware in modern times conspiracy theories have become detrimental in discovering the actual truth (largely thanks to the internet) but I can't deny that I just love this sort of stuff. JFK requires your utmost attention and at a runtime of three hours, it feels like the movie leaves no stone upturned (pardon the pun) in its examination and deconstruction of the Kennedy assassination. Admittedly the first time I watched JFK I didn't understand much of what is discussed in the film. It's a lot to digest in a single viewing but there are more intriguing theories here than an entire season of Ancient Aliens (minus the bad haircuts and awkward line delivery); but I can happily watch JFK multiple times to further understand it and eat up every single word of dialogue. I doubt we will ever need another film made about the Kennedy assassination; what highly talented filmmaker could be more passionate about the subject matter? I also highly recommend watching the director's cut for even more conspiracy goodness to evoke the paranoia in you.JFK is one of those movies which makes you most appreciate the art of editing, incorporating many layers of time and reels of stock footage; no scene during the movie's three hours is edited in a standard fashion. The editing help make the film's exposition exciting; a character may be describing an event as the scene cuts to just that in an obscured or dreamlike manner. The Mr. X sequence with Donald Sutherland is a perfect example of how to pull of engrossing exposition; plus is there a more classic cold war, spy movie type scene than meeting a suited man in the park to receive classified information. Likewise, John Williams' theme for JFK evokes my inner patriotic American, even if I'm not American. The militaristic and at other times conspiratorial nature of the score helps make the movie as compelling as it is. The black & white scenes such as those featuring the military feel reminiscent of Seven Days In May with shades throughout of the John Frankenheimer style. I'm sure Stone must have also taken some pointers from the first movie about the Kennedy assassination, 1973's Executive Action.JFK continues the tradition of films such as The Longest Day in which a large ensemble cast of familiar faces and great screen presences to help guide us through the story. It's amazing seeing different generations of actors doing some of the best work their careers and utilizing their screen personas to full effect even if many of them are only on screen for short spaces of time. Some of the figures in the story strike me as too bizarre to have been real-life people, especially David Ferrie and Claw Shaw.I've always been in defense of Kevin Costner against criticisms of being a dull actor. Granted his career did go downhill in mid 90's and has never fully recovered but in his heyday of the late 1980's/early 90's he was such a hot streak of films. Casting him in the role of Jim Garrison couldn't be more perfect as Costner is much like a modern-day classic movie actor in the vein of everymen like James Stewart, Henry Fonda or Gary Cooper. He's been most commonly compared to Cooper (the courtroom section of the film is reminiscent of Cooper's role in The Fountainhead) although with his southern demeanor I would compare him to being a modern-day Henry Fonda. I would defy anyone to call Costner a bad actor after watching the film's courtroom scene. Talking almost non-stop for 40 minutes and never losing my attention while exuding a stern, emotional and towards the end of the speech, a fragile voice; with his final conclusion bringing a tear to my eye.I find Jim Garrison's family life interesting itself, mostly from the relationship with his wife. What does he see in her? She does not support his endeavors, despite his noble cause and unlike her husband, she is susceptible to believing what the media tells her. Here is a man who spends the movie questioning and fighting the system yet has a wife with a conformist personality. I can't say for certain what they were like in real life but the in film I grew to dislike her character.JFK draws no conclusions, it doesn't prove who assassinated Kennedy and allows the viewer to make up their own mind. Stone may be often criticized for his use of a dramatist's license but as I say with many films based on historical events; this can make for a more compelling story. Even if there are untruths present, the film can act as a gateway to wanting to discover the real story. The movie did leave me a feeling of (good) anger and is one of the films I can credit with helping to influence the way I think.'Dedicated to the young in whose the spirit the search for truth marches on.'",10,4,10,12 April 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Once Upon a Time In Hill Valley
","While I loved Back to the Future Part II for how frantic and fast-paced it is, I love Part III for largely the opposite reason; for being more simple and laid back. You need a dark chapter like Part II before you can have something more romantic and light-hearted like Part III. I love the western setting, there's a certain innocence to it and is classic in every sense of the word. There's monument valley, cowboys, Indians, a saloon as well as the atypical western music score. It's also fun to see Marty and Doc in a date much further back in time as well as seeing the images, quotes and motifs from the first film reapplied in the western setting. The film shows us Hill Valley during its early days thus over the course of three films we get the entire history (and near future) of this town, making it a character onto itself even if the western setting does raise the question about Hill Valley's geographical location.Part III is the Doc's movie; it gave his character a whole new dimension as his scientific ethics are challenged by falling in love for the first time. I don't think many people realise it but Doc Brown is a pretty dark character. He blew his family's fortune on inventions which don't work (at least until he invented time travel) and is ostracised from the rest of Hill Valley so it's about time something finally went right in his life and he finds a love. Plus it's cute, two geeks falling in love who were previously separated by space and time for that added romantic element.My only complaint with Part III (really my only complaint with any film in the trilogy) is that the film pulls the liar revealed, one of my most dreaded of movie clichés. We know the Doc and Clara are going to get back together towards the end of the movie, so do really need to have the movie abruptly stop for a period. But I'm more forgiving of it in this instance as their separation does contribute to the suspense during the film's finale which is one of the highlights of the entire trilogy. The interactions between Marty and Doc, on the other hand, are just as great as ever, even more so that they have to find a way to get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour with the technology available to them in 1885. Although I do have to ask is Doc not going against his principles at the end by creating another time machine, oh well, it's still a great ending. Back to the Future Part III is my least favourite of the series but I still love it. Unlike other film franchises, the trilogy is done and dusted. It's not polluted with further sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, re-whatevers, and hopefully, it will stay that way.The End.",10,3,3,21 October 2015
Million Dollar Baby," Champion Film Making
","Million Dollar Baby is a movie I find works on different levels. On my first viewing, I found the majority of the film great right up until the plot's heartbreaking turn of events, it easily ranked as one of my new favourite films of all time. On second viewing, however, I found substantially even better as I was waiting in dread for the proceeding events; I mean almost literally quivering in fear knowing that dreadful scene in which Maggie falls to the ground and her neck lands on the side on a stool. Thanks to this movie I now fear the very sight of a stool. Million Dollar Baby is one of the most emotionally draining films I've ever witnessed. It's such a powerful experience I can't just immediately watch another film right away and I'll still be thinking about it for days afterward; a film so absorbing you don't want it to end. Yet the last forty minutes after Maggie Fitzgerald's life-threatening injury are so difficult to watch. Morgan's Freeman's monologue in which he tries to justify a reason to pull the plug on Maggie as she got her shot and can leave the world thinking 'I think I did alright' really made me appreciate being alive.I don't know if it was the filmmaker's intent but I certainly get the impression Million Dollar Baby has a pro-assisted suicide message which will rub many people the wrong way. I will point out though I'm not against movies containing a message which supports a point of view, regardless of my views on the issue at hand as this (on top of making more people aware of an issue) can create a vocal point of discussion as well as being thought-provoking.Eastwood has only become better over time, delivering an amazing streak of directorial efforts during throughout the 2000's, with stories of unpretentious human emotion. His direction on Million Dollar Baby (as well as many of his other films) is astounding in how he makes the art of filmmaking look easy. It amazes me the effectiveness of his films despite their simplistic (at least on the surface level) and humble nature. Never has the presence of a fighter training in a darkly lit gym ever looked so immaculate. Likewise, Eastwood can combine serious drama and subtle humor perfectly. I love his smart-alecky sense of humor such as the scenes in which he annoys a priest for his own amusement or my personal favourite moment, Eastwood and Freeman's conversation about socks. Not to mention Morgan Freeman's narration is pure heaven to listen too, never as exposition been pleasurable. If only Morgan Freeman could narrate my life. I know its easy to throw around the 'M' word, but in this instance, I will use it. Million Dollar Baby is nothing short of a masterpiece.",10,0,4,20 October 2014
Singin' in the Rain," That's Entertainment!
","What is about Singin' in the Rain that even the film elite hold it in such high regard and has even appeared on a previous Sight & Sound poll as one of the ten greatest films of all time, ranking among traditional highbrow films? Singin' in the Rain is not just a great musical but also a film with a great story. It is not as harsh a critique on Hollywood as Sunset Boulevard but who would have still believed the content of fan magazines to be genuine after this film. Singin' in the Rain has a cynical side as it pulls apart the Hollywood myth; beginning with Don Lockwood's back-story as to how he rose to fame, which the movie comically shows us is full of crap. 'Dignity, always dignity' but not if you want to make it to the top but at the end of the day Singin' in the Rain is a movie for movie lovers which celebrates Hollywood as much as it makes fun of it.The film is set in 1927 albeit a very colourful 1927. In 1952 Technicolor films were in their final years of production and would soon become a thing of the past. The movie is a tribute to MGM producer and songwriter Arthur Freed - head of the MGM Freed unit - the producers of some of the greatest film musicals of all time. Although the days of the studio system where coming to an end in the early 1950's as films from different studios started becoming homogenous and not containing unique aesthetics to each studio, the MGM musical still remained its own unique beast that no other studio could replicate. Likewise, the film studio in Singin' in the Rain is a fictional studio and not MGM itself, I guess that would have been too much of a self-endorsement.The soundtrack itself has entered the pop culture lexicon for good reason. I've had no shortage of listening to my CD soundtrack; glorious corn and camp topped with beautiful orchestrations, all of which never leaves your head and contributing to making Singin' in the Rain one of the go-to anti-depressant films. Few other songs can lift my mood more than Moses Supposes or the film's title number: could there be a greater expression of joy? After all, it is in the title; he is singing in the rain; turning the dreary rain into carefree joy, finding joy in despair. As for Make 'em Laugh, even though it is a plagiarism of Cole Porter's Be a Clown from The Pirate (1948), I considering Make 'em Laugh is a superior rendition. There is also that disorienting fashion parade sequence which could be removed and have no effect on the plot but I do love me some 50's fluff. But they do save the best for last in the form of the Broadway Melody Ballet. A number of MGM musicals had a lengthy ballet sequence, and to say they outdid themselves here would be an understatement as Gene Kelly dressed as Harold Lloyd with the go-getter attitude of the 1920's celebrates a simple notion, 'gotta dance!'. The visually asserting array of bright colours and impressionistic backgrounds is aided by Cyd Charisse; what a talent, what a figure!Singin' in the Rain presents a light-hearted and comical look at what actors and studios went through during the transition to sound. Few other scenes in cinema are as entertaining as Lina Lomant's failure to understand sound recording technology. This scene not only showcases the problems with the technology in its early days by picking up unwanted sounds (complete also with the classic angry movie director) but it perfectly captures the relatable frustration that comes with filmmaking. I can tell you there is nothing more frustrating than out-of-sync sound. Likewise, the star's difficulty in adapting to talkies and being laughed at by audiences parallel the legend of audiences being in howls of laughter as actor John Gilbert's attempts to deliver dialogue on screen. Jean Hagan playing the dumb broad Lina Loment does a comedy act similar to Judy Holiday but in my view better than Holiday ever did. Donald O'Connor on the other hand surely isn't human with his vaudeville-style act his facial and body movements and ability to walk up walls. Just name me a film with a more astounding display of talent. Here's to you Singin' In the Rain, I bow humbly to your cinematic and musical perfection.",10,1,2,4 February 2017
Avatar," Pandora's Box of Vacuosity
","I went into Avatar with hopes of it being an intelligent science fiction movie, James Cameron has directed two of my favourite movies of all time, Terminator 2 and Titanic, but I remain convinced all he was interested in this movie was the special effects, and not giving second thought to story or characters despite the film being in production for a decade.One aspect of Avatar which bothers me which I've never heard other reviewers comment upon is the fact that Sam Worthington's character of Jake Sully is paralyzed, being confined to a wheelchair at the beginning of the movie. However when he becomes an avatar and is not only is he able to walk in this new form, he's running and jumping through the forests of Pandora, so why is there no sense of liberation? Why is this character confined to a wheelchair if the movie never takes advantage of this as a definable characteristic? Am I only person who looked beyond the movie's special effects and actually noticed this guy is in a wheelchair, even in the movie's trailer we can see he's in a wheelchair, and I thought to myself, 'Wow, a protagonist in an action movie who is in a wheelchair , that's something you don't see every day', but no, the wheelchair is there for no reason, if he wasn't paralyzed it would have made no difference to his character, or should I say 'character', since no one in this movie has a personality.Even more bothersome for me however is Colonel Milies Quaritch (and yes I had to go to Wikipedia to find out his name as the characters in this movie suck), or as I like to call him, Generic Army General Guy. This is one of the absolute worst, most uninspired villains I have ever seen. This villain alone proves that James Cameron spent a decade working on the technology for this movie's special effects and didn't give a monkey's about the story or characters. I was that shocked at how cliché this villain is that I can't even enjoy him in an ironic sense, instead, I just sat there in bemusement at a villain who belongs in a spoof movie, heck even 80's action movies have better villains.Of course, I'm not going to beat the dead horses' skeleton regarding the movie's white guilt plot. I know humanity will always have its flaws and perhaps it just the optimist in me would like to imagine that in the year 2154 we would have learned something by then and won't be colonizing other inhabited planets because of greed, but if the movie at least made some acknowledgement of the actions in the film being a case of history repeating itself and even act as a cautionary tale, I would have been more forgiving.I don't like CGI to begin with, it's one of biggest complaints about modern filmmaking, but I do acknowledge the technology can be put to good use when put in the right hands. The effects in Avatar are impressive, but to quote George Lucas (I'll presume he said this before he himself completely lost it), 'a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.'",3,3,6,20 October 2014
Rocky," The Philadelphia Story
","I may sound like a bit of a fanboy when I talk about the Rocky franchise but I just legitimately love all these movies so much. This is a series which always inspires me and has aided me during my darkest days. Rocky was one of the first movies to have such a profound impact on me, making me appreciate cinema on a deeper level. I first saw Rocky on TV and week after week came back to watch the sequels; such joy I had and memories I never forget.I don't think there is a fictional character whom I've been more emotionally invested in than Rocky Balboa. Could there be a character who is more honest or down to Earth? A man who has next to nothing yet has such a positive outlook on life ('Naw I ain't got no phone, I had to pull it you know because people calling me all the time, and who needs the aggravation, right?' - such profound wisdom). The character is also a mystery and an enigma; who are his parents and what about his early years? Apart from a few brief snippets of information, it's up to the viewer's imagination instead of giving us a pointless origin story which Hollywood is so keen on nowadays. The character is biographical of his creator Sylvester Stallone throughout the whole series; his fictional alter ego. Just like Rocky, Stallone had next to nothing before making it as a star. Just like how the character rises to the challenge against impossible odds, the movie also beat impossible odds by becoming one of the biggest sleeper hits of all time. Likewise what movie or character is more identified with a city or has such reverence for the location it was filmed.All the films in the series reflect the periods in which they were made. It's 1976, America's Bicentennial year. Perhaps the country didn't know it needed an injection of optimism after years of cynical and pessimistic film as well as political upheaval. Don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for cynicism in movies but with such movies dominating the mainstream at the time it was clear that enough was enough. It seems like happy endings where against the law in the first half of the 70's, but Rocky brought them back for better or worse, and film snobs will look down on it for that. But yes, I do blubber away at this ending and Adrian's uttering of 'I love you!' is the greatest 'I love you!' in cinema history. The ending has that same feeling of joy and happiness as seen in the ending of many Frank Capra movies. Speaking of Capra, Rocky's response to being asked if he wants to fight Apollo Creed for the world heavyweight championship is like Gary Cooper in Mr Deeds Goes to Town when he is told of the vast sum of money he has inherited.As the filmmakers didn't get permission to shot for many of the on locations, guerilla filmmaking techniques where employed in the making of Rocky; capturing the streets of Philadelphia in all their glory with that distinctive that gritty look of 70's films while aided with the use of the then-new technology in the form of the steady cam. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie which is more naturalistic and unmanufactured as Rocky.It's astounding that such a low budget film could have had such a great soundtrack and score. Bill Conti's score to Rocky always makes me feel melancholic; the Rocky soundtracks have given me hours upon hours of listening pleasure. I even watch the end credits of all the films for the music (well except the first one as the end credit music here is quite dreary). The Rocky movies are also responsible for my love of montages. I'll never forget the feeling of exuberance I felt watching the film's training montage for the first time and hearing Gonna Fly Now; we're talking the goosiest of goosebumps.Roger Ebert compared Stallone to Marlon Brando in his original review, and in 1976 no one could have seen this man being a future action movie star, but I maintain the man is more intelligent than people make him out to be. He's made a respectable career out of what he is capable of doing. How many people can claim to have been able to write installments in a film series which has lasted four decades and still manage to keep the long-running story interesting? During the filming of Rocky, he had to do script rewrites on the spot such as upon discovering the ice rink for Rocky and Adrian's was completely empty or the shorts on the giant poster of Rocky in the stadium where the wrong colour.When I watched this film at a younger age, I never fully appreciated the romantic angle, yet watching it from a more mature perspective. Rocky and Adrian are like two misfits who don't fully fit in with the rest of society. There is a goddess with Adrian, and only Rocky can see it. The scene in which Rocky invites Adrian to his apartment after their first date took my breath away like few other love scenes have ever done. The sexuality on display is immense with Stallone in a vest and the gradual build-up to their first kiss, and I'm sure they did it.The world of Rocky is populated with such unforgettable characters. Rocky's trainer Mickey Goldmill is one of the greatest mentors in film history (either him or Obi-Wan Kenobi in my book) with his grouchy and curmudgeon manner. I feel Burgess Meredith is an actor who got better with age, so no surprise his most famous role came to him at the age of 68. Paulie (Burt Young) is one pathetic hateful loser, abuses his sister, is violent and yet you can't help but feel sorry for him. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) on the other hand, dam! What a showman with his charisma, confidence, cockiness, and ego; the archetype of a leading man from a blacksploitation film. Yet despite being a black man, he is surely one of the most patriotic characters ever put on screen who shuns any left wing mentality of victimhood; sounds like a dam monster movie!One more recent viewings of Rocky I've also come to appreciate Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell) more as a character. A charismatic loan shark who employs Rocky and has a real liking for him, giving him money for his date, attends his fight with Apollo and doesn't try to take over his boxing career whereas many other mobsters would. Yet Rocky's lenient collecting style by refusing to break the thumbs of clients who don't pay up causes problems for Gazzo yet he treats Rocky almost like a brother. It shouldn't come as a surprise then that in the original script for the film, Rocky and Gazzo where brothers.When Rocky visits the empty arena before the fight you can feel the pressure and weight that bestows him. By the time the final fight comes around I'm so emotionally invested in this character that I'm rooting for him like it's a real fight. During the fight itself, the punches look real and there's no sped up footage like boxing films of the past; while Bill Conti's score ups the intensity and suspense for some serious emotional impact.",10,1,1,24 March 2018
Rocky III," Rocky III: An American Tradition
","After the recap of the fight from the previous movie, Rocky III opens with a montage which begins with fireworks and giant light up sign of Rocky as if to say 'Welcome to the 80's!'; a decade when everything was larger than life. The song of choice is Eye of Tiger, the montage is edited like an MTV music video and Rocky even appears on The Muppet Show; and all that merchandise, me want!Rocky III is ridiculously entertaining while still managing to have thematic substance. Rocky is no longer struggling with fame. A man who couldn't film a simple commercial in Rocky II is now making all sorts of endorsements. He could barely drive a car in Rocky II, now he can now drive with ease. Rocky has also become a more intelligent man instead of the dum dum he was in first two movies. Not to mention does he looks different, very handsome I might add and in such physical shape. I think Stallone looks like Al Pacino here, especially when wearing a suit.Rocky III brought the series in a different direction, distant from the first two movies. But despite Rocky's wealth and fame, Rocky III is not a movie which cheapens out. The primary theme of the movie is about Rocky's fame making him soft or as Mickey puts it, 'You got civilised'. Once Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters his seemingly perfect bubble of a life is burst; 'You wake up after a few years, thinking you're a winner, but you're not, you're really a loser'. This continues the series theme of being semi-autobiographical of Stallone's own life as the movie examines what fame and fortune can do to a person. Adrian's role is smaller is time round although her character still sees an evolution as the famous lifestyle has taken away her shyness and made her more outspoken and pretty hot too I might add. Just listen to the words of motivation she gives Rocky on the beach; a far cry from the Adrian in the first movie.Even when Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters prior to his first fight with Clubber Lang, Rocky is training in the most superficial gym. It's full of photographers and visitors, musicians are playing and merchandise is being sold. Unsurprisingly he gets the worst beating of his life at the hands of Clubber Lang. The solution to Rocky getting his so-called 'eye of the tiger' back; get away from the superficiality of his wealthy lifestyle and back to the nitty-gritty. As Apollo Creed puts it, 'Man, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger man, the edge! And the only way to get it back is to go back to the beginning; you know what I'm saying?'. I stick by these words as some of the wisest words I've heard uttered in a motion picture. Whenever you lose your mindset of determination whether physically or mentality, go back to where you first started in order to reclaim it. Rocky III humanises Apollo Creed with Rocky and Apollo becoming friends being a great spin on the story. I always think of his intense shouting of 'There is no tomorrow!' whenever I need some motivation.The hypnotic, uneasy music which plays when Rocky is training poorly under Apollo and stuck with the threat of living with failure reminds me of Bernard Herman's score to Vertigo in possibly the most uneasy scenes in the series. Likewise, the scene of Paulie in the arcade has to be the most surreal scene in the entire series in which he throws a bottle pinball machine in slow motion complete with odd sound effects; it's an image which doesn't leave your head.Mr. T as Clubber Lang, oh man! What a beast! A true larger than life villain with outbursts of immensely entertaining lightning fast dialogue; he sure has a way with words with such a violent temper and high levels of anger. You do not want to be stuck in an elevator with this guy. Which raises the question; is Clubber responsible for the death of Mickey by pushing him to the side? Yet even close to death Mickey can still inspire with scenery-chewing words of motivation; his death being one of the series most emotional moments. The boxer vs. wrestler charity fight on the other hand between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) has nothing to do with the rest of the movie but dam is it entertaining. It's so over the top with such intense pain on display. The referee and police officers are thrown to the side, the audience is assaulted and even Paulie gets in on the action (I do love those bits of humour Paulie provides).The final fight in Rocky III is the only in ring fight in the series which takes place in real time until Creed. Meanwhile, the final scene of the movie is such fun, with Rocky and Apollo playing off each other which along with the training montage gives off some homoerotic vibes along the way with sweaty, shirtless, muscular men in tank tops as well as men hugging and jumping in the sea.Also, the film's trailer refers to Rocky III as an 'American tradition'. What's the tradition? Hollywood sequels?",10,5,6,17 August 2016
It's a Wonderful Life," It Happened One Christmas
","Why yes I do cry like a baby over it's a Wonderful Life: every time. That ending is such a huge release after such as a dark and depressing alternative reality. I'm always left shaken up by it and need a break before I can watch another movie as well as making me want to make amends with loved ones. I'm sure everyone who watched It's a Wonderful Life thinks to themselves what the world would be like if they were never born. The struggle of George Bailey is relatable to a wide spectrum, and I know for myself it really hits home. Being stuck in a dead-end town and feeling you will bust if you don't get away from it; having your life not going the way you intended it to while your siblings appear to be doing so much better than you. But in at the end George Bailey realises what he's got when it's all gone, above it all, God's greatest gift. It's a Wonderful Life takes placed in a world in which God exists (and can focus his time on this one person over the rest of the world, but I digress). I've never felt however for It's a Wonderful Life to have a religious agenda, it's merely just a plot device for the film's fantasy elements.Lionel Barrymore's performance as Henry F. Potter I feel is a tie between his brother John's roles in Twentieth Century as the best performance from the Barrymore clan. Potter is one of the biggest douche bags in movie history; the archetype evil business mogul and ripe for comparisons with real-life figures. Not only has he no charitable side, he directly steals money in order to destroy his competition. Unlike other screen villains, Potter does not get any comeuppance at the end of the film, although you could say he's destiny as a sick, frustrated and lonely man who hates anyone that has anything he can't have is punishment enough. Potter isn't a total caricature though, he is more three dimensional than that. He's a man who knows how to conduct and run a business and understands that high ideals without common sense could ruin a town. But George Bailey is no fool, he is a natural born leader, even if he doesn't realise it. He stands up to Potter without giving it a second thought, runs a building and loan which is a real estate empire itself; even his father states to him that he was born older than his brother.Moments like the makeshift honeymoon suite in the broken down house which they later make their own or the recurring gag with the mantle at the end of the stairway represents the kind of writing which elevates It's a Wonderful Life above the majority of other movies. Like the greatest of films, you notice something new on every viewing. Likewise, nobody can do moments of intimacy like Frank Capra, the movie is full of scenes in which it is simply two actors talking with no background music, yet creates raw human emotions like no other. Take a scene such as George and Mary walking through a neighbourhood at night while George talks about his ambitions for the future, the rest of the world ceases to exist. Many will be quick to put down Capra's work as so-called 'Capracorn' or as Potter puts it, 'sentimental hogwash'. Get off your high horse and stop thinking you're above such emotion - cinema is about the manipulation of emotions.It's hard not to feel sentimental for the representation of small-town America on display. Bedford Falls itself is a town full of interesting and unique characters. It actually reminds me of The Simpsons. Potter himself is essentially the town's own Mr. Burns in The Simpsons - the people of Springfield hate Burns but are dependent on him for their energy needs. Likewise, the people of Bedford Falls hate Potter and would be dependent on him for their housing if it wasn't for the competition of the Bailey Building & Loan.Due to its public domain status, the film was shown on some TV networks in 24-hour marathons. I'd happily watch one of those networks as I can't stop watching It's a Wonderful Life no matter what point in the movie I begin. Could you get a more perfect marriage between actor and director than James Stewart and Frank Capra? Collaborating on a perfect trilogy of films, with each one better than the last. It's a Wonderful Life? It sure is.",10,4,7,22 July 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," The Big House
","The Shawshank Redemption is a movie which is hypnotising in just how good it is. You know the type of film; whenever it's on TV (which in this case it constantly is) you have to stop what you're doing and watch it - one of those rare movies in which you don't want to end. With the all the movies out there in which you find yourself checking how long is left of the running time, here is one in which you see there is a whole hour left and you're glad; the mark of a truly great movie.Carcerophobia is the fear of going to prison and is something which has crossed my mind in the past, partially brought on by movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Even if you've committed nothing illegal like Andy Dufresne, there is always that possibility that an honest law-abiding citizen could end up in the slammer. The world of Shawshank State Penitentiary is one with little to no human rights, one with shocking but believable treatment from both the guards and fellow prisoners as they engage in brutal, sadistic acts. Regardless of what prisons around the world are like circa 2017, your 'whole life (is) blown away in the blink of an eye, nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it'. The Shawshank Redemption may be one of Stephen King's non-horror works, but the prospect of going to prison for a crime you never committed gets under my skin.One of the aspects of The Shawshank Redemption which intrigues me the most in the empire Andy builds while inside prison as well as an insight of the economics and commerce which goes on between the prisoners and guards. Just like Robert Stroud in Birdman of Alcatraz, he is still able to find meaning in his life despite being in what first looks like a hopeless situation; he is able to find hope in despair. This really does show that at the end of the day, knowledge is power. Likewise, Andy sending a letter every week to the state government for prison library funding and ultimately playing with the system, always something which inspires me.What makes Andy Dufresne such a great character? Like Tim Robbins himself, there is more than meets the eye. Robins has an intelligence to him and you can't quite figure out what is going on behind his eyes, an actor with a mysterious aura to him and this comes through with the character of Andy. He is not like the rest of the prisoners, he's a civilised gentleman thrown into the jungle that is prison but he's not a sheltered fool ether and knows how to deal with his new surroundings. But why do I need to tell you this, the narration sums up his character perfectly in a beautiful and poetic manner - 'I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.' Likewise, I also find myself very intrigued by the character of Brooks; just how does such a gentle soul end up in prison? Did he really commit a crime? Who knows?Morgan Freeman has the ability to play wise old men without coming off as a stereotype or a cliché. His narration is describing what obviously appears in the film, so what makes it so great? Like the best film narration, it's to do with its poetic manner and the way in which it's delivered; scenes in the film were shot to time with the pre-recorded voice over plus it goes without saying Freeman has one of the most heavenly voices ever. None of his dialogue is necessary for the advancement of the plot, yet what would the film be without it? There are just so many inspirational quotes.The escape sequence itself so incredible yet at the same time is entirely believable and one of the most satisfying movie revenge plots. Many people always point out as to how Andy could reattach the poster to the wall when he begins his escape through the tunnel, even Frank Darabont acknowledges this on the DVD audio commentary although I am puzzled as to why this is made into a big deal. Andy could simply attach the poster to the wall at the top two corners and allow gravity to cover the remainder of the hole and simply crawl into it from below as if the poster where a curtain, likewise we never see on screen if the poster has been reattached on all four corners.When I think of films which can convey an expansive range of powerful human emotions and feelings and act as a form of emotional therapy a few instantly come to my mind - It's a Wonderful Life, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. Films which help one to break from the mental prisons of our life.",10,0,0,7 July 2017
Back to the Future Part II," It's a Wonderful Future
","Back to the Future Part II is one of the most relentless films I've ever seen. A one hour and forty minute film yet it feels like only a fraction of that length. As the characters are already introduced to us, the movie immediately gets the ball rolling. I love how frantic and faced paced Part II is; the movie almost never pauses and is one hell of a thrill ride. How many movie sequels return to the events of the first film? I can't imagine the effort that went into recreating the scenes from the first film from different perspectives, it makes you see the first film in a whole different light. The film's portrayal of 2015, on the other hand, is the future we all wish we could have, unlike most movies which predict a future of doom and gloom. I still want those self-tying shoelaces and the pizza which can be cooked with a few seconds - its fun watching all those future gizmos. Although they got some things right; the large, flat, wide screen TV with multiple channels or the market for nostalgia with the Cafe 80's.Part II takes The Empire Strikes Back route by being darker than the first film; the alternate 1985 is like an even darker version of It's a Wonderful Life. Part II is Biff's movie; while he doesn't have the most complex personality. What makes him such a great character is all the different incarnations he has from different ages, timelines as well as his relatives. Thomas F. Wilson has by far the juiciest role in the film, playing no less than five variations of the same character and even having the young Biff interact with the old Biff. I find it funny that the universe could get destroyed just because this one guy has to be an asshole. Also, I'm not the first person to notice this but it's dawned on me how much the alternate 1985 Biff looks like Donald Trump. If the first Back to the Future showed the good side of capitalism: this movie shows the bad side of capitalism.Back to the Future Part II is one of the best examples I've seen of single actors playing multiple roles and how they seamlessly have them appear side by side and interact with each other. It still makes me wonder how they did those effects. Today, of course, they would be achieved using CGI but not back then and that's part of the fun of these effects - on top of being cool to look at - you find yourself asking 'how did they do that?' Robert Zemeicks had just directed the technically challenging Who Framed Rodger Rabbit and then directed a film as complex as this followed by directing the third Back to the Future; someone had a busy set of years working. They also got a new actress for the role of Jennifer and even then they manage to make the change in casting appear seamless.Part II is by far the most and I do mean by far the most complex of the trilogy, these movies seriously screw with your head if you think about them too much. For example, (presuming time travel exists) if you go to the future you can't actually meet your future self, as you skipped the intervening time period by travelling forward in time, your older self would not exist in that timeline; instead you would find your loved ones mourning over the day you disappeared or how about when old Biff returns to the future after giving his younger self the almanac, should he not have returned the future which he changed? I'll admit the first time I saw it I found the plot a bit confusing; it took me a number of viewings until I finally figured out why the old Biff is in pain when he returns to 2015. I don't see these inaccuracies as a bad thing if anything they strengthen our love for these films. Part of the fun of the trilogy is discussing the time travel mechanics and trying to find explanations for any possible inaccuracy. Also one other thing I've always wondered, why does Marty make no effort to protect the letter from the rain when his life depends on it? The scene in which Doc tries to explain to Marty that they are in an alternative 1985 must have been similar to the interactions between Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale when they were writing this film.To Be Concluded...",10,3,4,21 October 2015
Ben-Hur," When In Rome...
","Metro Goldwyn Mayer hadn't created a production this big since Gone with The Wind some twenty years earlier. Ben-Hur was created with the intent of lifting the studio out of financial trouble, yet somehow along the way art managed to be created. With the gloriously pompous opening credits set to the backdrop of The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo and the booming horns of Miklos Rozsa's score, the stage is set. During the early scenes of Ben-Hur, I get the satisfaction of knowing that everything in front of the camera is real and had to be assembled, such as every single extra in those trails of Roman soldiers which go back as far as the eye can see. Ben-Hur was William Wyler's Cecil B. DeMille picture, well certainly thematically. Technologically Ben-Hur is an incredibly different film to those made by DeMille. The films of DeMille's where largely staged despite their epic scope which does work in its own way and while I'm not trying to dismiss The Ten Commandments (it is my favourite biblical epic) it can't be denied Wyler is a far superior craftsman and that comes through in Ben-Hur; his filling of the frame is more rich and vibrant with a great sense of depth of field. At nearly four hours long, Ben-Hur is the perfect example of how to pace a movie of long length; it feels shorter than it is.Ben-Hur was only one of a handful of movies shot using the MGM Camera 65; an extremely wide aspect ratio. The wide lens is not just for grand sweeping shots, it helps make the intimate, close up moments more immense and make the actors more godlike. Any close up of only one actor in the middle of the frame with an out of focus background looks majestic. Ben-Hur seems to be a movie largely remembered for just its spectacle, which is a shame. It is also a movie of rich layered vibrancy, evoking the senses and full of emotion.The story also includes that age-old idea of one's destiny being by a seemingly insignificant event. If that tile didn't fall off the roof during the Roman parade and killed the governor then things may have turned out very differently. I also love Jack Hawkins' words of 'You have the spirit to fight back, but a good sense to control it', and '(hate) That's good, hate keeps a man alive; it gives him strength'; two more additions to my book of life advice from movie quotes.People will be quick to dismiss Charlton Heston as a ham actor. He's a classically trained actor, over the top and boisterous at times (in a good way) but so was Laurence Oliver yet everyone gives him a free pass; I guess when you're the star of mainstream, blockbuster films then you don't garner as much respect. The style of acting is not everyone's cup of tea, but I relish in it.One of the reasons why the famous chariot race is so great is because the action is real; people were actually put in danger's way for the creation of art. There is no music during the race; just primarily the sound effects of the chariots and horses storming across the ground with the cheers from the immense crowd of spectators nor was any rear screen projections used; it's all the real deal. The filmmakers brought 2,000 years ago back to life; nine minutes of cinema history in which your eyes are truly glued to the screen; the chariot race is one of the reasons why the 1959 film version of Ben-Hur will always be the definitive version. If anyone thinks they can do a chariot race which is better then they are fooling themselves. Imagine if Hollywood remade Ben-Hur with a CGI chariot race, that would be really awful, wouldn't it? Oh wait, never mind. The ship battle sequence on the other hand, while superb I do feel the battle in the 1925 version of Ben-Hur is more effective in which lifeboats full of extras were used rather than the remake's use of miniatures and rear projection shots. Not to mention the 1925 sequence is more brutal, with people being tied to the front of ships and snakes are catapulted into enemy boats.Even as someone who is not religious I can't deny the power of the film's religious moments such as the scene of Jesus giving Judah water and the Roman guard being unable to whip him, and even the birth of Jesus appears very dreamlike. Even the use of miracles as a device to resolve plot points doesn't hurt my enjoyment of the film such as the section of the movie at the Leper colony; a powerful and disturbing pair of sequences in which people segregated from the rest of society with a debilitating illness. Yet is it not an easy way out when the leprosy of Judah's mother and sister are cured instantly via a miracle? Regardless, such use of Deus Ex Machina does not hurt my enjoyment of Ben-Hur.",10,2,2,16 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Next Generation
","I find it harder with every passing year to take an interest in new release movies, and even I was more interested in newer films I would need them to sink in before reviewing. However, this is Star Wars we're talking about! When it was first announced back in 2012 that a new trilogy of Star Wars movies was to be made, my initial reaction was 'It will be better than the prequels, but will still suck'. The filmmakers had the gargantuan task of winning back all the cynical, jaded Star Wars fans like myself; I don't think many people were jumping for joy when a new trilogy was announced. As more announcements about Episode VII came to light such as the film's apparent use of practical effects and that it was going to be shot on film I compared it to a politician making false election promises; in other words, it's a trap! Then came the first teaser and I couldn't complain. It actually looks like what I want a Star Wars film to look like, but no, I'm not getting sucked in that easy! With the second teaser, I finally gave up; 'shut up and take my money!'. While counting down the days towards this film's release my love for Star Wars was reawakened.I almost love The Force Awakens, I almost think it's an excellent film. 80% of aspects in the film I am over the moon about and exceeded my expectations; 20% I am indifferent towards. As the movie begins there is no 20th Century Fox fanfare, but the silence over the LucasFilm logo works in its own way; plus at least there isn't an insane amount of opening logos like most movies today. As soon as I seen 'A long time ago...' and the opening crawl I was in full goosebumps mode. Although why does the crawl state 'Episode VII' when the marketing does not? Due to this, I expected the crawl not to state the episode number, which means they're acknowledging the prequels as canon, but whatever, those are in the past. The text in the crawl was perfect and the opening shot of a star destroyer hovering over a planet in the background, such striking imagery. The opening with the attack on the Jakku village actually reminded me of Apocalypse Now, surprisingly intense and even a bit violent. When Finn has the blood of another stormtrooper draped over his helmet, I already became emotionally invested in this character, and I haven't even seen his face; if that's not impressive then I don't know what is. The landscapes of Jakku themselves had that sense of Laurence of Arabia grandeur and those shots of the downed star destroyers in the background are poster worthy material.From the trailers, I got the impression the movie achieves the right balance between offering nostalgia but also giving us something new. The classic characters aren't just there for nostalgia's sake but they actually have important roles in the story. However if you told me that I would be raving more about the new characters as opposed to revisiting the old characters, I would have had the reaction of 'yeah right!'. I can't decide which character I love the most. Daisy Ridley without a doubt steals the show while her banter with Finn couldn't be more fun to watch. Poe Dameron on the other hand, what a cool MF. He's not necessarily the most complex character but he doesn't have to be. He has that adventure serial, flyboy, pretty boy type charm; a guy you would just love to hang out with.Captain Phasma, dam! I remember when I first saw her in the second trailer my instant reaction was, 'Wow! that is freakin' badass!'. She has the same type of appeal Boba Fett has, a 'man with no name' type who has few lines and only appears in a handful of scenes but leaves an indelible impression. I know this will sound like sacrilege to Star Wars fans but screw it, Captain Phasma > Boba Fett. I also loved the other notable villain General Hux, a character who is one dimensional in the best possible way. He's just so delightfully evil and his speech on Star Killer Base in which he lays on the full Nazi vibes gave me the chills. I'm so glad they brought back the British bad guys, one of many aspects of Star Wars sorely missed in the prequels. To me, Star Wars isn't Star Wars without generals with sinister English accents.I wonder if Kylo Ren is intended to be a satire on fanboyism with his extreme idolisation of Darth Vader. Talk about a villain you feel sorry for, you condone his actions but completely understand why he does what he does. But what really fascinates me about Kylo Ren is the fact that he's a whiny teenager, and when you think whinny teenager and Star Wars you probably think of Anakin Skywalker in Episodes II and III - except Kylo Ren is Anakin Skywalker done right. With Kylo Ren being the son of Han and Leia I can now say the Star Wars saga is a soap opera centered on the Skywalker/Solo family, making Star Wars the only soap opera to date I can say I like (well from Part IV onwards). Which brings me to my next point, Han Solo died! My favourite movie character of all time, killed by his own son. As soon as Han steps on that platform with no hand railings and a chasm below him I just knew this is it, he's going to die. Chewie's roar in response to witnessing Han's death says it all; Han Solo (1977-2015). Luke Skywalker, on the other hand, is in the film at the very end for about 20-30 seconds and doesn't speak, yet his appearance in the movie is still strangely satisfying. This along with Han's death shows this movie has balls, and I respect it so much for that.The Force Awakens is the darkest Star Wars film to date, even more than The Empire Strikes Back, but they still manage to counter this with the lightheartedness and the humour. Speaking of humour, I can say this is the funniest Star Wars film to date. Rey knowing more about the Falcon than Han and BB8's using a lighter to give a thumbs up, comic brilliance.So what am I indifferent about in The Force Awakens? One of my issues with is the CGI standing out among the practical effects. The character of Maz Khanta for example, she seems like an interesting character but her computer-generated appearance takes me out of the film. Couldn't she be a puppet or a person in a costume? I feel the character's appearance could and should have been accomplished with practical effects. Yoda was a puppet in Episode I and CGI in Episode II, perhaps this trilogy could do this in reverse? Granted I am a practical effects purist (and of course I am overjoyed by the film's extensive use of practical effects), and any use of CGI in a movie which is a follow up to a trilogy features the greatest and most memorable practical effects in cinema history is going to stand out. When I first saw Supreme Leader Snoke I was almost about to lose it. Are you kidding me? A giant humanoid who is 100s of feet tall in Star Wars? It was like nuke the fridge all over again. However, when we see Snoke is a giant hologram, I had a huge sigh of relief and even thought 'that's actually pretty clever'. However, I do still find his CGI appearance to be problematic. I also wasn't keen on Han escape scene; the CGI creature appeared rather generic and the action in the scene itself was not well executed.The John Williams score itself does not particularly stand out. While it's always nice to hear classic Star Wars themes again, the new compositions aside from Rey's Theme are not very memorable. They get the job done but I doubt you'll find yourself humming them like every piece of music in the original trilogy. Although the truth I wasn't expecting any of the new compositions to stand out as John Williams hasn't composed a truly great film score in my opinion since Catch Me If You Can.Perhaps the film's biggest fault is that it will never be the original trilogy, it will always be in its shadow; well for me at least anyway. The Force Awakens may grow on me more with when I see the bigger picture unveiled with the next two films, but I can say two hours flew by. I did check the time once, but because I didn't want it to end. I was craving answers and wanted more. The movie leaves questions unanswered and lets your imagination fill in the blanks, unlike the prequels which spoon-fed information. I still want to see The Force Awakens again. Reviewing any Star Wars film is no easy task as I could literally write pages and pages of thoughts. Just like the original trilogy, I could take any scene and talk about it in depth and talk about every little moment or touch I loved.In short: Star Wars is back baby!",9,2,8,24 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Greatest Story Ever Told
","Reviewing the might that is Star Wars; part of me wonders if there is even any point. You know that cliché review term 'what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before?' Should I pretend its 1977 and I'm just back from the movie theatre - if only I could have experienced it firsthand. With the hype underway for the upcoming The Force Awakens, I've been rekindling my love for Star Wars (the good trilogy, not the crummy one) so allow me to be the zillionth person to give their own perspective on Star Wars. Before I had ever even seen Star Wars I felt like I had watched it before. You could probably recreate the film from the parodies it has received. It's hard not to get caught up in a five-hour conversation about these movies and talking in depth about every single frame. From the archetypes, the plot structure, the glorified B movie tropes and the inspirations coming from the Bible to ancient mythology to westerns to Japanese Samurai films; Star Wars is the story of stories.I can't help by getting tearful over the beauty of the original trilogy; whether it's the introduction of Luke Skywalker to the achingly beautiful John William's score, or Luke and Leia's scene in which they try to get away from oncoming Star Troopers by swinging on a rope over a drop - but not before she kisses him - such a classic image taken from any swashbuckler. The sights and sounds of lasers blasting or dogfights in space have an aesthetic and a charm which I could never tire from. What makes the Star Wars universe feel so human? There is advanced technology but it feels used and it doesn't always function properly. Also, I'll say it now and I'll say it again: CGI isn't anything on practical effects. Part of me doesn't want to know how they did these effects just to be kept alive the thought of 'how did they do that?!' I can still enjoy the special editions despite the changes (it would take a lot more CGI to entirely ruin a film like this), yet the original theatrical versions do have a charming, 70's hokeyness (particularly during the Mos Eisley scenes and the final assault on the Death Star), which the special editions take away.What imagination or imaginations can come up with something so wonderful, which raises the question of just how much of genius within Star Wars can be actually credited to George Lucas? Is the guy an untalented hack who got lucky by being surrounded by talented people? It's disheartening to think the man may never have been the genius we all thought he once was making the man as much of an enigma as the fictional universe he came up with.Is Mark Hamill's performance in the original Star Wars the greatest? No, but I feel it works in the trilogy's favour as his performances in Empire and Jedi are much improved just like how the character of Luke matured and even within the original Star Wars by itself, I do get a sense of enjoyment from how charmingly amateurish Hamill's performance is. Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan, however, is by far the most tender performance ever given by an actor in a Star Wars film; the comforting mentor and father figure who is wise without any pretension. Also what gives C-3P0 and R2-D2 such a great dynamic? They're both robots and one is essentially a talking fax machine, either way, best robot chemistry ever.
But If I'm going to really talk about one Star Wars characters it's Han Solo as played by the greatest of all time, Harrison Ford. Simply put Han Solo is my favourite movie character of all time; the cinematic embodiment of masculinity and individuality. He's badass, cocky, funny, has a legendary vest, is the most handsome man ever and every word of dialogue he utters I would frame and hang on my wall. Yes, he is God himself.The other thing I love about Star Wars which like many things was sorely missed in the prequels is the entourage of British actors. To me Star Wars isn't Star Wars without an imperial star destroyer on which every commander on board has a sinister English accent. Even the presence of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin I feel elevates Episode IV over other films in the saga.The confrontation between Obi-wan and Darth Vader still remains my lightsaber duel in the series. Two old men, minimal movement, no music, choreography as basic as it gets, yet it is infinitely more emotional and substantial than Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen doing somersaults inside a volcano for five hours.Star Wars changed cinema, pop culture and the world as we know it for a reason. Something which has brought joy and happiness to myself and millions around the world (as well as much anger and despair). Many film snobs will dismiss Star Wars as the film which ruined cinema helping bring about the end of the New Hollywood era which it total tosh. I could go on and on and on with this review, adding more to it like Lucas likes to add changes to his already existing films but I feel the best way to review what Is one of the most talked-about films of all time I too try and convey the sense of emotion and euphoria I get from watching such a film.",10,2,5,4 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back, With a Vengeance!
","The Empire Strikes Back is my least favourite of the original trilogy, I guess I just prefer the more light-hearted nature of A New Hope and Return of the Jedi (plus when has darkness become a measure of quality?), as well as the sense of closure given by those films but calling it my least favourite is like saying this pizza with 19 slices of pepperoni is it not as good as this pizza with 20 slices of pepperoni. It's appropriate that the second part of the three-act story is the dark entry so the more light-hearted third act can act as a release from the darkness and despair.Imagine if Star Wars went in the direction of The Planet of the Apes franchise? It's a miracle the studio had no input into the film, creating the movie sequel all movie sequels aspire to be. What if it was a rushed out sequel titled Star Wars II? If Jaws started the trend of blockbusters and Star Wars cemented it, then The Empire Strikes Back was the final step in the birth of the blockbusters, by cementing the rules behind the art of the movie sequel (and creating the subtitle any movie sequel wishes they had). However, could the film's quality also due to Lucas not having any input into the writing or directing of the film?The Empire Strikes Back is a film of more advanced directorial prowess than A New Hope in this ridiculously fast-paced movie. Right from the start, you can tell the characters within The Empire Strikes Back are much deeper than the first film. Han and Leia are simply one of the greatest romances in all of cinema; the classic tale of two who pretend to hate each other but are secretly in love, a trope as old as cinema. Watch as the two engage in the hottest moments of a generally a-sexual franchise. It's no surprise the two are posed in the manner of Rhett Butler and Scarlet O'Hara on the film's poster. Yet The Empire Strikes Back introduces the closest thing to rivaling the coolness of Han Solo in the form of Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee Williams, to inject some smooth blaxploitation vibes into the Star Wars universe (not to mention the beauty of the Cloud City theme).The planets in Star Wars are like characters themselves from the tundra of Hoth providing a counter to the deserts of Tatooine, to the intimacy and poignancy to the scenes on the swamp planet Dagobah and its one (as far as we know) lowly inhabitant. Yoda really is a perfect creation, like Obi-Wan, you do wonder if everything he says is full of nonsense when you break it down but it doesn't matter. It's just a shame the perception of the character has become bastardized because of the prequels. Plus what is it about stop-motion that is just endlessly appealing to look at from the long shots of the Tauntauns to those majestic herds of impending was elephants known of AT-ATs during the Battle of Hoth. The manner in which the stop motion doesn't have the full fluid motion of live action movement but not to the point that it looks choppy is a visual I never tire off.Although the darkest, The Empire Strikes Back is the funniest film of the series. C-3PO constantly telling people about the improbability of escaping the situation they're getting themselves into, to Han's many sarcastic whips never fails to get a laugh. Plus the movie keeps teasing you that you're going to get to see that iconic jump to light speed shot from the first film, making it all the more satisfying when you finally do get to see it.Even Darth Vader is significantly deepened as a character in The Empire Strikes back, thanks in part to him getting his own theme music to strike the fear of impending authoritarianism into your heart, but also thanks to certain plot twist.'I am your Father', the most well-known piece of pop culture knowledge. Is there anyone in the civilised world who doesn't know Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father? Should we try and preserve the secrecy of these plot twists so future generations can enjoy the surprise?",10,1,2,4 May 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Now That's What I Call Archaeology!
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes everything that made Raiders of the Lost Ark great to begin with and builds on top of that. Last Crusade is unquestionably my favourite of the series and the main reason for this being the role of Sean Connery as Indy's father Henry Jones Sr, which I consider to be one of the greatest casting choices ever made. This casting was largely due to James Bond being one of the inspirations for Indiana Jones although oddly enough despite my love of Indiana Jones I've never been keen on the James Bond films. There's something about father-son stories that I've always had a particular affection for and the relationship between Indy and his father is challenging to put into words how thematically in-depth it is. The search for the bond between father and son ends up becoming more important than the search for the grailTheir personalities differ from Henry being more of an academic and Indy being more of an adventurer (at the film's beginning Indy is struggling to even find the time to grade his student's papers), yet at heart, they are both giddy schoolboys. Their emotionally distant relationship is beautifully conveyed during their exchange on the airship in which Indy complains to his father about never being there for him. His father replies by asking him what does he want to talk about and Indy struggles to find a conversation point to dwell on. The tone of Henry's response, 'well what are you complaining about?!' sums it up beautifully. At the film's climax when Henry finally calls his son Indiana rather than Junior, it gives me chills alongside his words of 'Let it go' as legitimate advice I apply to many real-life situations (when has a James Bond movie had anything as remotely substantive as this?).Their scenes together are so melancholic and full of complex emotions that further humanises the character of Indiana Jones. I really do think this may be the greatest pairing of two actors ever and when I contemplate on it. I also feel this is the best performance Harrison Ford ever gave in his career, never has he been able to convey such emotion on-screen (and impersonate and art-loving Scotsman). Ford is one of few actors who can make any normal line of dialogue into something memorable.The Last Crusade is also a comedy classic in its own right from the North by Northwest type moments ('No ticket!') to more slapstick-oriented gags. The Hitchcock influence even extends to borrowing a moment from The Lady Vanishes in which young Indy escapes from a train via a magician's box. Likewise, the Forest Gump type moment in which Indy inadvertently confronts Hitler face to face is brilliant on so many levels. - It works the same way the clothes hanger scene from Raiders did.The supporting cast of players in the Last Crusade are second to none. Indy, Henry, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) are simply so much fun to watch together on screen, with the clumsy Marcus going on the adventure (whereas in Raiders he is only seen at the beginning and end of the film) also really gives Last Crusade a big boost. Even his line 'The pen is mightier than the sword' always cracks me up with the manner in which he delivers it in an English gentlemanly way, or Indy Sr's uttering of 'Junior!'; music to my ears. Likewise, I'm more than happy to listen to the eloquent and well-spoken Julian Glover as Walter Donavon as himself and Harrison Ford deliver exposition and tell each other 'bedtime stories' (and subsequently transform into Doc Brown just before his untimely demise). Ernest Vogel (Michael Byrne) on the other hand is a completely two-dimensional villain in the best way possible with his intimidating presence as one really evil, tall, uniformed Nazi with a powerful music cue to introduce him in any scene. He has also has one of the most comical deaths in any film ever in a bizarrely campy two-second shot on him falling towards the camera. - Even the actor playing the Grail Knight (Robert Eddison) is mesmerizing in his brief part.If I was the make a list of my favourite action scenes in film, I swear my list would be dominated by scenes from the original Star Wars trilogy and its sister franchise. Sequences such as that on the circus train or in the belly the steel beast make such clever use of props and their surroundings. Last Crusade was one of the last blockbusters to have such extensive use of practical effects, you know, before CGI had to go and ruin everything. Two years later Terminator 2 was released and things would never be the same again. As for the film's music, the score by John Williams is not only one of his best but one of his most moving, perfectly capturing the melancholic and deep thematic nature of the film. I regularly listen to the movie's soundtrack in moments of personal reflection, it's that powerful.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of those rare films which gives me everything I could ask for in a motion picture. Like the filmmakers specifically made it just for me, encapsulating everything I love about cinema. The final shot of the four characters riding off into the sunset brings to an end to a decade of filmmaking like no other.",10,3,5,13 June 2015
Back to the Future," Spaceman From Pluto
","An aura of 'cool' permeates everything about Back to the Future. I could imagine seeing this film when it came out in 1985 (of course I wasn't alive) and watching Marty McFly riding through Hill Valley on his skateboard while holding onto the back of a truck to The Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News and thinking to myself, 'omg, this is just the coolest film ever'. To me Marty McFly is the personification of cool, he rides skateboards, has a hot girlfriend, plays guitar. Yet his life is far from perfect; his dad is a dweb, his mum is an alcoholic and his uncle is in prison. This brings him down to a relatable level, plus he hangs out with a crazy old scientist. Why? I don't want to know. I like the mystery of not knowing how this unconventional friendship came to be. The technical jargon between Marty and Doc is a never-ending pleasure to listen and even lines which shouldn't be memorable are somehow highly quotable ('Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that it's 8:25...dam I'm late for school!'). Likewise taking the coolest looking, commercially available car and making that the time machine is yet another stroke of genius. Notice the scene in which we see the DeLorean for the first time; it's impossible for Doc Brown to get inside the DeLorean while it is inside the truck so he would have had to get into the car and drive it into the truck and just wait there until Marty would show up and then drive it out and exit the car. I guess Doc thought he had made a time machine that looked so badass he really had to give it an impressive introduction to Marty. The whole movie has the best uses of product placements I've seen in a film; never before have I been happier to see advertisements for Pepsi and Texaco. The pacing of Back to the Future is perfect, the film never lets up; the odds keep stacking up against Marty and the suspense towards the end of the film is crazy.Even though most of the film takes place in the 1950's, Back To The Future is the film which defines the 1980's. The ending in which Marty finds his family has been changed for the better and he gets the 4x4 vehicle he wanted; it's a wish fulfilment fantasy and very much a capitalist, 80's ideal. It's an uplifting ending, providing you ignore the fact that Marty now has to adjust to living with a family he has no previous memory off. It makes sense that Marty goes back to the year 1955, the time period of when adolescence had a voice and began an economic force for the first time in history; plus just take a look at the title of what won Best Picture that year. Marty's mother being attracted to her son is weirdly funny plus his mother being the opposite of her adult herself; makes you question your own parents claims about their day. I'm always struck by the moment when Marty tell his relatives in 1955 he has two TVs and they think he's joking yet if you told someone in 1985 that households today own upwards of 6-7 TVs, they would have the same reaction.Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back To The Future; to me these are the trilogy of trilogies. The three film sagas I can watch again and again, always notice something new on each viewing, discussing every character to no end, coming up with crazy fan theories and trying to find an explanation to any possible plot hole. I'm sure there are still plenty of subtle gags, use of foreshadowing and who knows what lurked within this film which I still haven't noticed. Is it possible for a film to be 100% perfect, one which has absolutely nothing wrong with it no matter how minuscule? I can't think of another film (or series) which has a better use of repeating images and motifs. If I could only bring one DVD to a desert island, it would be my trilogy box set so I could spend my time uncovering every last secret in the trilogy.
