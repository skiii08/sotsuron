The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie Till date??No ways
","One of the most anticipated movies is here and the name is avengers,the movie was good overall with good caste and excellent VFX.the USP of the film was that the effects are really good and humor is excellent,watching the super heroes battle it out with each other and the evil is even better .A lot of humor and mix of action ideally makes this movie a summer blockbuster for sure.The editing is excellent and the character building is fantastic ,The director has tried to give each superhero it's due except the thor which seems to have a sort of subdued entry in the movie :(.Anyways,it is fun surely the 3D is better than most of the crap which comes out calling it 3d,so do watch it 3d.Now Why the hell did I give it 7 and not 10/10? the reason is that: was slow in the first half,yea they wanted to build the story alright but it was kinda slow for me,I was expecting a lot more action in the first half which was absent apart from 2 fights which I won't spoil it for you guys.Second half was much better but I felt the action was limited,the superhero fights were mishmash-ed.They were certainly not enough.I wanted more superhero fights,more drama,more action.it just didn't happen.The ending was not very great either,We have Seen these sorta endings many times.We want something new,specially being avengers,common guys..So for me Avengers is above average movie/Good Movie but certainly not the best.7/10!",7,2,12,30 April 2012
The Orphanage," My first review and i felt like writing it!!
","Well,i watched this movie first reading on IMDb as to what a masterpiece it it.and i must say Am not Disappointed at all but inundated by the amount of effort put in to make such a classy piece of cinematic experience.The movie talks about woman coming back to the orphanage where she has stayed,to recreate an environment for needy kids.her son is affected by a terrible disease,his son keeps telling about the invisible friends of his??but who are they??what do they want???you must watch the movie for that??don't wanna spoil it for you!!though it would seem the movie is inspired from greats like poltergeist etc.but there is something different which leave you in awe.Take my word you must watch this won't be disappointed at all for people who like atmospheric horror rather than the gory kinds!",9,1,2,13 May 2009

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Enjoyable In parts But I expected More
","Personally speaking I went in with a lot of expectations with the movie,I was so excited that I literally dragged myself to the cinema hall on a weekday taking a sick leave from office,but I was left longing for much much more,not that the film was bad,it is good but it just is not that good when compared to it's predecessors.the good: great visuals and cinematography,nice photography,the hour in the movie was good and used sparingly,it is not overused but the humor is a bit kiddish..maybe because the book is for the children and hence the humor is put forward in that manner but i enjoyed it.Fight scenes between the goblins and bilbo,the fight scenes of the orks are good too,the ending with the eagles and the fight of the ork leader with Thorin was one of the few scenes in recent times made me move.To see it come back to middle earth in itself felt great to me,i am sure to all those LOTR fans who felt this movie should have been made a lot before will be not disappointed because it makes you feel nostalgic.the movie is a good watch for family,specially children as well..you can go with your family and watch it.scenes of golum and bilbo were highlight of the movie..its just rollicking The BAD: the movie till about 45-50 min of it's running time is slow and sluggish,they could have fasten it up a little.At time i felt ,please fasten it a little.i could not wait for them to start off their journey but they continued to introduce one dwarf at a time which bored the hell out of me.the movie is in 48fps 3D which was totally unnecessary.In fact I hated the 3d.it was dull and obnoxious.Many scenes were without 3d and I had to remove my 3d glasses to actually see.the 48fps gave me the headache.it is advisable that you watch the movie in 2d,i am sure you would like it more.There are few things like gandalf meeting elrond,sarumon which did not make sense,i have not read the books but they need not bring witch king's sword in between of all this,they could have made the movie 30 min shorter if they did not add these small little things.I did not find any point in adding these characters.The direction is good but it is not as tight as LOTR,maybe peter jackon outshined himself in LOTR and its such a true masterpiece that you can't help but compare it to it and that's where it falls short.If you are to compare this with fellowship of the rings..i remember fellowship being slower compared to the other two..so am putting my bets on desolation of smaug,that will be faster with much more action..watch it as independent movie,you will like it,not a masterpiece but better than most crap dished these days7/10",7,5,14,18 December 2012
The Evil Dead," Even after so many years it terrorizes you like never before!
","I have given it 9 and ..Lemme tell you guys am young my brother got this movie on rentals VCR'when i was a kid.i dare say..looking at the cover of the movie cassette gave me goosebumps..and still does some of the scenes.this is classic horror movie where couple of guys go on a camping trip you know the guy and the girl thing..int he woods..i feel this is a father of all the teen horror flicks..it's like they invented this so i give this movie thumbs up for the novelty.Secondly,the atmosphere it creates make you feel you are there in that house,with those guys.You feel for ash the main guy in lead man why its happening to him.Special effects for those times are great but i always felt they could remake this movie with new effects like you can feel the witch is made up,but never the less the voices are superb,sound effects gosh..don't watch t late night i tell you.Though I would say,many movies have come and gone but evil dead is standing like a pillar.cos of its original concept.Go watch this rent it buy it..and am sure you will be here to write a review of your own.",9,1,2,13 May 2009
Saw," saw is a good movie with good twists
","well I didn't know what to expect from this movie to start with,but as the movie progressed slowly but surely it got me involved in it like a good thriller should the acting is fine cant remember any particular exceptional performance, but the story and direction were very powerful.there were huge amount of twists not that much violence but i think it would leave you thinking for the rest of the night as to are people actually ungrateful to live!!!!!! gr8 movie and I would advise it to every thriller movie fan.....10/10 by me",10,0,1,21 February 2006
3 Idiots," Good Attempt with meaningful cinema
","I visited a multiplex nearby reading highly rated reviews and i can assure you I wasn't disappointed,you wouldn't be either. Lemme tell you why:-1)Aamir Khan's performance in itself is the highlight of the movie,nobody can carry off such a bubbly,upbeat yet so since student as amir khan portrayed,so if you really wanna admire one good piece of acting then you souldn't miss Aamir Khans role in 3 idiots.2)Laughter,more laughter and more laughter..there were barely scenes where you couldn't laugh and for the rest of the movie,or for the most of the part i had a big smile on my face cos it is that kind of light movie which never relies on sick jokes but natural comedy.3)The acting of the Professor aka Virus or Boman Irani in real..well that has to be for me a performance of a lifetime,this man has surpassed himself and many stalwarts of acting by portraying a hyper professor who wants to win at any cost.4)Beautiful songs,if your a music.bug no matter if you cant understand Hindi,even the instrumentals don't fail to touch your heart.but there are some minor cons with movie specially in the second half,the pregnancy scene of Kreena's sister has been too stretcched and the movie just did'not let the audience guessing..coming to the end..i had already figured out whats going to happen?cons are pretty minor.so if you have not seen this movie you must book a ticket now...or surely must a rent a DVD.after watching the movie you would surely say ALL IZZ well!",10,1,4,3 February 2010
