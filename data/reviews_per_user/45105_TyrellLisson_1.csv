The Monuments Men," Good Story, Failed Execution
","The Monuments Men happens to be one of those films that fall into the vast category of films that could of been great with the interesting story, but since the execution of the film didn't do it justice, it just become mediocre. The plot is scattered and uninspiring and it is an obvious 'American Feel-Good' film. These two things might seem minimal to some, but it is the major reason this movie failed. The story could of been the most important and diverse part of this film. It was, however, just rushed and boring. Clooney's narration is just as bad, as he rambles about art being important because it is art? What is that nonsense. The film being saturated with pumping up America's ego is just was the tip of the iceberg. Rather than focusing on the historical value of the art in various parts of Europe and their significance to society, etc. it focused on American's saving the day again! Unfortunately this movie flopped, the potential was oozing and yet we got a complication of nonsense.",5,5,7,17 February 2014
