Requiem for a Dream," It will break your heart....
","Wow. This movie totally blew me away. I have to say it has been one of the most brutal, shocking yet refreshing films I have ever viewed. The film partly revolves around the life of Sara Goldfarb, a TV junkie who loves chocolate, who lives alone in her apartment. We witness various events in her life, such as how her son Harry steals her television set from her to pawn it for drug money, how much she loves her T.V. shows (JUICE) and her sugary junk foods, and how she really is a vulnerable, depressed and lonely woman. After winning an opportunity to appear on a television show, she posts her application form and then chooses a stunning red dress which she wore to Harry's graduation as the outfit which she will wear on television. Being a little overweight, the dress does not quite fit, so, determined to be able to wear the dress in time for her T.V. appearance, Sara decides to go on a diet. An eggs and grapefruit diet. The experience is gruelling for her, and we see how over the weeks she struggles over the temptation to indulge in doughnuts and chocolates. However when Sara's refrigerator starts jumping around and scaring her to death, she decides to do something. She decides to go to a doctor and start taking diet pills. Four pills which will be her meals for the day. Taking them seems not so bad at first. But what we discover over the days and weeks is that these pills are bad drugs. Drugs that are slowly ruining her life. It starts to come to the point of terrifying, when her fridge becomes alive and even more crazy as she starts to hallucinate. So she goes to the doctor. But the doctor doesn't seem to be interested in these weird events in the slightest, and instructs her to continue taking them. Still waiting for a reply from the T.V. studio, Sara takes the train to the studio. This scene really captures how these pills have affected her. She has changed from a moderately happy woman with good health to an unhappy, unhealthy, untidy, unstable, lonely and depressed lady, who only wants to star on television. After the studio calls the hospital, Sara is taken into care and is forced to eat some proper food in order for her to regain health and proper weight. In the end the doctors decide to treat her with ETC. At the very end of the film we can see how much Sara has been affected. The story of Sara Goldafrb is an unsettling and heartbreaking one ... the simple idea of how these pills ... these drugs have made this poor, vulnerable old woman's life spiral downward, making her a shaky, nervous lady, obsessed with her T.V. appearance. I was so sad by the end, crying to myself as my sympathy and sorrow for the character poured out of my heart, as I realised how devastating and upsetting her life turned out, after all of the terrible events. I was amazed by the absolutely stunning performance by Ellen Burstyn. It was truly dazzling and totally believable. I was affected greatly by the acting and the character in both a good and bad way. The film revolves around Sara Goldfarb's son, best friend and girlfriend too - Harry, Tyrone and Marion - three characters who deal and do drugs. The film follows them, and what they do in order to get drugs - for example, taking a trip to the supermarket. Marion, Harry's girlfriend (played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) is a drug addict who sleeps with a couple of men to get money, but whose talent is sketching. When Harry decides to save up enough cash in order to buy a place so Marion can set up a store, it seems nothing will go wrong. But after Tyrone gets put in jail, Harry uses all the saved money to bail him out. When failing to find any drugs to buy, Harry and Tyrone go to California - or was that Florida (!) in order to buy. In the meanwhile we also see how Marion has degraded herself to stripping in front of crowds of men, using a dildo with another woman. It concludes with Harry being taken to hospital, after we see how injecting drugs has turned Harry's arm into a horrible sight... Tyrone is taken to jail and Marion loses all dignity. We witness the various drug-related outcomes in their lives. Marlon Wayans, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly ALL play amazingly well roles, with excellent, convincing performances. The stylish use of the split-screen technique, huge close-ups and exaggerated sound effects add to the glossiness and the soundtrack is haunting and unforgettable. I highly recommend this daring, brutal shock-fest for all of those with a strong stomach in search of a powerful and unnerving trip into the narcotics dependent darkness of modern America. A must-see ... cinematic history...",10,1,2,28 July 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Hits the Sweet Tooth.
","I just got back to the first viewing of this at my local cinema, and I was blown away by this sickly-sweet treat! I was so eager to see this, as I love the Gene Wilder original, however after watching the remake I fell in love with it even more than I had fell in love with the original. It certainly stayed more faithful to the book than the original did, for example this film keeps the squirrel scene, where Veruca is proved to be a bad nut, and is then thrown down the garbage chute, and there are also extra scenes which we never see in the original, such as Oompa-Loopma-Land, however it added a dark and eerie story about Willy Wonka's childhood, which was certainly an interesting addition. I had to say in my opinion too, that I enjoyed the Oopma-Loompa songs in this remake far more than I enjoyed the ones from the original, and the fact that only one actor played every single Oompa-Loompa was a good chuckle too. I thought Freddie Highmore and Johnny Depp stole every scene with their quality acting, and Depp was excellent, as a dark, twisted, witty Willy Wonka. The film is certainly more twisted than the 1971 version, but it is still eye-pleasingly colourful and fun, both for children and adults alike. I highly recommend this sweet trip to Willy Wonka's factory. Dare to venture into his wonders, and indulge in the sweet, sweet hilarity and madness. You won't be unsatisfied.",10,1,3,29 July 2005
The Descent," Claustrophobic Horror
","The Descent is a tense horror movie which will eat at you and play on your mind long after viewing. The Descent is one of the best horror movies to come around for a very long time. The plot follows six friends who reunite for a caving expedition after a tragic accident which effects the main character - Sarah's life, forever. This trip is in order to get back out into the real world and experience fun again and to help put Sarah's mind at ease. Their adventure soon goes terribly wrong when a collapsing of rocks traps them deep in the dark, claustrophobic underground caves, and they find themselves being chased by bloodthirsty Crawlers - deformed creatures who have inhabited these caves for hundreds of years. Character development doesn't go overly deep -- but it doesn't really need to. The headstrong girls all get along fine, but there are obvious alliances and unspoken grudges hanging in the air. It is a realistic group of people you can truly imagine in reality. Juno has organised this adventure, a climb down into a famed cave system. She is the leader of the group; assertive and intelligent. Her new friend Holly is a hardcore thrill junkie and looks like she could be trouble, while mild-mannered, supportive Beth, Rebecca who is soon to become a doctor and Sam fall more in line in terms of group dynamic. As the movie begins, and they start their climb through these narrow, dark, nerving tunnels the tension already begins to rise. You can almost feel the emotion, the fear and excitement these girls are feeling. You can almost smell the dank, earthy smell of these ancient tunnel-ways. The way the film sucks you into the situation; makes you sweat, gives you goosebumps, makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end - this is genuinely effective scares. The movie doesn't require the false scares and loud jumps that are overplayed nowadays; it just grabs you by the scruff of you neck, and throws you deep into the exhilarating experience of enclosed spaces, with this group of intelligent, skilled, athletic women, who continue on down these tunnels... until Juno makes a horrifying confession which dreads you with fear. This isn't the cave that she pointed out to them in the guidebook. It is in fact uncharted, and she has no clue if there is another exit from where they are at this point. Right about now you feel so nervous. The lump in your throat is growing bigger and your palms become sweaty. The terrifying idea that this situation rings true to what could very easily happen in real life is a horrifying idea. And the thought of being lost and with no sense of control or direction, thousands of feet underground where nobody can help makes the tension rise higher and higher. The group's bond is stretched by this horrible news. They, naturally, freak out and start to argue and point the blame finger. As these women then continue on with their journey deeper and deeper into the darkness, physical stress and strain begins to become apparent. They are sweaty and hot and wet and dirty. They have very little equipment and soon lose their rope. As they continue further and further into the heart of the underground, there is also that burning question swimming around them. Are they going to be able to find a way out, or are they just going further and further into the wrong direction? Paranoia, desperation, claustrophobia and pressure begins to make the girls crack. They begin to hear noise and echoes and crawling sounds. Could it be that they are not alone? Could there be other people down here who could help them? Apparently not, we learn, as we are introduced to Crawlers - bloodthirsty hunters - in a revealing way which will make you jump out of your skin and make it crawl. This introduction to the villain is one of the most heart-pounding ones I have ever seen! It really gets your adrenalin pumping! During the initial attack on the group, an attack is made on one of the girls and the group is split up. Now things really begin to get moving along at a jaw-dropping pace. These horribly deformed creature inhabit these caves and prey on humans. However they are blind, so they track down their prey with their astounding hearing skills. Once the group is split up in a wave of panic and frenzy, things really start to get juicy. Pits of bones, pools of blood, chambers filled with stalagmites and stalactites (which are cleverly filmed to show how dangerous and deadly they can be; like razor sharp poles. They almost seem to make you think how even the caves are against the group of girls, because of how extremely dangerous and unsafe they can be. Even the caves and tunnels are on the Crawlers side) and dark tunnels which go on forever are what the girls encounter, as they continue to delve deeper, in both fear and hope for survival and escape. As the film pushes itself to the extreme without stopping to take a breath, emotional secrets are revealed, fatal accidents are made, and a final act of vengeance leaves you sitting there with you jaw in your lap, your spine tingling and your head swimming with emotions on these events. The Descent is a fantastic race against time. Not only does it pile on the gory goods the tense unnerving chills, but it also breaks into tougher topics; betrayal, revenge, decisions, responsibility and fear for survival. Neil Marshal delivers a fantastic, brutal horror movie which doesn't play out the typical clichés and stereotypes. It is as real a story with an array of true, honest, believable characters and real questions, thoughts and touches on real emotion. The Descent it a definite must see, and one of the finest horror films to come around for years and years.",10,27,50,4 August 2006
