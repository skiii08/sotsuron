The Blair Witch Project," Kinda Blah
","This was a good movie, I gave it a 9, but at some parts it dragged way too much. Maybe I've just seen too many scary movies and they all seem predictable now. If you see the beginning of this one, then you dont need to see the end. Parts of it just seem to go together, and that makes it predictable. It was a good movie, I didnt think that it was very scary.. It was a blah scary movie, a good suspense movie though. Some one needed to rethink when the said it was horror.",1,0,2,31 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," the funniest construction paper i've ever seen
","this movie was hilarious. i feel kinda sorry for movies like 'the haunting' (the new one) and 'matrix' because they have all those special effects, and they still aren't as good as this.why can't more people be creative and animate construction paper? sheesh. ok first off if you are sexually illiterate or under the age of 14 (yes mom, we all know what THAT means by 14) DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. it was NOT intended for you. also dont go see it before you watch a south park episode.. you will run out of the theatre in disguist.still it is a rather funny movie and its such a shame that more people can't make movies this funny.",10,0,0,5 August 1999
