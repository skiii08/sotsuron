Blade Runner 2049," Not Aging Well
","I liked this the first time-around because it's mysterious, but you keep expecting a lot of action and fun and that never really happens. Watching it again a few years later it seems, ah hmm...perhaps a bit boring. It has some good moments,(I'm thinking of Elvis serenading Han Solo as he repeatedly punches Gosling harder than Pine punches Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness. I take that back. After watching it again its clear Kirk beats on Khan ten times harder in Star Trek Into Darkness, a movie that came out four years earlier. They should have got the same special effects team to oversee the beating) 2049 tends to stay in the key of Slit your wrist - this future world is void of trees and smiles, and even the hookers are trying to pull a fast one on you. The dreary minor music adds to the lonely ambience. All you have is your fake hologram girlfriend and existential questions. Ending seemed rushed and didn't really address Wallace or the issue of knocking off expired androids.",6,2,3,3 September 2019
Wind River," Murder mystery thriller set in the winter wilderness of Wyoming
","This is a pretty standard crime thriller, with Jeremy Renner playing the role of a Native American hunter/tracker helping out a newbie FBI agent in the remote winter wilderness of Wyoming. What makes it unique is perhaps the emotional grieving experienced by the families involved as well as having a main character who is a tracker. The acting here is very strong, perhaps less so by Elizabeth Olsen, but she is stuck in the unlikely role of a new FBI agent who seems to have been given the job without any credentials or knowledge of how to solve a crime. She depends almost entirely on Jeremy Renner, even showing up without a proper coat for the weather. Everything is wrapped up more or less as expected but I was hoping for an extra twist or two to make it interesting.",6,4,6,12 March 2018
Star Trek," This is why we go to the movies
","This is easily the best star trek movie yet and perhaps the most exciting and entertaining movie in the past ten years.Im not a 'trekkie' but am familiar enough with the originals on TV and this was somewhat important for appreciating the comic references and for appreciating the developing cast. Unlike the new Star Wars movies, this movie was mature enough to appeal to a broad range of ages, with a quick-witted script, great one-liners, as well as deep reflection on serious issues. The antagonists are not simply 'bad', as in lessor movies, but act out of a complicated history.The action is spectacular, original, and well-thought out. It is a fun ride from the beginning to the end, and even the quiet moments are filled with a forward momentum and underlying suspense. I think most people in the theater could have easily sat through another few hours. This is one that you owe it to yourself to see on the big screen... Did somebody say 'best picture'?",9,1,7,19 July 2009
Memento," Overrated
","I saw this movie around five years ago so you'll have to forgive me if you're a fan. The truth is I was not blown away by this 'diabolical thriller'. Sure it leaves you scratching your head but is that necessarily a good thing? It may be a 'super intelligent' movie but that does not necessarily make it good art. I remember the acting as being semi-wooden, the production values low, and the dialog sparse. Is it a confusing movie? Absolutely. Will it makexsense if you watch it a dozen times? Probably. But I still would not count this as one of the top 250 movies of all time. That said, my hat off to a truly original script",5,26,49,23 December 2008
The Expendables," Much Less Than I Expected, (and I didn't expect much)
","All the great action sequences in the world cannot save a movie that has no character. With all the veteran talent coming together I expected a lot more character, humour, and perhaps a bit of a developed story. I didn't get a lot of this. Instead I got the feel that a lot of the dialogue was improvised - which is the difference between stand-up comedy and comedy improv. I got the feeling that there was not a whole lot of chemistry amongst these guys that we are supposed to be cheering for. The great Bruce Willis was given a role that was so far beneath his abilities and talent that it left me feeling a bit confused as to how this script was written. They try for a little mock sentimentality in the character portrayed by Mickey Rourke but this doesn't really fly either within the 1-dimensional action storyline. The irony is that it is usually in the nature of these movies that anyone speaking English with an accent is a bad guy; well the worst butchering of the English language in this movie comes from the mumbling protagonists.",4,5,12,23 February 2011
Watchmen," Ultimately a boring and uneventful movie
","The first five minutes lays the foundation for an interesting plot which is not handled in any noticeable way for two hours. Things get increasingly frustrating with every flashback as the viewer is further educated on the history and motivations of all the characters. These techniques, which seem to make up more than half the movie stunt any forward momentum. The violence is over the top, unnecessarily gory. The music is some of the greatest music ever written: Dylan, Simon and Garfunkle, Leonard Cohen, etc. But it feels almost too mainstream, like it's '60's awareness time children, put down your Brittany Spears!'. Sure it's great but way too obvious. The fight scenes are typical Asian choreography, strings attached, nothing new here, the usual dancing. So, all in all, I was left feeling bored for most of the movie. There was some excellent and convincing acting in the Rorshack character, who is likable for his uncompromising views, his fearlessness, and his humour.",6,1,4,24 July 2009
District 9," Suspenseful satire on human behavior
","I went into this movie knowing nothing and expecting something different. In this respect, I was mostly disappointed. Although there was some really great satire, (many of the scenes bordered on Saturday Night Live sketches), the overall plot was cliché. Too many times have we seen this same general theme. The last hour The storyline jumped round so many times, like 'let's do this' and then 'well that didn't work, let's do this'. It just felt a bit too loosely woven, without giving the viewer any sense of what the ultimate goal was for the protagonists. My other critique concerns suspension of belief. I don't mind suspending my belief to a certain extent, I think that is a necessary component of enjoying sci-fi. But there were several things that, unless you suspend your disbelief to the point of becoming a goldfish, you will ultimately attribute to poor story-editing. I actually enjoyed a lot of the shaky cam work, and the characters, acting, casting, it was all Bang On. Obviously, the effects were great.In retrospect, it was the first half of this movie that made it great- it mockingly, lightheartedly, displayed the most disturbing parts of human character and conduct. It was black comedy brought out in the land of sci-fi,a well-balanced tongue in cheek satire of hygienic cruelty. Unfortunately, The last half was a video game.",7,3,6,21 August 2009
The Hurt Locker," Lack of story, unrealistic
","This is a movie without any story, just a compilation of scenes with the same characters. A lot of it doesn't make much realistic sense. There is no plot, no objective, and very little character development. While each individual scene is kind of stressful there is nothing that ties any of it together (except perhaps the same characters, who are not very interesting) Although there seems to be some knowledge of the aspects of war, the script is immature, unable to produce any compelling drama. If you watch the first ten minutes then you've seen the whole movie. At some points it seems like it comes close to developing a plot but nothing materializes and we are back at square one. There was some good camera work at times and some good direction, highlighting the silences in a hypnotic way. Overall this is a pass.",3,39,66,27 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Pretty good!
","I enjoyed it more the second time around, when I picked up little things that I must have blinked over the first time - like the broom - and some really great set pieces, like the At At Walkers suspended in the factory set ablaze, and seeing the people standing in Kylo Ren's hovering ship from a far away shot. Some of these incredible scenes last for only a second and it's easy to miss how much went into making this look so great. I would have gone a different direction for some things - it wasn't made clear that alot of the main protagonists were, at one point, on the same ship, just in different locations on that ship - so that was a bit confusing when it all came together. I wouldn't have given Laura Dern purple hair as though she just walked in from the set of the Hunger Games. Casting Finn and Rose together seemed like an attempt to force a multicultural agenda - their storyline was the weakest in the film, especially after Benicio del Toro gets involved - this whole chapter should have been rewritten. On the positive side, Adam Driver - an actor I don't particularly fancy - was incredible as Kylo Ren. Every line he delivered was perfect, and just from his eyes you could see the conflict within. Brilliant",7,4,18,1 July 2018
Jurassic World," Riddled with clichés, zero character development, and nonsensical plots, but what did you expect from a 'Summer Blockbuster'?
","It's always nice to see Vincent d'Onofrio, but even his high caliber acting skills can't save what amounts to a very nonsensical plot. He plays the military liaison with a vested interest in using velociraptors in the military - you know, to carry out missions in dangerous war zones. It's hard to say it with a straight face, so we're obviously dealing with talented actors. Usually angry dinosaurs alone are sufficient when it comes to creating suspense, but this would require some decent writing, and seemingly incapable of this task, the writers decided to create a genetic hybrid monster-type dinosaur to try and elicit some emotion (although he is not a great deal scarier than the original T. Rex). I found it really challenging to care about any of the people who are trying to avoid getting eaten - despite the expressions of panic on their faces - and the frantic calls to the nanny. Some of the expressions of brotherly love between the children was well done, and, in line with the concept of 'summer blockbuster' you certainly get your share of big bad beasties. There were also a couple of excellent comedic exchanges with the secondary characters working the control room.",6,3,9,11 June 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Sadly Does Not Meet Expectations
","The Hunger Games borrows a little from the myth of the Minotaur, a little from the short story The Lottery, a little from the Truman Show, a little from Schwartznegger's Running Man, a little from Lord of the Flies. The plot originated in the movie Battle Royale (you might say ripped-off) and the future-Gothic costuming is reminiscent of Dune. It's a wonderful Freudian mix if you can relate to it on an emotional level. Unfortunately you can't. The reason is because the kids play along. Instead of being vulgar and defiant for the camera, they enter the twisted battle on horse-drawn carriages, proud of their beautiful custom-made clothing, their designer taking a bow for the masses. Up against insurmountable odds -asked to do despicable things to both strangers and loved ones - you would expect them to be mooning the camera every chance they get - (which is 24/7) but that might make it a PG movie. So instead they deliver a few touching speeches and jump into the arena. Some of the effects are good, and there is some decent suspense, but these elements are spaced out among the slower moving backdrop.",5,30,66,24 November 2013
Cube," garbage
","This movie can be considered a predecessor to the 'Saw' and 'Final Destination' franchises. You don't have to be intelligent to write this stuff - it seems like you just have to come up with different gory scenarios. However, I give this movie credit for an interesting premise: people caught in a futuristic maze. Set design is very good. That's a good starting point. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all you get. I found the acting really bad, lots of unconvincing over-acting - making it difficult to sympathize with any of the characters. If you really like all those Final Destination movies and all those Saw movies, you'll probably get some of the same twisted joy out of this little gem. But if you need something more, you better look elsewhere.",1,1,7,27 December 2011
Pineapple Express," Childish, violent, and not very funny - (but I may have watched the extended version)
","I was hoping for something that would give me a few laughs but I just didn't get this one. It had all the right ingredients for an awesome 'doobie-movie' - Seth and Franco are funny just to look at, and the plot of a stoner witnessing a crime seems like a solid starting point. Unfortunately, the story suffers from a lot of unrefined dialog - conversations which are supposed to make you laugh but end up coming off as bizarre or immature. I was also disappointed with the use of violence/gore and the filmmakers intent to turn this into laughs. Isn't this the drug of peace and love brother? Violent fights (and bloody gunfights)- even if they are done in a quirky, slapstick way -just don't push my laugh button. 'Ha Ha, that was so funny how he got killed' *Minor disappointment: I kept waiting to hear Paper Planes by MIA (I heard it in the preview) but I never heard it in the movie.Caveat: I may have watched the extended version.",5,1,5,3 April 2011
Inside Llewyn Davis," Darker Slice of Life Tribute to Folk Music
","'Life is a journey', but if you see anything romantic in that statement, you are not Llewyn Davis. It almost appears like he is on the verge of loving his art, - but without this love he is going nowhere fast. He sings his heart out but is his heart really in it, or is he just trying to scrape a few nickels together; keep on keeping on until he achieves some version of success in the music world? But I wonder if the desperation portrayed in this movie is merely applying today's negative image of a penniless couch-surfer onto what was a more dynamic, and younger 1960's Greenwich - where musicians sleeping on couches might have been the norm - and might not have been such a bad time (especially if you factor in the marijuana which the movie completely overlooked). In any event, if you're not having fun doing it, maybe you're not in it for the right reasons. The script seemed designed to extract as much emotional punishment out of each scene as possible. Don't worry, this isn't the suffering of child-laborers in Africa. In the end we're supposed to care for an under-appreciated artist - amongst many - trying to make the world a better place, hopefully, like an artist should. Good to acknowledge that. History has lost masterpieces, no doubt. 'Without the flower the branch shall die'Strange situations and strange people materialize in fun Coen brothers fashion, and we have to draw out some important symbolism. Characters emerge but are left - like his past - not fully developed or explained. This one's got a little of the blues in it. You are better off rooting for the cat.",6,1,1,8 July 2014
The Martian," Couldn't believe I was yawning
","Maybe it was due to a previous night of drinking, or to the comfortable seats, but I found myself yawning and I'm pretty sure the movie was partly to blame. It laid a nice premise but ended up so convoluted, technical, and dull, you would think it was based on a true story - fiction is usually more interesting. You have some pretty big names trying to make it work (Jeff Daniels), but it just seemed like a struggle to keep things interesting by constantly coming up with a new problem. At least in 'Cast Away' they could focus in on the main character. Here there are many parties to follow: Matt Damon, the NASA people, the crew returning to earth, and - unbelievably - the Chinese. Everybody is trying to grab a little screen time and it's just a big confusing mess, compounded by the length of time involved. They try to go all Disney with the emotional manipulation, but it really doesn't stick. I would rather watch Gravity again over this.",6,4,70,1 October 2015
