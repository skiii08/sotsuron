Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Great Followup
","This movie got 'mixed' reviews from critics, who felt the movie wasn't all that great. Then again, the critics tend to like movies most people don't and vice versa.Anyway, Game of Shadows picks up where the first Sherlock Holmes left off. This time, the main adversary is Professor Moriarity, 'the Napoleon of Crime,' as Holmes calls him.I will say that the plot takes a little while to develop but once it does, it really takes off.---Spoilers--- I will say I was surprised that Irene Adler was killed off in the first ten minutes of the film. I had expected her to remain in the series, but her death was necessary to create a level of humanity in Holmes.I do wish they had done a better job at showcasing Moriarity's sinister mind. The one time they do is at the opera house. The rest of the time, you only really see the end result. I feel like they maybe could have done a little more with him, but I was still very pleased with how they brought one of the great super-villains to life.The ending was pretty good, I thought, I loved the dueling minds in the showdown with Moriarity, and with how for a good 10 minutes, the audience was left wondering if we had really seen the last of Holmes. The end...?",8,1,3,3 January 2012
Star Trek," Diehards probably enjoyed it more
","Up front, I am not a loyal fan of Star Trek. I've probably seen between 12-15 episodes combined from all the series. I have seen all the movies and enjoyed them.I felt this film was more about giving die-hard fans a chuckle than about reviving the series.I enjoyed the movie, don't get me wrong but I didn't think it was anything special.The plot just was kind of thin. The basic premise and this contains spoilers, is that an angry Romulan (Nero) is able to come back in time and wreaks havoc. He blames Spock for everything and we learn that Spock is back from the future as well. So we have two Spocks now, young and really old. Leonard Nimoy plays old Spock to give this series some sense of continuity from the old series.To me, the main plot was having young Spock and Kirk become friends and the whole planet destroying Romulan was just a backdrop to that. It would have been better if they had fleshed out the villains more.The acting was good, the special effects were outstanding and the there were some funny moments (more so if you are a big fan).I felt that the writers were simply looking to recreate the original series and had to invent ways to get all the characters back on one ship. Again, I think this was done to amuse the die-hard fans than to advance the plot.If you are a die-hard fan, you'll probably love this movie. If you are just a casual fan or have little experience with Star Trek then you'll enjoy this movie but won't consider it anything spectacular.",6,1,8,10 May 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Entertaining...but not perfect
","The thing I didn't like about the first film (by JJ Abrams) was that I felt like I was missing out on a lot of jokes because all the Trekkies in the theater were laughing at various points of the movie that didn't seem funny at all to me. I'm not a Trekkie; I've seen the older movies and a few TV episodes, so I felt like I was witnessing a bunch of inside jokes, which seemed to be much of the first film.This time around was much better. Abrams is done introducing his version of the new universe and gets down to storytelling, albeit not as effectively as he could have done.From the original films, my favorite was Star Trek II. I loved Khan as a villain and I loved the sacrifice of Spock and I loved the space battles between the Enterprise and Reliant. So I was looking forward to this film.I wasn't sure how Khan would do, played by a scrawny British guy, but Benedict does a fine job playing a more brains vs brawn Khan. The problem with the film comes when you think about the plot too much... From the bombing in London onward, everything seems to happen simply as a plot device and without any real rationale behind it. I'm willing to believe that Khan couldn't get into the secret labs and had to coerce someone else to go in there and blow it up. But why would he personally attack the meeting and risk being killed or captured? Wouldn't history's smartest psychopath find a way to eliminate all those individuals in a more efficient way other than in a hovercar with laser cannons? Why would he teleport to the Klingon homeworld? Wouldn't he want to continue his war against Admiral Marcus...who was on earth? Again, this seemed like just a plot device so they could introduce the 72 special torpedoes and then the USS Vengeance. I was hoping for a good space battle, but you'll notice that the Enterprise fires exactly ZERO phasers or torpedoes in this film. It just gets rocked by the Vengeance. It would have been more satisfying to see the two ships duke it out.Anyway, plot holes and blatant plot devices aside, the film is good and does manage to make you care about the main characters and you do enjoy watching Khan really dominate his adversaries.I just wish Abrams was a better storeteller. So much of this film depended on convenient plot devices that really aren't explained. For instance...Marcus could have had Khan doing covert operations on the Klingon homeworld or something, which would explain why he went there. You get the idea.I also wish he would use regular filming techniques over the lens flare and the zoom-in blur effect...if I wanted to watch a home movie...I'd do just that.This is a film worth seeing and paying money for.",7,6,10,21 August 2013
Blade II," Best of the Blade films
","Yes I know, that's saying a lot (or not much) but it's true. The first Blade, to me, is comprised mostly of introducing the audience to Blade and explaining this version of the Vampire. These vampires are not affected by religious icons unlike Vampires in other works of fiction, just as an example. I also thought Stephen Dorff didn't pull off the arch-villain too well. He always comes off as a bit snotty and I just couldn't accept him as this mastermind to bring about a Vampire god. Maybe I'm being too critical, who knows.In Blade 3, the villains across the board seemed like amateurs compared to what he faced in previous films. Even Stephen Dorff was more believable than Parky Posey or the rest of that bunch. Dominic Purcell as Dracula or Drake....nah, not buying it. Hey, I like him in Prison Break but as the original vampire, I think they could have found someone with a little more depth. Hey, the guy who played Dracula in Van Helsing pulled it off perfectly. Also, there was just too much comic relief from Ryan Reynolds whom I could not buy as a vampire hunter. Every line from him was a joke, it seemed. Plus, they killed Whistler...again. Kris Kristofferson(sp) had little more than a cameo in this film simply so they could bring in eye candy with Jessica Biehl (sp). She did alright but it wasn't anything special.Now, take Blade 2. The villains were believable. The acting was good for the most part and the plot was interesting and deep enough. Basically, after Blade tracks down Whistler who has become a vampire himself, he is recruited by the Vampires to help fight a new common enemy, the reapers. The reapers are a mutation of the vampire virus that creates a creature more powerful than the vampire and harder to kill. Blade agrees to team up with the Vampires to hunt these creatures until it turns out that the head vampire has set this all up to create the next step in the vampire evolution. That's a pretty brief synopsis.What makes this Blade film different is that there is actual character development for Blade. He develops, if nothing else, a respect for vampires and even a possible love interest with a Vampire woman. This was starkly different compared to the other films where Blade is just a constant brooding individual who never changes.The special effects are great; no more of that obvious computerized blood that made Blade 1 almost silly at times. The fight scenes are great and come on...any film that has Ron Pearlman in it is going to be good.Blade 2 just had a different feel to it.",8,0,1,4 March 2008
Underworld Awakening," This series is getting stale
","Okay, each of the previous 3 films was at least different. The first established the world this franchise exists in. We met important characters and got the basics. The second filled in the rest of the story and we got an end to reign of the elders and the advancement of Selene into a new type of vampire. The third told us the story of Lucian and how the war came to be.This film does little except to squeeze out some cash from this series.Spoilers:Yes we see Selene and Michael's daughter, and her ability are cool, but this is still just vampires vs lychans. The film bills itself as a war between vampires and humans but its not. Plus, you know its bad when they clearly leave it open for another sequel. This is turning into the Resident Evil series, where the story never really ends and there is no real development...just decent fight scenes and little more.",5,2,4,11 March 2012
Now You See Me," I Wanted to Like This More
","Now You See Me is a fun movie that keeps you interested until the end. The cast is superb and the acting is great. The premise is an interesting one, but the big twist at the end really ruined the movie for me.Spoilers:It's obvious from the first scenes that there is a mystery man behind everything in the movie. You, the viewer, are left to guess who that is. They really push you into believing it is the female Interpol agent, but that really was too obvious. You might also think it was Morgan Freeman, but it's Mark Ruffalo, who is the head of the investigation into the heists.There were many coincidences and perfectly-timed events that had to happen for the movie to play out like it did. For one, before Ruffalo's character set all these things in motion, how would he know he would be the lead for the investigation? During the whole movie, his character does things that are inexplicable if he was really the master magician behind everything.Yes, you can explain away his persistence in trying to catch the 4 Horsemen in that he wanted to test them, but other actions don't make sense, like getting drunk at a bar after a failure to catch the thieves, or browbeating the female Interpol agent because he 'believes' she's in cahoots with the 4 Horsemen. This twist just seemed too forced. Like the writers really wanted to surprise you, so they make it impossible to ever suspect Ruffalo's character. The result is that you feel cheated. This isn't an ego thing, I enjoy a good twist, but it has to be reasonable, and it just wasn't here.At other times, you really have to suspend your disbelief for the movie to work. Franco's character happens to escape a certain way just when an FBI unmarked car pulls up. He later escapes by having an identical car set up on the Brooklyn Bridge. In order for this to work, they would have had to know the exact make and model (and color) of the FBI car that would be pulling up at the complete other end of the building. I hate to feel like I'm overthinking the writers, but I think they overthought the movie. Keep it simple and this movie would have been a lot better.",6,0,1,25 August 2015
Saw III," Not as good as the first 2
","When you watch the first two Saw films, you are actually surprised by the big twist at the end of the film. In this film, it's more a 'hmm' moment and then you begin to pick apart the ending as it is the not as well-thought through as the previous films.With the previous two films, I empathized with the characters caught in the games. Not so much in this one. I became annoyed with the guy because he was so slow to act and he moved around like he wasn't in any hurry. Maybe that was the intent; to make you want him to get what happens to him in the end. Even the doctor wasn't someone I felt any empathy for and as I said, the big twist really didn't shock me, at least not like the twists from the first two films.Now, there are some good points to Saw 3, such as revisiting the setups to the games played in the first Saw. I was surprised to learn that Amanda had been with Jigsaw for those. And it was interesting to see what happened to Eric from Saw 2. This Saw also has some of the most gross scenes of the whole trilogy...Jigsaw's surgery and the judge nearly drowning in pig guts top them all.Saw 3 is worth your time if you've seen the first two films and liked them. This one definitely has some of the sickest scenes as I already said and you'll appreciate seeing a little 'behind the scenes' of Jigsaw's earlier games. You won't remember this as one of the greatest horror films though...it's not up to the standard of the first 2 Saws.",6,1,2,1 April 2007
Batman Begins," Great Direction for the nearly dead franchise
","After the last two Batman movies which were just silly, this is a much welcomed addition. Gone are the cartoonish characters. Gone are the artsy flashy colors. Gone are the empty plots...This film has an actual storyline to instead of Batman just trying to catch some random arch-villain. It shows how Batman came into being; Bruce Wayne in China is brought into an ancient society of men devoted to fighting criminals which was a good way of explaining it. Yes the comic books have done that but in regards to the films it hadn't been done yet.The cast was very good...Christian Bale did a great job as Bruce Wayne. Liam Nieson has pretty much been typecast into the tragic father/mentor role for action films but he does it well. Tom Wilkinson, Katie Holmes, Cilian Murphy, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer all do a great job...even Ken Watanabe does great in his small role.It was very fun to watch Batman come alive on screen...the trial and error that Bruce Wayne goes through in creating Batman, the acquisition of his gear and the amazing Tumbler as the first Batmobile. And of course seeing a younger Gordon who does more than point and say 'Batman' like he did in the previous films and a more active Alfred.The reason this is a great film is because unlike the previous Batman movies, this one does not rely solely on the Batsuit or the action scenes to sustain it. The action is great, don't get me wrong but there's more to this film than Batman running around beating up thugs.",9,0,1,27 March 2007
Insidious," Breath of Fresh Air for the Hollywood Horror Industry
","This is a fun horror film to watch, mostly because its not the same crap that gets pawned off as horror these days. When we've had more than a half-dozen Saw movies (and I am aware that the same people made this movie), and other such flops, its nice to have a horror movie that doesn't rely on blood and gore.Even though it was very clear to the audience that the house itself wasn't haunted, I liked that fresh approach. The entities were all creepy, but they also weren't required to have all that much on screen time to do their work. The visit to the Further region was cool; weird but also spooky.The acting was sub-par at some points, but it wasn't too bad. The special effects were pretty good.My only complaint is that the movie was sometimes too dark that it was hard to see what was going on. This could have been the provider (Fear.net)hadn't optimized the film for presentation, but there were points where I figured it was supposed to be scary, but I had no clue what was going on.Anyway, I enjoyed this film. Hopefully it and others like it (such as the Conjuring) are a sign of things to come from the movie industry for the horror genre. There are predictions that the era of the blockbuster is coming to an end. Maybe that will mean Hollywood will focus on making good movies instead of expensive movies.",7,0,1,20 September 2013
The Dark Knight," Almost Perfect
","I have always been a fan of Batman. Though I never really read many of the comics I liked the fact that Batman was not supernatural; he was just a man; the danger is real to him. With other superheros like Superman or Spiderman; they can endure a lot of punishment because they have superpowers but Batman is just like us, he's just decided to do something about the injustice of the world.With that in mind, I was blown away by 'Batman Begins' because it wasn't just another Batman sequel; it completely reinvented the hero. Whats more, the movie was good and aside from the obvious aspects, it could have passed for a regular action movie instead of a superhero movie. So I greatly anticipated the next film.'The Dark Knight' did not disappoint. The storyline was complex and captivating. The special effects were great and better yet, they weren't all CGI. The acting was superb.Christian Bale, in my opinion is the best Batman and he continues to portray a Bruce Wayne/Batman who is still conflicted about his role in society.Heath Ledger gave perhaps his best performance as The Joker and I say that as a skeptic when I first heard he was going to be playing The Joker. Yes, there may be a lot of hype about him due to his passing but don't let that fool you, his performance is amazing. The Joker is scary...scary in that you don't know what he's capable of doing. He's a true psychopath. His jokes have you laughing one minute and his actions will have you cringing the next. He's a bit like Hannibal Lecter in that aspect and that's what makes Ledger's portrayal so great.Aaron Eckhart gives a great performance as Harvey Dent/Two Face. He inspires you as the brave DA and then inspires sympathy for his fall. All the rest of the cast is just as good as these three main actors. Spoilers below:The Nolan brothers do a great job in this film, they really do. One example is that I truly believed that they had killed LT Gordon off and I couldn't believe it. The audience clapped when he revealed himself in the trap to catch The Joker and when we see Gordon show up at his home and see his wife and son react to his still being alive; that's the type of drama that just wasn't there for the earlier Batman films.I will say that I wanted a better ending. I wanted The Joker to die; instead he was left hanging there, presumably for the SWAT team to take into custody and presumably to bring him back in another film. Of course Ledger passed on and I have no clue how they could possibly replace him in the role. I also thought the last fight between Batman and The Joker should have been longer with more combat though I understand the real fight was more of a spiritual fight; for the soul of Gotham and whether or not the citizens had given in to the fear that The Joker inspired. When The Joker said 'you and me could do this forever' to Batman, I agreed and I would still be watching them!All that said, I do intend to see it again and yes that means I'll drop another $10-15 at the theater but I think this movie is worth it and it's hard to say that these days.",10,3,7,22 July 2008
Avatar," Great special effects but...could have been much better
","I've seen this movie twice now; both times in 3D.The visuals are spectacular without a doubt. James Cameron has always been on the leading edge of breaking new ground in special effects. You are really immersed in the world of Pandora.The plot though leaves something to be desired. Basically, you have the hero with a tragic past who goes on a mission for the bad guys. He meets up with the locals and realizes that he was working for the bad guys and changes sides and all the clichéd characters are there from the evil gung-ho Marine colonel to the jealous but noble native warrior.If you've seen Dances with Wolves or Last Samurai, or The Mission or any of a dozen of movies with a plot line like that, then you've seen this and you know exactly what is going to happen.Then we come to the plot holes.1. It took the ship 5 years to get to Pandora. Sully's brother had trained for 3 years prior to this for the 'mission.' So they had a mission almost 10 years in the making? The situation on the ground in Pandora wouldn't have changed in that 10 years? Really? I mean it looked like the operation on Pandora was relatively new...I'm pretty sure the evil corporation would have gone ahead and knocked down the tree long before Sully got to the planet. 8 years is a long time.2. Unobtainium....really? That was the best James Cameron could come up with? So it's a rare material but what does it do? Surely, Cameron could have come up with something better than that.3. If arrows couldn't penetrate the cockpit windshields in the scene where they destroy the hometree, then how could they do so in the final battle? 4. Speaking of the military equipment...wow, pretty flimsy. The heavy machineguns are obviously just M-60's with a few pieces of metal (or rubber) slapped on the sides. But the transports were pretty vulnerable to...just about everything. In 150 years, that's the best we've come up with? The mech-warrior things were cool but again...pretty vulnerable. I have to wonder if this was the part of the movie that James Cameron came up with 15 years ago and just didn't notice that the trend is unmanned.5. If the vortex cause all sorts of complications with the instruments in the transports...why were communications unaffected and why wasn't the Avatar program disrupted in there as well? 6. So the master plan to defeat the Navi was to fly a slow-moving transport aircraft as a makeshift bomber to bomb the tree? They couldn't bomb the place from orbit? And before someone jumps on me for the gravitational flux or whatever...no. They were able to get orbital imagery so they could have easily just fired some cruise missiles or whatever the future evil corporation has and carpet bombed that whole region. The first rule of combat is to kill your enemy from as far away as possible and a former (or current) Marine Recon Lt Col would know that.8. As for the end battle...what was the ground assault for? The main effort was to bomb the tree into oblivion, right? So...why send in your ground troops who were already outnumbered? Why not just send in your fast attack ships to just fire incendiary rockets at the tree and call it a day? 7. The Avatar Navi bodies were genetically engineered to reach full maturity in a short amount of time...you gotta think that such engineering would also cause a short lifespan for such a creature. After all, Sully and his brother before him were supposed to be on a 6 year mission so why create something to last longer? Not a big point but it'd be interesting to see in Avatar 2 that Jake Sully's avatar begins a rapid decline in health, haha.8. So the evil corporation just left before they got punched in the nose? Yeah, they wouldn't just come back with more firepower or anything and just blast like a 1,000 square kilometer area into smoldering ruin from where they would build a new base.I suppose the message Cameron is sending is 'hey, don't pay attention to the flimsy plot line, look how beautiful this world is that I created!' The other messages were just lame. Hey James Cameron, Bush isn't in office any more and hopefully you weren't saying that Saddam Hussein was like the Navi...because yeah, you can bet that Hussein would have been 10 times as worse as the evil mercenaries were.And the irony of this film which cost upwards of 400 million to make and took the cutting edge of technology and probably had quite a carbon footprint...yet technology is evil and we should all go back to nature where there will be complete harmony......yeah.....",6,9,17,3 January 2010
From Hell," A good mystery/thriller based on history
","The real Jack the Ripper case is mystery enough, add in some intrigue and conspiracies and it makes for a great story. The film does a great job of transporting you to Victorian London; everything from the clothes and buildings to the attitudes of 'non-civilized peoples' really set the mood. There were a few problems; Heather Graham always appears to have just stepped out of the shower. For being a common street prostitute, she is remarkably clean and tidy. Her accent seems to come and go at some points as well. Johnny Depp does a good job as the conflicted inspector and Robbie Coltrane is as usual perfect (of course he didn't have to pretend to be English). Ian Holm also was very good.Spoilers:As for the plot line, it keeps you involved. There are enough misdirections so that you're suspecting the wrong people through most of the film. The idea that the Jack the Ripper was involved in a Masonic plot to protect the Royal line was a bit far-fetched though. Also, at one point, Ian Holm says he can no longer practice medicine because of a medical condition yet he states that the Ripper would have to have a steady hand...now perhaps the doctor was able to have steady hands by taking absinthe and laudanum.Overall, it was pretty good. It's worth your time to watch. There's some nudity and sexual content as well as a lot of violence (though it is done in short bits so you know what is happening but don't actually see it).",7,0,1,22 October 2007
The Descent," I Feel Cheated
","I was completely with this movie up until the ending, which really was terrible.Spoilers:Okay, the premise of being trapped underground has been done a few times in the last half decade, but this one was pretty good.Essentially, there are a close group of women who are thrill-seekers. There is a not-so-fleshed out love triangle with one of the women and another woman's husband (who is quickly killed in a car wreck, as is the daughter of the same woman).A year later, the women are in North Carolina to do some cave-exploring. More women are involved. A total of 6 women head off to explore the cave without any male supervision, so you know it won't end well (I'm joking). We soon learn that the leader of the group (and the one having the affair with the other's deceased husband) did not take them to the cave they all thought they were going to, meaning the Park Service won't know where to look for them. Plus, no one has ever explored the cave. Great setup, actually, even if they are stupid decisions.After exploring a while, the group become trapped after a small cave-in. The further on in the caves they go, the more creepy it gets. Finally, we see the creatures, which are very scary. Eventually, the group are attacked and a couple are killed, while the others scatter and the rest of the film is them eventually getting picked off.The ending was fine, until we see it was a trick ending. The real end apparently is Sarah waking up after dreaming she had escaped. She wakes up and sees her daughter with a birthday cake in front of her. The camera pans out to reveal that no, her daughter is not actually in the cave and we hear the screams of the crawlers. I still don't get the dreams or how they played into the plot and why the ending was supposed to be satisfying. Apparently, originally, this ending was only released outside the U.S. I would have given this movie a better rating if the U.S. ending had been the one I watched. I think the ending that leaves you hanging only works sometimes and we went through so much in this movie that we deserved a better ending.The acting is good The creatures are well-done the setting is perfect Only the ending totally ruined it for me.",5,1,2,27 March 2012
The Departed," Not that good
","Well I'm a fan of Scorsese but I just didn't think this was all that great.It was long, had a lot of well-known actors, had a lot of profanity and some short scenes of violence...but it just didn't rise to all the hype. This film just didn't have the depth that other films had. I never really felt involved in this film; unlike other Scorsese films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, or Casino. Even Gangs of New York drew you in more than The Departed. Perhaps it's because this is a remake or maybe Scorsese has just lost his touch, who knows. The problem I had with the plot is that for 2 hours, there's a quasi-cat and mouse game between the police and Nicholson's organization. Both have moles and both are trying to find them. Then of course there's the other plot line of the police actually trying to bring down the mob boss. Then suddenly, there's a random shootout at the dockyard where all of Nicholson's goons are killed including Nicholson by his own spy within the police because Nicholson was an FBI informant? The final 15 minutes or so are just too much...everyone dies. While surprising, once you think about it, this was really a dumb move...you end up wondering why you just watched the movie. Consider the exact opposite and you'll understand why...everyone lives and nothing changes, kind of dumb when you think about it.Another point was the abandoned romance sub-plot. In reality, you could have left that whole part out and it would not have affected the film one bit. And why would this woman who just moved in with Mark Wahlberg decide to cheat on him with Leo Decaprio? It was like they were going to make that an important part of the plot but it ended up being nothing.As for the actors. I think at this point in his career, Jack Nicholson cannot be any other character except for the deranged socio-path with sarcastic lines. Comedy, drama, you name it, he's the same guy. Mark Walhberg did an okay job but it seemed like they wanted to establish that he was the stereotypical tough-talking Boston cop really quickly. He was overdone in my opinion. Leonardo Decaprio has already played this role...Gangs of New York. Matt Damon was decent. The rest were okay.I think had Scorsese worked with the plot some, casted some lesser known actors like he used to do and gone more in-depth on the characters, it would have been better. In my opinion, if this movie had been made by anyone else, it would not have even been nominated for an Oscar.I've tried to watch it again, thinking maybe I would like it better...by the time Matt Damon joins the special unit, I was done...I popped it out and watched re-runs.",6,8,14,28 February 2007
30 Days of Night," Good Except for the Ending
","I thought this was a pretty unique take on the vampire story. I liked the feeling of hopelessness that you felt as you watched Barrow Alaska cut off from the world for 30 days. Just that alone is enough to make someone feel uncomfortable. Add in these brutal monsters and you've got a great setting for a horror film.Josh Hartnett did pretty well as the sheriff and the rest of the acting was good. The special effects (blizzards, snow, etc) were all pretty good as well.The story is basically, that this town of Barrow Alaska which gets cut off for a month every year as it gets no sun at this time. On the last day before the darkness, the sheriff investigates a bunch of strange incidents, such as someone stole several cell and satellite phones and burned them. He then picks up a stranger who was accosting the waitress in the diner. He cryptically warns them of 'them' and it isn't long after that the power goes out and then the attacks begin. They start slowly at first, at people on the outskirts of town. Then, these creatures just unleash hell.Then, a small group of survivors must find a way to stay alive as they piece together who these brutal people are that are eating their neighbors. They must move around to different safe areas while avoiding the vampires.There were a few problems with the plot that I found. The first was during the first night of the attacks, Josh Hartnett is moving around town with little trouble. This after a scene of the vampires chasing down people in the streets. How's he moving around, in a truck, without being attacked? Then there are the people hiding in the diner. In that same scene of the vampires attacking the people, you see them breaking into houses and stores...so why weren't they breaking into the diner which seemed to be near the center of the town.The head vampire periodically gives random speeches to his brethren in some sort of language and some of what he said just was like it was taken straight out of Nietzsche, 'that which can be broken should be broken' and so forth.(major spoiler here) When Josh Hartnett injects himself with the vampire blood, he says 'I can smell your blood.' Wouldn't the vampires be able to sense or smell these survivors even if they were hiding in an attic or a general store? Speaking of the ending, I didn't really like it. Yes I know, it was a throwback to his earlier speech about 'doing anything for family member' but I just felt him becoming a vampire to fight the head vampire was a little too much. I also thought that the vampires would have simply all attacked him at once. I thought it would have been better had he followed the vampires back to their ship or wherever they were hiding and either joined them or destroyed them. Ah, but why not leave it open to endless sequels like every other horror film! Overall, it was a good film. There were a few moments early on that made me jump. It would have been nice to explain the backstory a little bit. Was the stranger a member of the crew on that cargo ship and how did that cargo ship get there. It was obviously frozen in place so they were there for a while. Also, the vampires wore pretty modern clothes and they looked like they came from different parts of the world. Maybe in the sequel, they'll explain that...and you know they will make a sequel...they always make sequels.",7,1,1,9 March 2008
1408," Best horror film to come out in a long time
","Having read the short story first, I pretty knew what was going to happen...or I thought I did. The film is very similar to the short story but not totally. I'll leave it at that.John Cusack made this film work. He captured the madness and the fear that the character was going through while enduring the room. You really get drawn into the movie.This movie isn't all that violent or bloody; instead the horror is psychological. This type of horror is really rare these days when directors rely instead on trying to instill nausea rather than fear what with all the blood, maiming, torture, etc... This is the good Stephen King type of horror.Spoilers:I liked how they showed Mike Enslin prior to showing up at the Dolphin Hotel. The short story only alludes to Mike's other travels. I felt that it really built the character up well. I did feel that the scary parts of the film were all compacted in the middle. I also wasn't fooled by the 'it was just a dream' sequence though they made that part longer than one expected in an attempt to fool you, it was just too obvious to me. I seem to remember that in the short story, there is more detail about the deaths in the room. I would have liked to seen more 'ghosts' or images as well as the back stories for the victims. Especially the guy with the hammer who periodically came after Mike. Though I suppose the director left that up for the individual viewer to play with in the mind.I was a little surprised that Stephen King didn't have a cameo anywhere or maybe I missed it and no one else caught it either. He usually has a cameo in his films but then again, this really wasn't marketed as a Stephen King film...",8,0,0,11 October 2007
Casino Royale," Bond takes a de-tour...
","Sorry, to me this wasn't a Bond film. The only thing this film had to do with the Bond series is the name James Bond.It's not the lack of gadgets or the missing Q...it was just the lack of a certain atmosphere.While it was an interesting take on Bond, it almost seemed like it was more of a knock-off type spy movie. You could have changed the names of the characters and this film would have tanked.I never felt comfortable with Craig playing Bond; he seemed too rough around the edges and too human...yes I know, that's realistic but we don't go see Bond films to see realism. And yes, the novels portray a scarred tough Bond but then again Ian Fleming worked with the earlier films to give us the on-screen Bond that we all know.Bond villains are generally supposed to be tough, in control...the villain here seemed weak and incapable. He was a middle-man; someone hardly worth Bond's time or at least worth an entire film if you know what I mean.Overall, it was slightly entertaining; get it on netflix or something to pass a few hours...but this isn't a Bond film I'd watch again as I do other Bond films. As the film really seemed to drag in some parts, especially during the casino scenes.This is not the right direction for Bond films...sorry, it just misses the mark.",5,3,4,5 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," JJ Abrams is overrated
","I was pessimistic when I learned JJ Abrams was going to be taking on Star Wars. While he was 'successful' in the reboot of the Star Trek films, he seems incapable of directing a film without a contrived plot that is about as coherent as something written by a 5th grader.Okay, I had no problem having Finn crash land and run into Rey and BB-8. It's everything after that. Amazing that the Millennium Falcon just happens to be on the same planet in the same village that these two need to escape from. Amazing that they get picked up in space by non other than Han Chewy. Amazing that Han and Chewy decide to take them to the same backwater world where there is a wise ... individual who just so happens to have Anakin/Luke's lightsaber. Yeah, I get it, the Force works through everything, but come on. This isn't the Force at work. We've seen this sort of collection-of- coincidences-equals-plot in the Star Trek reboots. When looked at with a critical eye, this sort of plot is about as sturdy as a cardboard box in a hurricane.The rest of the story was pretty simple. There's a giant planet- destroying base (quite original) and it's going to destroy the Resistance. This is the third such super-weapon plot device in the Star Wars franchise. They've ceased to become impressive, especially given how easily they are destroyed.And the characters? Han Solo ... the best you could do was make the hero of the Galactic Civil War reverting back to a smuggler? It's like his character did absolutely no evolving in the 33ish years since we first met him at that cantina. Rey was fine, but I think we all sort of can predict her future. Why not giving us her full name or showing us who her parents were, that means you're hiding something. I wouldn't be surprised if she is a Skywalker. What a great story to pit two descendants of Anakin against one another? Finn. A bit over the top, and it didn't necessarily fit in with the Star Wars universe. They should have toned down his character a bit. Kylo Ren. Not bad. I think everyone was expecting a Vader clone and we got a guy who is still learning. Captain Phasma. Who? Everyone got excited about the chrome stormtrooper. All she did was walk around issuing orders and then get taken prisoner. That stormtrooper with the shock stick thing was more of a bada^^ than Phasma. General Hux. Definitely not on par with previous villains. Too young. They could have cast a much older actor and the role would have done better.I'm glad that Abrams ISN'T running the next installment. Maybe we'll get more story--a more complete story",6,18,22,9 April 2016
The Purge," Cheap Political Statement rather than a film
","Whenever someone makes a movie that is first and foremost a political statement, it won't be good, unless of course you think the message is right.The Purge is a left-wing view of they see people who believe in individual liberty and the right to self-defense. Obviously, gun ownership is evil and only leads to more violence... Throw in some jabs at greedy Wall Street and this is essentially what this movie is.Even without the annoying political statements, the film is a let-down. Spoilers ahead!First, even common sense will tell you that the entire premise of this movie is deeply flawed. Crime is at an all-time low because people get to kill one day a year? Do the writers even know what the motivators are in crime? Somehow, rape, robbery, murder, and other crimes just decline because people can kill without criminal prosecution? Right! Look, the premise is interesting, but come on, put some more thought into it. People won't stop stealing just because they can murder at will one night...and murder wouldn't cease to exist because most murders are not meticulously planned out...they occur in the heat of the moment, either through rage or surprise (think a spouse murdering his/her spouse during an argument or after finding them cheating; or consider a robbery gone bad). Second, the idea that having one day a year where murder is legal will somehow keep unemployment down makes no sense. Unemployment is not a fixed number, it is related to the size of the population and there will always be unemployment regardless of the population size. When you consider the homicide rate now for a year you'll find it much higher than anything that could occur in a 12-hour span in one night. So if anything, the population would skyrocket and there would be MORE unemployment.As for the plot itself, it was very basic. A family is besieged in their house after the son lets in a homeless guy running from crazed killers. The crazed killers are of course pros at entering a house and have all the right equipment and know-how...oh, and they are apparently trust-fund babies or something. There's a bunch of killing and at the end the homeless guy saves the day, which was about as predictable as it gets. Oh and throw in a brief subplot where the daughter's boyfriend is hiding in the house and tries to kill the Dad, but he is shot and dies...and that's it for that.Plenty of plot holes though. So, they have this security system that they only need for one year...yet the entire family (at least the son and dad) know the security code by heart? The son deftly enters the code to let in the homeless guy. Sorry, but in 8 years, we'll have more security codes and passwords than we can remember and there's no way the family will know it by heart when they only use it once a year.And what is a homeless doing in a neighborhood like that? They make a point several times in the film to say that they live in a very safe area...presumably without any homeless people. Are we to believe that the killers chased the guy miles and miles to a posh neighborhood?Then there's the trust-fund hit squad. They're all wearing creepy masks (for the cheap effect of creeping out the audience) but for anyone who remembers Halloween masks...they're very difficult to see out of...much less stalk your prey and commit murder in. And they're experts at breaking into fortified houses? Their special equipment consists of some Ford F-150s and chains? Really? Just what did they attach the chains to? The steal plates didn't appear to have any convenient hook points, so...? Plus, how did they rip off ALL the steel plates? There were only two trucks and it would have taken a while for them to get to each window...probably several hours, and you can't tell me that the ENTIRE house was accessible to vehicles that had enough room for the trucks to maneuver in order to pull those plates off. I mean as a home-security expert, the Dad should have known that the best way to prevent someone from entering your home is to limit the number of approaches and entry points. For instance, you don't allow someone from the street easy access to your entire house from the outside. You put up fences, you plant trees, you make it very difficult for someone to get in. I'm sure their house would have been a tougher nut to crack than we saw.I hear they're going to make a sequel to this movie...great, another series of bad 'horror' movies that get pawned off to the public. Don't spend money on this movie...watch it on TV or see it on Netflix or something. There are better films in the genre than this...way better.",4,7,12,21 August 2013
300," Great movie
","I've always loved history and I study it constantly. I did not watch 300 with any notion that I'd be seeing a movie that was historically accurate. With that in mind, I was surprised at some of the little details that were accurate, (of course much of it is still inaccurate but hey it's a movie).This movie is also not right-wing propaganda. If you think so, then perhaps you should re-examine your own outlook and see just how far to the left you have gone. You might as well claim that Braveheart and Gladiator are also right-wing propaganda. Of course, any film that promotes strength would be considered right wing to the Daily Kos readers that are on here. Okay, for the facts, here we go:Fact, King Leonidas did lead about 300 Spartans into the Hot Gates...with about another 4,000 Greeks or so. This was in junction with a Greek Naval action that held off the Persian navy and forced Xerxes to land further to the North, thus forcing him to confront the Greeks.Fact, the Persian Empire covered parts of Africa, The Middle East, and yes, Persia (modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc). Thus, there were Africans, Egyptians, Arabs and surprisingly, Persians in the Persian army. Another small fact is that the Spartans and other Greek city-states were in fact Greek, thus they would appear white, kinda like they did in the film. Yes I know we're all used to seeing every possible ethnic makeup on screen to appease the race-baiters, but it wouldn't make sense to have a Greek Phalanx made up for anyone but white guys, right? Kinda like how the film Zulu had black men play the Zulu forces...As for the dialog...again, if you think this is right-wing, then perhaps you're just that far to the left. Now as for the film itself. It is very entertaining. You'll get the general gist of the historical action but do not take the film as an accurate portrayal of how the events really happened. There is no record that Xerxes used Rhinos or elephants in his invasion of Greece. That's just an example but you get the point.The film is violent but it's not incredibly bloody. There's nudity but it's not pointless nudity. Hopefully, you'll watch this film and want to know more about the time and the events.",9,3,7,6 August 2007
