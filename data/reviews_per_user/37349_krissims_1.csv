The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Omg
","Omg - that movie absolutely does the book justice. I was disappointed in Eclipse as it glossed over my favorite chapter from the book on the bed scene, portraying it as a trivial event and not the heart stopping scene I had pictured in my head. Breaking Dawn by comparison had brilliant effects, especially with Bellas pregnancy scenes, it had beautiful love scenes and the wedding scene was spectacular. The ending left me begging for more. I can not wait 12 months. I went to see Breaking Dawn with my girlfriend who had only seen the movie about 12 hours before at the midnight session. She was ready for a third sitting.... I too expect to see it at the movies again.",Null,10,38,17 November 2011
