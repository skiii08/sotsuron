National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Critics are dumb
","These National Treasure movies are so entertaining that sometimes I wonder what critics are on. They hated the first one, which we all enjoyed, and now they hate the second. Gee whiz, who would have guessed? It wouldn't be a problem if I didn't think some people were influenced by them. This is a typical sequel. It's got the same sort of things happening to the same cast members and it's a whole lot of fun. Isn't that enough? It's suitable for the whole family, no naked people, curse words, blood or guts, and nothing too scary. It's got an unrelenting pace of adventure and clue solving that gives you less opportunity to go potty than the first film. The only difference is instead of the very sexy Sean Bean as the villain, you have the very sexy Ed Harris.Anyone who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle for a couple of hours to drift into a light-hearted adventure, here's your movie.",7,3,8,23 December 2007
Mission: Impossible III," One of the better action movies
","I thought it was really good considering that I hated the first two. I really didn't care about the love story, however. I don't know why people think that's necessary. I guess it's so females will be interested but I'm a female and I couldn't have cared less about that part. But the action scenes were top-notch. I don't think I've seen a movie that was more actiony really. Imo, this is how James Bond movies should be. They're always a little too slow for me. They should be this action packed. And I believe this movie is the definition of action packed.The cast was great. Here you have really good actors in a movie that probably doesn't require good acting but it's nice to see that they can do this as well. Philip Seymour Hoffman I thought made a cracklin' good villain. He wasn't in it as much I thought but he was great. I actually liked him better here than in Capote. I don't think I've ever seen Maggie Q before. I think I would have remembered because she is absolutely gorgeous. A nice addition to the team. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a favorite of mine and there wasn't as much of him as I'd hoped but I'm just glad that he's getting roles like this one. Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup were good as usual but I got a little confused about what was going on with their characters at one point. And Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. Either you love him or hate him but you're still going to watch his movies and this one is highly entertaining. It's definitely a blockbuster that's worth seeing. The stunts this man does. There is one scene where he is running that it so impressive. Probably the least dangerous of the action scenes but to me that was the best.Anyway, if you like action movies you should definitely see it.",7,1,2,5 May 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Bale and Crowe are terrific together
","They really make this movie. I don't know how good it would have been with other actors. In the trivia, I just saw that Cruise and Bana were originally considered for this. Well we dodged a bullet there. Crowe and Bale just seemed so comfortable on screen not really playing against each other, but it was more like playing together, like two guys in a band. Bale, as Dan Evans, would be on bass and Crowe, as Ben Wade, on lead guitar. And I guess in a weird way the frontman would actually be one of the supporting cast members, Ben Foster as Charles Prince. The other members of the cast did a great job too.I don't see this as a real gunslinger type of movie. I mean it has shootouts and action scenes but it's very deliberate and not too showy. I haven't seen the original yet so I can't compare it. But compared to the other westerns I've seen this is one of the good ones. I believe it's rated R but I'm not too sure why. Maybe an 'F' word flew past me that I didn't notice or something, but apart from normal Western type violence (the kind where you see the bullet go in, not the shooter standing there), there wasn't much in it other than that there was a half-naked bum. But that's it. So I'd say it's great for anyone 13 and older. Even maybe a little younger if you have a younger Western fan in the family.edit: I have seen the original now and I have to say this one is better. I'm not a remake fan but this is how remakes should be done. It's different enough to be worth making and it's the still the same story so it's not just an excuse to make money off of a recognizable title. The main differences are the length of it, maybe half an hour more, and the characters are more complex in this one.",9,2,5,7 September 2007
Stop-Loss," 'Coming Home' for a new generation
","It's horrible that we need a new one, you'd think people would learn their lesson the first, or hundredth, time they were taught it. But anyway, the movie is pretty good. At the very beginning it reminded me of 'Redacted' and then later 'In the Valley of Elah' and you could say with most movies that that would be a detriment but they're all telling stories about the same subject. So it's not like anyone is copying anyone else.This movie is more movie-ish than those I mentioned. It works as entertainment(that sounds wrong) as well as being informative. It's showing you a certain situation people are going through but it's also a 'movie', with action scenes, good acting, relationship issues, etc. As I said the acting is good. Ryan Phillipe is I want to say underrated, but maybe he's not rated at all. He's an extremely good looking person who could have just been in romantic comedies and made some nice money that way, but instead he's carved out an interesting resume for himself. He does some of his best work here. Joseph Gordon Levitt, everyone's favorite young indie actor, shows up here as well, although he has a smaller role than he normally does. He and the rest of the cast were also really good. Ciaran Hinds makes an interesting cowboy, btw. I wouldn't have guessed that. The only problem I may have had with the film is that I didn't like the ending. But that doesn't take away from the fact that I think this is a well-made movie.The film is serious. It'll probably be depressing for most people. But hey life is depressing right now. Especially for people involved in this situation and maybe those folks should consider whether they should really watch it or not. Because I would think they'd want to escape that reality. The people who aren't paying attention to what's going on should see it. I'd have less problem recommending this to them. I think it's the least likely of the Iraq based movies to offend anyone. It's got a few violent war scenes but nothing over-the-top or terribly graphic. It's just basically wave at you saying 'hel-lo, this is the stuff you're trying to ignore but should really be paying attention to.' There is a normal amount of cursing and no naked people that I can remember.If you haven't been watching the Iraq war centered movies, it's time you saw one and this would probably be the easiest to take.",8,37,56,4 April 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not too much of a comedy
","I just got back from my second viewing of Forgetting Sarah Marshall (there was something wrong with the sound the first time) and I have to say I see it a little differently now. At first you remember all the funny parts because you know it's supposed to be a comedy but even still it seems more like a romantic comedy. But on second viewing you notice that it's really much more of a relationship movie and not even a romantic comedy. Most of the laughs go to the supporting players. The lead character played by Jason Segel, who I'm sure you know also wrote it, is just a guy going through a break up. So even if some of the situations are comical it's still kinda sad and you don't want to laugh at him. It's not a bad thing but if people go expecting to laugh the whole time I think they could be slightly disappointed. It's really a heartfelt movie about a poor guy who is trying to get over a woman he probably shouldn't have been with in the first place. The funny stuff happens around him.Jason Segel is great. I've been a fan since 'Freaks and Geeks' and I think he did a great job especially with the musical aspects of the movie. I loved Russelll Brand and Jonah Hill. I thought their scenes together were the best parts of the movie. And today I realized that the best chemistry was between all the male characters instead of between the male/female pairings. Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are talented young actresses don't get me wrong. I just didn't sense a lot of chemistry between them and the guys. But that would really be my only complaint. Paul Rudd again is hilarious in a teensy supporting role. It was an enjoyable movie that most adults should like. And I mean adults. I'm not saying teenagers can't see naked people. That's up to their parents. But it's about adult relationships that don't really concern them yet.",8,2,9,6 May 2008
Hostel," Well made
","I think I was expecting something really cheesy and bad. That's why I took this long seeing it. But it was actually really good. It reminded me of a few movies like American Werewolf in Paris (which isn't as bad as it's supposed to be either) and Suspiria and Oldboy in spots. It wasn't nearly as gory as I expected and except one scene toward the very end I wasn't really freaked out. But mind you during that scene I had my hands out in front of me going 'stop, STOP!'.As far as the story goes, I thought it was great. The only thing I would have changed was something that Kana did. I didn't want her to do that but in reality it totally makes sense that she did. Jay Hernandez was great. There's something really likable about him, besides being cute, that I think you need in someone who's in peril. I also liked the main villain. The more normal they look the creepier they are. And speaking of looks I thought the movie was actually very beautiful to look at. Which is something you used to get with horror movies all the time. Now, not so much.I can't imagine why it has such a low rating (5.8 as I'm writing). Unless lots of people who just don't go for that sort of thing voted on it. But I don't understand what they would be doing watching it anyway. I don't really consider myself a horror fan but I do appreciate the good ones. I definitely think this fits into that category.",8,2,3,26 June 2007
Spider-Man 2," Didn't like it
","**spoilers**There obviously must be something wrong with me since everyone is saying this is the best comic book movie ever but I just didn't like it. It started off well but then it went all wrong for me. I don't think this Doc Ock guy was interesting enough as a villain. Spidey giving up his spideyness has been done before and better in Superman II when he gave up his powers for Lois. And there were a lot of similarities to the Superman movies that made this seem like I'd already been through it. I also don't understand how the writers thought it was okay for so many people to know who Spider-Man's alter ego is. Oh yeah, they won't tell, I forgot. Sheesh. I started to get aggravated with this movie because of the constant reminders of how difficult Peter's life is, especially the scenes with Aunt May. Was he late all the time and penniless? I'm not too sure. They only pointed that out a million times. Where it completely lost me was after Peter and Ock left the cafe. But the actors were okay for the most part and there was one very good scene in an elevator. I was expecting the best comic book movie of all time because of the hype, but it turned out to be worse than the first one, which I didn't think was that great either. It's too bad because I usually enjoy comic book movies. It gets a 4/10 from me. I'll stick with the X-men.",4,1,2,30 June 2004
"I Love You, Man"," It's so different to me
","I don't consider this a comedy, and I said the same thing after 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. I think we need a new word for these movies because they're not really dramas and I laughed a lot, but they're just not comedies. For the record I liked this a lot more that FSM, which I thought was alternately brilliant and dull depending on the scene. This movie has a really steady pace and I really enjoyed it. I thought while watching it, 'This movie is just like a hug.' Seriously it's just a really sweet movie about nice people who are friends and want to be decent to each other and help each other out, except for the one guy (played by Jon Favreau) but he was even cool.I liked everyone in it. But the movie is mostly about Paul Rudd and Jason Segel who are a great duo. I actually thought that it would be nice if a performance like Rudd's would get attention during awards season. They usually don't, these understated but really genuine performances. This is going to go down and one of his best roles. And Jason Segel, I don't know if he's really like that, but I'm always waiting for him to turn out to be a serial killer or something. (And don't take that the wrong way because he was my favorite on 'Freaks and Geeks' back in the day.) He's playing this real oddball and you just don't know what to make of him until almost the end and it's like a surprise that shouldn't have been. I can't explain it without spoiling but and I can't even come up with a movie to compare it to.Like I said I think it's different. It's so very much it's own movie, and I just want to kiss it. It's so likable. It's like a teddy bear, or hot chocolate or Up with People. So if you like nice things, you should go see it.",8,4,12,20 March 2009
Superbad," I laughed hard and often
","There are many different kinds of comedies out there. Some that make you smile, some that make you chuckle occasionally, and then the actual funny ones that make you laugh out loud. Superbad is one of those. I went to see this movie because of Michael Cera who I thought was the funniest person on the funniest television series in history, 'Arrested Development'. And he's hilarious in this as well, but so are all three of the lead characters. I'd nominate them for something if I could. I grew up in the 80s when movies about kids trying to 'lose it' before graduation seemed like it's own genre. So I was interested to see an update since I figured the newer generation were already grandparents at 25. Well it's good to see that nerds are still nerds and the entire populace hasn't gone crazy. It was interesting also because the people in it who are my age, like Rogen and Hader, are clearly the old people trying to recapture their youth, when I think most of us haven't completely grown up yet. It was sort of painful to see how the movie-isms we find funny are just old to the new kids. But this movie is definitely fun for people in their 30s we just have to realize that we're not them anymore and I think it helps. And it's smart. The jokes are really sharp and you have to listen because they almost roll into each other.There is a lot of cursing in this movie and I only say that because I know someone who doesn't like that sort of thing. If I didn't know someone like that I probably wouldn't notice. But since I do if you're one of those people that might bother you. And although the goal of the main characters is sex, it isn't a sex comedy in the traditional sense. It's mostly a quest for booze. And there is one thing that's kinda gross but I don't know how to describe it without spoiling it. But if any of that bothers you enough to deter from seeing this, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this anyway. Otherwise I think it'd be fun for anyone from 13-45 with a sense of humor.",9,5,12,17 August 2007
Alexander," Alexander, the so-so
","I was surprised that this movie actually wasn't good. I usually don't agree with the critics, and I'm not sure if I do here either. I may dislike it for entirely different reasons. My problems are basically that there was too much narration, too many close-ups, and just too many people.The narration. For the record I should say that one of my major complaints about The Grinch (2001), was Anthony Hopkins' narration. I'm not a fan of his voice and don't get why everyone else is. So if it was just your normal average amount of voice-over work it would have been bad enough for me. But here it seems as though they took away the story from most of the other actors and gave it to him. I dunno. When I watch a movie, it's to 'watch' a movie. I don't put on movies to have the story told to me. So my thinking is that the decision to give Hopkins the major storytelling duties was the main reason why this film went wrong.The close-ups. This surprised me. As I watched this I felt like at every moment I was only looking at a face, or an arm, or a mane. I couldn't tell what was going on in the battle scenes because they were too close. You see an arm and some dust and hear a clank, and what does that tell you? I have no idea. Usually when someone gets close-up happy it's because there is some huge star in it and they want to sell the movie based on how good-looking they are. But in this case there were scenes where I was looking at extra, after extra, after extra, who had no lines. And I'm thinking, gee, all the time that I'm wasting looking at these random people could have been spent advancing the story. But god knows if I wasn't staring at these people I'd be listening to more Ptolemy yikkity-yak.Too many people. I already brought up the extras. And I think it's great to actually hire people instead of CGI but, geez, not if that's going to happen. And beyond that mob scene, there is the problem of Alexander's posse. I'm no history buff, but I can't believe that Alexander constantly had a group with him every second. That's at least what it seemed like in this movie. I wondered if he even went to the toilet by himself. You didn't get any sense of who the characters around him were because it was like every actor in the scene got one line and they were always together, like they were a chorus or something. Did no one ever pull him aside for a private moment? Just his mom and his boyfriend? And speaking of his boyfriend, he hardly had anything to do with him. And I'm sitting there trying to figure out why. Gay or not, he was supposed to be his best bud and yet for the most part he was lumped in there with the rest of the posse. That didn't make any sense. I think Harry Potter and Ron Weasley have had more tender moments alone, not to even mention Frodo and Sam. So the idea that the audience can't handle a close male relationship on film without thinking it's sexual is really ridiculous at this point in time. So if it's an projected homophobia onto the audience that caused that relationship to suffer, that's silly. My other thought was that maybe they had so little faith in Colin that they dulled every other character down to avoid anyone outshining him.Too many people, part deux. I watched the behind the scenes stuff on the DVD and there seemed to be way too many people on the set looking like they were on a coffee break. I like huge productions, I like watching 'making of's. I've never seen anything that had a movie set resembling a mosh pit before. So I actually think this movie was doomed early on.I liked the cast, which makes the whole thing even more tragic. Maybe they could have picked a more obvious person for Alexander but Colin Farrell wasn't bad at all. (I disagree with Stone on who he resembles. Peter O'Toole, my foot. I personally kept being reminded of a late 80's Agassi). Jared Leto was underused. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, was horrifyingly underused. Rosario Dawson was basically naked. (I personally think her nakedness bordered on exploitation, and I'm not one to normally think things like that). Angelina Jolie's role was great somehow. And Val Kilmer was wonderful as usual, even if he looked exactly like the Ghost of Christmas Present in one scene. And I'm giving 4 of my 5 points to those actors who I feel got gypped. And everyone else on the production can split the other point. Was there set direction or costume design? I couldn't see any behind all the giant heads. And since everyone seems to want to compare this to Troy, I definitely am in the Troy camp.",5,2,2,11 August 2005
Match Point," This is just like a Woody Allen movie
","Edit: Upon further review and after having rewatched A Place in the Sun. I do think this movie is too close for comfort. Having not realized that upon first seeing it I had written the review below. I'll leave it in case the movie still appeals to you, even if it's not very original. ******Maybe all the people who keep saying that this is so different from everything else he's done haven't seen that much of what he's done. I think this is very much a Woody Allen film and a very good one at that. But a lot of the reviews I'm reading seem off to me. They call it a thriller. I wouldn't say that. They say it's got steamy sex scenes. Well, not really. I think they're selling this as something it's not.What it is is a compelling story of a former tennis player Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who's life is at a crossroads. When we meet him he's looking for work as a tennis instructor. He gets the job and as luck would have it he befriends a student of his, Tom (Matthew Goode), who has a more satisfying lifestyle than his own. Very quickly Tom opens the door to this lifestyle for Chris. So what was he supposed to do, not walk through it? Anyway one thing leads to another and Chris finds himself snared in a trap of his own desires, that pull him in opposite directions.From there on in I find this to be a character study. It's about what choices Chris makes and I find them all to be very difficult choices. And luck does play apart in what happens to him. But there is a view among people who've seen this movie that what should happen doesn't. Or that Karma's Army took a nap and someone gets away with something. But I think it's weird for people to have an assumption that this is how it works. Does every bad person you've ever met 'get theirs' in the end? No. So, I think this movie is an honest look at what probably happens a lot and takes a sympathetic view of someone who most people would consider to be a social climber who takes it to the limit. I don't see it that way. But that's probably why I think this is such a good movie. To me, he had to choose between two lives neither of which should have been his. If he made a fatal mistake it was when he accepted Tom's offer to the opera. After that, the die was cast.I've been a fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers for a while and I think this is one of his best performances. I've loved Woody Allen for a long time and I think this is one of his better movies. If you liked 'Interiors', as I did, you should like this. I know a lot of people are comparing it to 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' but the tone is totally different to me and I very much prefer this movie. I didn't understand what all the hubbub was about concerning Scarlett Johansson in 'Lost in Translation' but I do like her here. She's got a Gloria Grahame (love her!) thing going on in this movie and I thought she did a great job. The character Emily Watson played, Chloe, annoyed me, so I don't know if I can judge her performance properly, but it was that kind of mousy sheepish person that really shouldn't breathe. But all around the performances were good.Apart from being a movie buff, I'm a huge tennis fan as well, and I've drawn the net chord parallel to fate myself in the past. You see a guy playing his heart out who winds up losing a match because of a bad bounce or call. That's life isn't it? When you see that happen you feel bad for the loser but you can't blame the winner. They played the game and won. That's what this movie is about, a winner.",6,3,7,10 January 2006
Zodiac," Good not great.
","Not to say that there is anything wrong with it, there isn't. It's just not that exciting or gripping. For some reason I hadn't been aware of the Zodiac killer when I heard that this movie was being made, so I did a quick search to look up the main details. I guess that was the problem because once you know what happened the movie doesn't really add anything to make it suspenseful. And I guess I'm not really a fan of Fincher either. I don't like the way he uses that color enhancing effect in his movies. Must everything be greenish or brownish? I know that sounds like a lazy comment but it just gets aggravating after a while.The actors all do a fine job. The story is true so what can I say about that? The choice of two of my favorite songs from the era, 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' and 'Bernadette' made me a little happy, but the way the former was used was weird which I supposed was meant to be ironic. It really reads like I'm complaining but I guess I was just expecting something spectacular after reading all the reviews and it's just a good movie. As far as movies about serial killers go, I may be a bad judge because my favorite is Summer of Sam which is hardly about David Berkowitz. But then again neither is this, it's more about the investigation. So I guess in a way the movie it most closely resembles that I've seen is All the President's Men. Just darker and brownish-greenish.",8,8,20,2 March 2007
The Prestige," Reminded me of the Usual Suspects
","Which is saying something because The Usual Suspects is in my top ten movies of all time. I felt the same way watching The Prestige as that film. It has a real mystery, who-dun-it, who is Keyser Soze feel to it. I would be surprised if other Suspects fans didn't love this movie as much as I did.The first wonderful thing about it is that you have two of the most talented and charismatic actors of their generation playing against each other. I really love this match up and they both brought it. It's probably Hugh Jackman's best role so far. Christian Bale has had a more impressive resume so of course he's great here. But I thought they really complemented each other.The story itself is great. It's about two magicians competing against one another with vendettas intact. Great stuff. An interesting thing for me was the parallel of dueling real life magicians Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison. It was just a little touch but I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, once the rivalry really gets going it wraps around itself so many times that it pulls you in tight. I do admit to having figured it out before the end, but instead of feeling cheated as events unfolded the way I hoped they would, I just got more jazzed. I actually had unconvinced myself of one of my guesses only to have it turn out to be true which is the same thing I did with the identity of Keyser Soze. That's probably why I'm so reminded of that movie.I think that The Prestige is better than most of the Oscar nominees for Best Picture this year. I think the costume design is the best I've seen lately. Christopher Nolan hasn't done anything wrong yet. And I do think this is his best film.I actually have forgotten what the rating is for this film but I would recommend for most people over 10, who enjoy magic and mystery and great film-making.",10,3,4,22 February 2007
Crash," Wacky Comedy about La La Land
","And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe. The reason I describe it as a comedy is that it became that for me. Because very early in the film there are several moments that are so nonsensical that it kept taking me out of the movie. And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny.The first instance that I'm speaking about involves Brendan Fraser's character. (By the way, there is no way I'm going to use the character names because you don't get to know them enough to ever remember them. At best this movie is a '100 most racially motivated moments' countdown). So Brendan is some kind of politician and he's speaking to his handlers about how to spin something that has happened to him. He makes a suggestion and within the same minute finds that it is a bad suggestion, and tells his underling to 'give himself a raise for that one' as if he wasn't the one who made the suggestion in the first place. No one does that. Bosses blame their workers for all kinds of mistakes that they make but not something that he just said within the same minute. I must have missed the next 3 lines of dialogue because I was thinking about how silly that was.Later there is a scene with Matt Dillon and Loretta Divine. I've seen bits and pieces of it on TV shows as a promotional clip. In context, it's awful. Matt is being very friendly with her as he's hoping to find a solution with her to his father's medical/insurance problems. And then he suddenly turns on a dime and starts spouting his issues with Affirmative Action. I'm not even sure if he took a breath. Nobody does that. Ever.Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. First off Larenz Tate is one of the better journeyman actors in this movie and the fact that he had to take a role where he basically plays sounding board meant solely to respond to Ludicrous, who up until now has been a rap artist, and to eventually be a bull's-eye, makes me sad. After being in the business for as long as he has he should have the Ludicrous role. But he didn't have the instant fanbase that Ludicrous has, I guess. So anyway, the 'China-man' under the car. What was that? 'China-man' sounds like a superhero who saves expensive dishware. That scene played as though it was meant to be comedic. Scary.It all ended for me with the scene involving Don Cheadle and William Fichtner. Fichtner begins and ends a conversation with Don Cheadle with the question '--expletive-- black people, huh?' Yes, that expletive. And from there on in, I couldn't stop laughing. No one talks like that. Ever. I don't know how he got it out. He knows he'd never say that to a black person. And he knows he's never met anyone who would do that. And between the bookend questions he used the word 'black' about 89 times. Ridiculous. One day in the future Don Cheadle is going to sit down and watch this movie and see how racist it really is. Not that it's showing us racist people, that it is racist. So then wackiness ensues as Terrence Howard winds up in a car chase and does probably the stupidest thing any character in any movie has ever done, when he gets out of the car packing a gun and screaming insanities at a cop who is trying to stop him from getting shot. None of that makes any sense either but the moment when I fell out of my chair involves a Persian guy who hates buying doors and a little girl with a magic cloak. Remember in Pulp Fiction when God changed Coke to Pepsi? Well He's up to His Old Tricks again. Which I guess was an attempt to make the most predictable shooting in movie history unpredictable at the last minute. Awful.The piece de resistance. When that women started running into the hospital screaming 'Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!' I thought to myself 'oh please let 'China-man' be her husband, Larenz Tate being Don Cheadle's baby brother wasn't poetic enough' Wouldn't you know it? The gods of cinema fulfilled my request. *tear* And the best part? Her name was Kim Lee. KIM LEE. Amazing.This movie was bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. I did my best to give it a fair shake, but it wouldn't let me. It was unrealistic, the dialogue was atrocious, and a lot of the acting was sub par. And the final scenes were blatantly mooning the makers of Magnolia. Saying 'Look, we made a really bad version of your movie and we're going to prove how unoriginal we are by doing our own sad version of the 'Wise Up' scene but to play off that we're not, our actors won't sing. :P And the best part is we attached racism to it, so it'll get all kinds of praise it doesn't deserve.' As I said before at the very best it's a wacky comedy, at the very worst it's Best Picture as deemed by AMPAS. I don't know what they were thinking, if they were thinking. All I can do is laugh about the whole thing. But I do recommend that everyone see it, just to have their own opinion of it. I would never expect anyone to believe a review this one-sided, so please see it for yourself. But I promise you, these were my honest thoughts while watching this movie.",1,61,103,22 March 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Harry Potter and the Demon Barber of Fleet Street
","That's one of the alternate titles for the film I thought of while my mind drifted in the theater. Another was 'Everyone Says I Hate You'. Now obviously Sweeney Todd hates a few people but the real reason I came up with that is I was reminded of the Woody Allen musical from the 90s. In that film Mr. Allen wanted to make a musical where normal people with normal voices would just burst into song as if musicals happened in real life. Well that was the point in that film but Sweeney Todd is meant to be a proper musical but generally speaking it's cast can't sing. Now let me be specific Johnny Depp can actually sing. He has a very lovely voice, but I don't think Sweeney Todd should have a lovely voice. It should be forceful, vengeful, angry, not pretty. (I'm no musical expert but I felt like his voice was just the wrong range. Too high.) Helena Bonham Carter is a weak singer too and I even believe that the sound mixers pumped up the accompaniment at times to drown them out a little. Sacha Baron Cohen can sing but he only really sings one song. Alan Rickman has an icky speaking voice so it just makes you wonder why Tim Burton hired these people. Okay I know. He likes them, they're his friends, whatever. But I wish someone else had gotten their hands on this musical and cast people who could sing. Jamie Bower can sing but his acting amounted to a perpetual stink-eye.I had a bad feeling from the beginning about this one but I kept hearing how great it was and now that I've seen it I just think people don't want to say anything bad about Johnny Depp. I don't either but there are so many other actors in Hollywood that could have played this role that it makes me long for the movie I could have seen. On top of that I didn't buy him as an angry vengeful guy. He's too nice. It comes through. Every time he squished up his face because he was singing/angry he just looked like a bunny.On top of all that, it's too Tim Burton. I know he has his own style but because this was pre-existing material I would have liked it to look a little less typical Burton. One thing that I thought looked absolutely awful was the 'Clash of the Titans' vintage blood. When a character is killed in that film and the blood comes out it looks like spaghetti sauce. They got the same stuff for this film it seems. So all the people complaining about the blood in this film must eat their pasta plain. My one excuse for such sad looking blood was that it was some kind of throwback to the Hammer horror films, and it did seem like they were trying to make a Hammer musical but it was too dark and drained of all color for that. The attempts at humor didn't come off as dark comedy to me. It just strayed into silliness. So really I put it all on Tim Burton. I don't know what happened because I usually enjoy his films quite a bit. The one shining light was the little boy (Ed Sanders) who can sing and act.I have seen the DVD of the stage version of this musical with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury. So I'm going to say that it really didn't help me to enjoy this film. If you haven't seen that, I'd say see this film first, if you're interested, then go back and watch that. They changed a lot from what I can remember. But if you've seen the musical previously I can't imagine that you'd be very happy with this version. The other thing is that there have been many musical this year with great singing in them. So if this one gets recognized when those others should, that'll be very disappointing.I certainly hope people don't bring little kids to this because Johnny Depp's in it. Because even though it's pasta sauce and CGI meat, there's still a unhealthy dose of it.",5,3,26,21 December 2007
Blades of Glory," A few slight wobbles, but they stuck the landing
","I really enjoyed it. The very beginning seemed a little off. I don't know I think I was actually judging their skating at first. Ferrell looked like he wasn't doing anything but Heder looked pretty good and I guess I thought that I couldn't believe that anyone would think their performances were even close. I know it's a silly movie not a skating competition but as a figure skating fan those critical reflexes just kick in. Craig T. Nelson, I'm not a huge fan of either, so it took a while for me to adjust to what seemed to be a slow building to something. At least I was hoping it was.Well once we get to the point when they do decide to team up it's all smooth sailing from there. I personally have always wanted to see a pairs team made of two men so it's interesting that the thought occurred to someone else. I guess there was a fair amount of computer effects for the skating scenes but they came off really well. I saw a few figure skaters names during the credits for stunt work so I guess that's how they did it, but you couldn't tell. There were a lot of laughs especially from Will Arnett who, let's face it, is a god among men and I could have used more scenes with him. Blamey was alright. Jon Heder did a really good job as a stereotypical figure skater and I have to admit that he looked really good with that hair. Terrible but true. Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell. He does his normal thing as a dufus/sweetie. The only person I didn't like was that girl from The Office. I don't think she was good for this kind of comedy.I think fans of figure skating should love it and Will Ferrell fans should too. So that's everyone right? I was going to give it a 7 but then they used my favorite theme song for their final skate so that bumped it up to an 8/10.",8,3,6,30 March 2007
Gone Baby Gone," When Keeping It Real Goes Right
","I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",10,542,666,19 October 2007
Man of Steel," I wish I could give it a zero
","That's because it should not have been made.I had no use for another Superman film. The Christopher Reeve films are there for us forever. The filmmakers of Superman Returns made a huge error with their storyline and therefore created what turned out to be a bad experience, but I would have given them a second chance. When they announced MOS as a reboot, I did not understand why anyone would bother. But when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I figured there must be something good about it, since I love every film of his that I've seen.Well it's apparent that the only reason for this film was to make money. The ONLY reason. Sears, IHOP, 7-ELeven, and U-Haul logos are shoved into your face during one of the 'climactic' action scenes. And I mean you could see the washing machines at Sears. It was that bad. Beyond that those action scenes were just smashing scenes. Smashing buildings, smashing cars, smashing asphalt. The Hulk would have gotten sick of all the smashing. Just debris everywhere for a good half an hour. It literally made me tired. And the effects looked bad. People are tolerating this in movies lately for some reason but nothing about Superman flying or the explosions or the debris looked real. I don't understand how in 2013 the effects are looking faker/worse but they are. I guess to the video game crowd it doesn't matter, but my eyes want to believe what they're seeing even if it's a fantastical story.The actors can't be blamed. They wanted to be a part of Superman. I get that. The fact is there wasn't anything they could have done to improve or make this movie worse. It was always going to be utter garbage. The story is stupid, the dialog is atrocious. I really sat there for about two hours wanting to slap someone, anyone. I haven't written a comment here in so long, but I had to. It was just that bad.",1,255,497,18 June 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Pretty good intelligent comedy
","But it will remind you of a few movies you've already seen and perhaps have liked more. The overall story is new. It's about a messed up family who has to go together by van to see the young daughter compete in a 'Little Miss Sunshine' pageant. That's new. But if you've seen enough movies there are some events that happen along the way that you will be able to predict with incredible accuracy. You'll be reminded of 9 to 5, About a Boy (big time), National Lampoon's Vacation, or if not that, then Deconstructing Harry. At one point, I thought we were going to get a reference to Sparkle Motion. Maybe they were meant to be homages. I couldn't be sure.But even if every scene wasn't completely original it was very entertaining and funny and in some moments inspirational. I mean you've got an incredible cast here, most of all Alan Arkin, who should have had more screen time. Everyone else was great especially Abigail Breslin, who you probably remember from Signs. There are lots of laughs in it if that's what you're in the mood for but it's not a slapstick comedy. It's got some serious stuff too. It's definitely worth the money.",8,1,4,26 August 2006
Knowing," You have to wait for it
","but it kinda pays off. For most of this movie, I sat there with a smirk on my face. The dialogue was pretty hard to take and some of the plot was pretty silly in how convenient everything was. But in a reversal of what usually happens in movies it got better and more interesting and was actually saved by the ending. Unfortunately the ending was taken from a very popular song from the 80s which immediately starting blaring in my head. I really don't see how that could be a coincidence.It's interesting the thoughts that go through your head while watching a film. At one point I was thinking 'How much money does Nic Cage have now?' And I got to that point because I realized he's been making action movies for 10+ years and he started off as a really good and quirky actor. But now he just runs around solving puzzles and averting disaster. I'd really like to see him act again. He must have enough money by now.The movie is more of a horror movie than I was expecting. It's not gory or anything but it's full of horror elements and if you're comparing it to most horror films it's better than most of them. But there are many points where it's unintentionally funny. Still I have to give it credit, because it's trying to say things. It uses familiar elements but isn't like most movies you've seen. And I'll tell you the truth, I did not see this cribbed ending coming at all. Even though I've always hoped that is what will happen in that circumstance.There is some hammy kid acting and we really need to figure out what to do about Cage's hair. But this movie was watchable. And maybe even rewatchable for genre fans who don't need everything to be too smart. Give it a shot if you're bored with nothing else to watch or if you're interested by the premise, which is solid, but don't expect anything too amazing. It's passable, lots of bad but lots of redeeming stuff too.",7,1,3,28 March 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Better than expected and entirely quotable
","The trailers for this movie don't do it any justice. I thought it was going to be pretty bad. I mean it's silly, extremely silly but I laughed from beginning to end. The movie it reminds me most of is my #8 favorite movie of all time (yes I keep a list) 'Top Secret!'. Not since Nick Rivers have I seen such an amazing performance from a phony rock star. Also if you're a fan of cheesy biopics or 'Behind the Music', this should really entertain you. Surprisingly, to me at least, it also is a very good musical. I'm not kidding. John C. Reilly is much better here than in his Oscar nominated performance in 'Chicago'. This is going to sound wrong but this part just fits him better. And he's a really good singer. I'm thinking I just might buy the soundtrack.At different points you can see bits and pieces of 'Ray', 'Walk the Line' (of course), 'What's Love Got to Do With It', 'The Doors', every rock n' roll movie you can think of. Oh and I love the casting of the Beatles. Paul Rudd's awful portrayal of Lennon just rocked. You see, it's meant to be like all the bad TV movie portrayals of rock stars that you've seen. However, Jason Schwartzman could have passed for Ringo. But the casting of Paul is just priceless.The movie, as I said, is really well done. I kept thinking 'oh when I get home I'm going to use that quote as my sig'. And then the next one would be even better. For that reason I think this movie will become even better on repeated viewings. But it's not for everyone. There's nakedness in this movie, lots. And some cursing and silly drug use. So if that stuff bothers you, it's probably not for you but I'd say it's for people who don't get offended easily and are fine with laughing at other people. I loved it.",9,9,17,28 December 2007
Dreamgirls," Wow. And I thought it was going to be just 'okay'.
","Fantabulous. Stupendous. I can't even believe it. I've changed my pick for Best Picture this year so many times you'd think I have multiple personalities. But let me tell you it's just been a tremendous year for film. Kudos all around. I tell you none of the BP nominees last year, could compete this year. And I loved Brokeback Mountain and Munich.Dreamgirls is an amazing movie. I know what you're thinking. I didn't believe the hype either. But I saw it today and I actually don't think it's been hyped enough. Everyone deserves to be nominated. But it's just that kind of year, folks. Too many awesome performances not enough nominations. Of course the major buzz has been going to Jennifer Hudson and she does deserve as much praise as she's getting but that's because she's a 15. Everyone else is a 10. So she's better but it's ridiculous how awesome everyone else is. Of course Eddie Murphy's great. He's been in those movies where he plays like 10 fat people, which should have gotten him some recognition all these years, but of course they wouldn't go for that. But now that he's done such a great job here whatever awards he'll get, he'll deserve. And those of us who loved 'Party All the Time' are definitely not surprised at his vocal prowess. Jamie Foxx is great again you know, but this time he's playing the villain so maybe that's why he's kinda been ignored. Anika Noni Rose. I don't know where she came from but I loved her too. All great voices. All great performances.Beyonce. Okay, I'm not a huge fan. She's talented and I appreciated her acting from Austin Powers. Yeah that sounds weird but you could tell she was comfortable on screen and had a lot of fun. I don't generally like the way she and her contemporaries sing nowadays so I wasn't expecting much either way. I figured she'd be passable. But she did such a great job playing Diana Ross. Everything down to the gestures, and the fact that she wanted to lose weight for this, tells me that she definitely took her job seriously. And it paid off.I think this is rated PG13. I can't remember why. I think there are a few bad words and one quick flash of some drugs. But I wouldn't mind taking a kid to this. Because there is so much more to it that's worth it. In a strange way I thought it would make a great double feature with Happy Feet. So much toe-tapping to be done. People waited in my theater through the credits for Jennifer Hudson's name/image to pop up and they all clapped. That never happens where I live either. Never. And there were little old ladies going 'WOOHOO!' after a couple of Effie's songs.If you like movies, this year go see everything. But make sure that you save time for this one. You're gonna love it.",10,43,68,13 January 2007
Quantum of Solace," Emo Bond
","I wasn't very impressed with this Bond film. The action sequences were alright. But looking back I think 'Get Smart' had more impressive action sequences. The story was, well, I'm not even sure what the story was. I could barely hear the dialogue and I'm not sure if it was my theater but I did hear all the punches and glass breaking just fine. It seems it was about oil or something, but then not really. I dunno. I'm not sure that the plot really matters much in most Bond films so that's not that big a deal but what really bothered me was how much the focus was not on Bond. I mean it almost seemed at one point that the whole film was revolving around the Bond girl getting revenge. Why in God's name should I care who did what to some Bond girl's relative? And why would I give a rat's patootie if she get's revenge or not? And I'm sorry but why was I watching an old lady take off her makeup and draw a bath? Who cares about that? I want gadgets, menacing bad guys, actiony action. It was pretty much missing here. There was one guy who was prominently portrayed in a photo Bond was carrying around who was on screen for about 2 minutes, and I'm not really sure that he said anything, but he was hot. I would have liked to have seen more of him and exactly what happened to him. But no, our villain was the guy from 'Diving Bell and the Butterfly' and the action sequences in that film were almost as good and numerous as the ones here.I really don't know why I'm giving this a 6/10. It's probably worse than that, but I like Daniel Craig and I guess for most of it I stopped paying attention and daydreamed a better Bond movie starring Mr. Craig and myself. ;) By all means, see it yourself, especially if you're a Bond fan but I didn't like it. For the record, I liked 'Casino Royale' quite a bit but I didn't enjoy the Eva Green business either. But in that case the rest of the movie was good enough to balance out all the girl power. Not this time.",6,1,3,14 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Movie for Old Ladies
","There were 3 old ladies in front of me at the showing I attended. I had to tell them to shut up twice and they couldn't seem to stomach the scenes with people attending to and giving other people wounds. So if you're an old lady, stay home for the sake of your fellow movie fans.Somehow I was still able to focus on what I consider to be one of the best films of this year. I'm a fan of the Coen brothers work. I think most of us are. I think this is one of their best films and the thing is they've only got a couple bad ones, otherwise everything is excellent. This one is part 'Blood Simple' and part 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and a pinch of 'Raising Arizona'. But also it's completely new and very much it's own movie.What we have here is a bad guy, a truly bad dude, played by Javier Bardem, who is also a type of hybrid. Half Michael Myers and half Leonard Smalls. Honestly if someone cut my hair like that I might turn out like that too. But Mr. Bardem does a great job playing this psycho, who is compelled to be exactly the way he is. I could get into what I think his motivations are but I'm not into spoiling things.Josh Brolin is having a great year. He is the star of this film and you find yourself rooting for him, but I'm not exactly sure why. He's no boy scout either. He gets himself into a whole mess of trouble and most of this movie is spent seeing how he will get out of it.Tommy Lee Jones does the best acting I think I've seen him do. He plays the local law enforcement and seems just gobsmacked by how quickly the world around him is advancing in the wrong direction. He sees the big picture in all of this when most people would probably just look at this as a case of one crime and one psycho. I expect an Oscar nomination for Jones at least.Then there is Kelly McDonald who I thought did a great job playing Brolin's wife. I think she should also be recognized mainly for one scene late in the film. She's Scottish and you'd never know it watching this.The Coen brothers have created a classic film here. The reason I say that is that apart from having an overall story and movie that is outstanding, in my opinion, to have a classic film you have to have iconic scenes. There are two scenes that as a movie fan I was very impressed with and that are going to stay with me for a while. One comes early in the film when Josh Brolin his being pursued aggressively. Another comes toward the middle in a tension-filled showdown, where the audience has to read the signs of what's happening and what decisions should be made moment to moment as if you're going through it yourself. At least I felt that way. And this film is full of subtlety, which is why it reminds me of 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. That film was so deliberate and really beautiful and I believe they've gone one step further with 'No Country for Old Men'. This has great acting, it's suspenseful and even thought-provoking.I would suggest this film for people who can handle some violent scenes and who can sit still and really pay attention for a couple of hours. If you can, you shall be rewarded.",10,1,8,30 November 2007
The Love Guru," I really enjoyed it
","I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I've seen that it's getting bad reviews and I don't know why.Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka ('The Love Guru') who is always playing second fiddle to Deepak Chopra. So in an attempt to get the recognition he seeks he takes on the task of helping the star of the Toronto Maple Leafs, played by Romany Malco, whose personal problems are effecting his game during the championships.So the film mixes the kind of advice you'd get in all the self-help books from people like Deepak Chopra with jokes. So it's kinda making fun of it, but it isn't because it shows that the advice is pretty good, but it's still funny. I'm actually someone who has read a lot of those books and maybe you have to be to get how hilarious Guru Pitka is. But he's also Mike Myers and if you don't like Myers, you should probably know that by now, and shouldn't be seeing this movie. If you do like him however, I can't see a real reason why you wouldn't like it. Justin Timberlake has a small role as the opposing goalie, who is causing a great deal of Romany Malco's character's stress. Timberlake's sorta funny but kinda overdid it.The film has some bathroom humor but not as much as you normally see in a Mike Myers film. It's much more about self-esteem and overcoming your baggage in order to succeed. I know it's a silly comedy but that stuff is in there. I guess people wouldn't want to take kids to it, because of some sexual humor, but otherwise I thought it was really funny and laughed throughout.",8,13,26,20 June 2008
Mamma Mia!," Not an original bone in it's body
","This movie is an incredibly loud and obnoxious mash up of movies like 'Les Comperes' and 'Ginger and Cinnamon'. Those movies are annoying enough but to combine their strengths is dangerous for humankind. When this movie was coming out I knew it would be huge. It would have to be the worst movie ever created to undo the goodwill of ABBA. It's not that, but it's not good either. Props to Meryl for showing up and still doing her job without retching the whole time. I've heard loads about how bad Pierce Brosnan's singing was but I could deal with it, he's no worse than Gerard Butler. But the lead girl, although not tone deaf, her voice sounds to me like nails on a chalkboard. Otherwise you have good actors having fun.I can only imagine what the people who paid theater prices to see this on the stage must have thought. At least a movie ticket isn't that much money. I'll clue you in to a better way to spend your money. I bought the CD of ABBA Gold about 15 years ago for probably about $13. It still plays like the day I bought it and I've listened to it a million times. If you have the CD and haven't seen this yet, just listen to that instead. If you've seen the movie and love it, do yourself a favor and purchase some real ABBA.",Null,3,4,28 January 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," It turned out pretty good.
","I liked Bryan Singer before I knew he'd be doing the X-men movies and I really enjoyed what he did with them, especially X2. I think he's a great director. Brett Ratner not so much. And when I heard he'd be taking over for X3 I thought that was pretty bad news. Well he did okay. I mean there are definitely style differences but all in all he got the job done.I like the X-men. I never really read comic books. But I watched the Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. This movie I actually thought was more like those cartoons than the first two films. This was basically an action movie. The dialogue was sort of stilted because it was just meant to get the most basic of information in between action scenes. That's fine. Everything doesn't have to be Shakespeare. I know where all the complaints come in and I'm going to address those with massive spoilers.The deaths. A lot of complaints have been going around about the deaths in this movie and what the cure did and didn't do but I don't understand why. What was done in this film creates no irreparable damage. Is Scott dead? I don't know I never saw a body. Xavier was kinda dead but not really. Jean Grey might be dead but is the Phoenix? Magneto wasn't entirely cured, which Rogue may not have been either. The scene with Beast and the cure kid, forgot who he was, showed that the minute he got away from him his Beastness came back. Well maybe that means that the cure doesn't last for very long. So whether you like what happened in this movie or not X4 could just reset the whole thing.There were some things in the movie I didn't get at first, but then when you think about it for a minute it does make sense.One example is why Jean looked like a corpse but then I realized she sort of was one. And the Sentinels only being heads in the Danger Room seemed to bother some but I mean they can always come back later. I think the problem is the title of this movie. It's making everyone think it's the last movie when once you see it it really doesn't seem that way. So if you think of everything that happens in this as something in the middle of a series it won't seem as serious as the events of the 'last' X-men movie.Other than that I thought the movie was pretty good, the acting wasn't that great and I'm going to guess that it had to do with the change in direction. It was a short movie and it was entertaining but it's no character study. The action sequences are pretty cool. I don't even know why Wolverine starts with Magneto. But I really like the scene with him and Jean at the end. I thought the Juggernaut/Kitty Pride thing was cute. Um, Storm will the eyeballs and the spinning reminded me of Linda Blair a little bit. Beast I liked a lot. I never would have picked Kelsey Grammar for the role but he was perfect. The story itself was fine. I had no problem with it. Once you have the idea of a cure I think things pretty much had to go the way they did. The same thing could be said for Jean Grey and everything that she did. It really makes sense when you think about it. But their president might be a little worse than ours. I think most people who like the first two movies should like it, but maybe fans of the comic books will be able to find too much fault with it to enjoy it.",7,1,3,26 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," EE is a big improvement
","(spoilers)The Extended Edition of The Two Towers is a vast improvement over the theatrical version. Watching this movie in the theater I was confused a lot of the time. I wasn't sure what was really going on. Having not read the books, I couldn't fill in the gaps that it left in the story. That has pretty much been cleared up for me now. I understand the motivations of the character of Faramir, and his brother Boromir, much better now that they were given a decent backstory in one scene which was only a few minutes. (Why these scenes can't be left in the theatrical release of an already long movie is beyond me.) Merry and Pippin have some fabulous scenes as well that add so much charm to what had been an action movie. Now it's a whole movie. Almost every character benefitted from little extra tidbits that really make a difference. Things that seemed to be overdone like the refugees, Arwen, the wargs, all the stuff that seemed to drag on just kinda goes by unnoticed now because there is so much more in the movie that frames them so it's not really a problem anymore.I didn't 'like' the theatrical version of this movie. I could appreciate the work that went into it, the scope of it, the acting, costume design, all the technical stuff. But it was missing something. Now it's not. 10/10. You should really see this version. If you can't or don't want to buy it, borrow a friend's.Let's just hope that in the future, the studios will realize that movie fans want to see good complete movies even if it takes more than 3 1/2 hours to watch them.",10,0,1,19 November 2003
Across the Universe," Either you're on the bus...
","There are people who hate musicals. Sometimes they go to see a movie like this knowing they'd never like it and then complain about it, misleading people into thinking the movie is bad. If you're one of those people stay home, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow.Julie Taymor has done an outstanding job. Firstly these kids can sing. I'm sick of people announcing a musical and then the people in it are famous people or someone they think will draw a certain crowd and then those people can't sing. Well, she luckily has chosen some great singers for this film. Secondly she did something very interesting. She mixes in regular history, with Beatles history and the stories within the songs. If you're familiar with the Beatles catalog as most of us should be, you find yourself guessing the next song based on the context. And then you hear the first few notes and you think 'Perfect!' And then comes the part where you give up trying not to sing along. Yeah I did, and after a while I'm fairly certain I heard the person across the aisle doing the same.I didn't totally get into it right away. It took 'Come Together' to really draw me into it, and I'll admit that's my favorite Beatles song, so maybe that's why, but this version of it (and I adore the Future Villain Band version from SPLHCB) is really great. She got some vocal help in addition to the basic cast on that song that really punches it through. And all the cameos are great.I was watching it thinking it should be movie lots of people love. The 'High School Musical' fans should like it provided they're old enough to see a PG-13 movie. That's up to the parentals, since it has a boob, and a few butts, and a couple of funny cigarettes, and some cursing in it. But it's pretty minimal for these days. I think people who lived through the time, who don't hate musicals, should feel like they're taking a trip down memory lane. And there is a really collective memory vibe to it. (But I wasn't even born then, which is weird.) If you've seen a few movies, you'll probably be reminded of 'Hair' and of course 'Sgt. Pepper's' but this movie is a truly well made film and really the story is wrapped together so well, I guess it's like 'Shakespeare in Love' in that way. Check it out if you don't mind seeing art.",9,1,3,26 October 2007
I Am Legend," Pointless remake #257
","I was dragged to this movie, but I did give it a chance. However there is nothing new here if you have seen 'The Omega Man'. Now 'The Omega Man' was a very cool (in a 70s kitsch way) remake of 'The Last Man on Earth' the very cool Vincent Price movie. Those two movies were different enough that I'm not sure I even realized that 'The Omega Man' was a remake initially. In this case however 'I Am Legend' adds very little, and if you've seen 'The Omega Man', I don't think there is enough to keep you from being bored senseless. What they've basically done is taken that film, added the fast zombies now that '28 Days Later' invented them, and added more backstory about Robert Neville and the virus. But it's minuscule. Some of the effects were pretty good and that's what I'm giving it 3 points for. Someone worked hard on those I'm sure. Otherwise, Will Smith should really focus on more actory movies, because he's good at it and stuff like this is just a waste of his talent.",3,3,8,15 December 2007
The Illusionist," Overdone
","It's impossible not to compare this film to The Prestige. In my comment for that film I said that it reminded me of The Usual Suspects in a way, which was a good thing since that is one of my favorite films. So when I finally got around to seeing The Illusionist today, I was sort of stunned to see that this movie was actually trying to be like The Usual Suspects. I wish I could split-screen Chazz Palmintieri and Paul Giamatti's final scenes just to prove it to you.This movie was okay. The acting was overdone at times. The plot was pretty obvious. Where Suspects left clues you didn't know were clues, the Illusionist leaves honking blatant clues. A blinking red arrow would have only been a little less subtle. I actually wonder how I would have felt about this movie if I hadn't seen The Prestige first. I didn't actually think they'd be as similar as they were in terms of the plot. It's interesting because in both cases you have a vendetta of sorts based around a woman. Here it's romantic silliness, there it's a battle of wills. And also in both films you have two great actors squaring off, but in that one you were blown away by the charisma duel between Bale and Jackman. Here you kinda realize that Giamatti and Norton are much better at being average Joes. They're not so flashy and neither is this film. I enjoy flashy films, maybe if you don't, you'll like this one better.Having said all that it's not really bad. I don't think it should be avoided by any means. And if you like illusions I'd suggest seeing both films and deciding which you like better. I do think years from now The Prestige will be the 'classic' and The Illusionist will be 'the other one'.",7,0,0,10 July 2007
Big Fish," Steve Buscemi rules the world
","I saw Big Fish a few days ago and I'm still thinking about it especially Steve Buscemi. (spoilers) There is one scene in particular where everyone in Spectre is dancing. And he's running behind the mayor and it's more of the quirky awesomeness that we've all come to know as Steve Buscemi. It's why we love him and it keeps popping back into my head and making me smile. The man doesn't get enough praise and we should all tell him how much we love him more often. I love you, Steve. :)As for the rest of the movie, I actually thought everyone was perfect. The casting, itself, was perfect. No one was over the top. The story was such that it really could have been silly but it turned out totally believeable. Tim Burton has done a great job, again. This movie is why we go to the movies in the first place. In a year full of the fantastic, Big Fish has carved out it's own very special place. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had an imagination. 9/10",9,0,0,15 January 2004
The Dark Knight," If the votes went up to 11, I'd give this movie a 100
","Somehow you knew seeing the trailers that this movie could possibly be one of the best ever but you tell yourself, 'Nah, you're just buying the hype.' Well it's better than it's hype and when nominating movies for best-movies-of-all-time lists you have to let it cool for a while, but I wouldn't be surprised if this went down in history as one of the big ones.We'd all heard that Heath was amazing in this and it's absolutely true. It wasn't like he was acting. It was like the Joker was leaking out of his pores. Because not only was he absolutely this character, but the character he created is in itself a masterpiece. Of course you have to also give credit to the Nolans who wrote the character. The way that this written character and this actor came together to create a whole other kind of being will have to be explained scientifically someday. And I'm sure I won't even understand the explanation because it's close to something I stopped believing in a long time ago, and that's magic. They caught lightning in a bottle if you will. You'll have to see it to believe it.But here's the problem with a performance like this, it can blow the other actors out of the water. But in an amazing feat by the entire cast, no one is left out to dry. Everyone is tip-top. And one of my favorite actors, Aaron Eckhart, does such wonderful work in this. It's almost sad that he won't get more attention for it because the focus is on Heath, but I'm sure eventually everyone will come around. Harvey Dent goes through so much. I can't explain further without spoiling, but Eckhart went through a full range of emotion in this film. There is a scene with him and Heath that is already one of my favorite scenes ever. Remember the restaurant scene in 'Heat'? Well, it's kid stuff compared to this one. That's right, I said it.Now let me say something about Christian Bale. I think he may possibly be the best actor of his generation. And in this film he allows everyone else to take the shine. Don't get me wrong. He does the work and does it well but some other actors might be threatened and you'd notice some histrionics to garner the spotlight, especially when they're the title character, but not Bale. His slow and steady Batman was like the rock holding everything in place. Like Alfred is to Bruce Wayne, Bale was to his other actors.Assembling such an outstanding cast, writing such an intricate film, and directing the whole thing is Christopher Nolan, who is now officially one of my favorite directors. I loved 'The Prestige'. On repeated viewings, it still knocks me on my butt. I was shocked at how high I had to include that film on my all time favorites list (yes I keep a list). Usually it takes me a while to bump something up out of respect to the other films but I thought it was brilliant and couldn't help myself. Well, I'm not even going to attempt to crack open my list for 'The Dark Knight' for a while. I fear for my top ten. The imagery, the music, costume design are all perfect. I mean there had to be something wrong with it right? I did have one complaint. But realizing that the plot point in question may not be what it seems, means I can't even complain about that. What I think happened may have not happened and even if it did then it's just a matter of preference and doesn't have anything to do with how insanely stupendous and awe-inspiringly magnificent 'The Dark Knight' is.Who shouldn't see this movie? People with no senses. Maybe that one guy or gal you hate, so they won't get to enjoy such a gift. It's been 5 days since the first time I saw it, 1 since the second and I haven't stopped talking about it. I can't stop saying words like 'best' and 'ever' and 'amazing'. I'm going to wish as hard as I can that the Academy will decide that they need an award for Best Cast this year before it's too late. It's early but I'm hoping this at least gets a Best Picture nomination. If you haven't seen it yet, I'd like to see a doctor's note.",10,4,9,22 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Too slow. Too short. Too dark.
","I was very disappointed with this movie. I haven't read the book since it first came out so I'm not exactly sure how much was missing but either way this movie left a lot to be desired.The books are long and major chunks have to be taken out to fit as much as possible in but this movie had the strange feeling of being stretched out. There were times when even the characters seemed to be talking in slow motion. There should have been more jammed into this especially scenes with Snape and Harry. Those occlumency lessons were some of my favorite 'scenes' in the entire series of books so for it to whiz by the way it did when other scenes dragged on is very strange, especially since the movie could have been and probably should have been longer. And what was there you could barely see. It was soooooooo dark. I have no problem with dark and atmospheric films but this was dark just for the sake of being dark. Hogwarts even looked dingy and in need of a wash. I'm guessing that they hired a little known director that they could bully into making a truncated and ugly film, because he's just be happy to have the job. I'm guessing they told him to make it dark so that they could fudge the special effects. It's not just a case of being spoiled by the previous directors because, in my opinion, this was bad even for a newbie director.The acting was pretty bad from almost everyone, save Staunton and perhaps Radcliffe. And honestly this party didn't get started until you-know-who showed up and you can guess when that was. So basically this movie had a killer ten minutes. But that's it. The one thing that improved from the book was the death of one of the characters. Because in the book it's kinda confusing and the way it was handled here, through special effects, made it more definite. In fact I guess I'm left with the feeling that this movie was made more as a set up for the next film, instead of as a stand alone film. I fear for the next film, and what's worse is that I didn't enjoy the events of Half Blood Prince. So enjoying the book for Order of the Phoenix so much and having the movie turn out this way doesn't bode well. I don't know if kids will like it. They've read the book and depending on how they feel about the omissions might make all the difference. The parents who go with them might be confused and bored. I saw way to many cell phones being used to check the time. But there was one funny moment in my theater. When Fudge finally admits that someone is back the whole crowd said 'Duh!' in unison.I mean you're going to see it, everyone will, just don't expect it to be as good as the last two.",6,0,3,11 July 2007
Blood Diamond," Oh Africa Brave Africa
","Ten points to anyone who gets that reference. I actually thought of that quote in the middle of this movie which I can assure you is not a good sign. I don't know maybe I'm over it. Maybe I'm sick of being informed about problems that are supposed to shock me, because I've gone past shock to 'whatever'. Had the same problem with Babel. Movies like this aren't really that great if you're not emotionally impacted by them and I wasn't.I like Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio and Edward Zwick but somehow this movie fell flat for me. Now the performances of those actors were very good and Zwick is the master of battle scenes. So if that interests you that should make the movie worth your money right there. But there are huge gaps of nothingness in the form of Jennifer Connelly's performance. Homegirl cannot flirt. She's extremely beautiful and very talented but I found out that she is not charming. And this character was obviously meant to be. And what's worse is that she seems to have come down with a severe case of Ally Sheedy Jaw. Now the character was sort of equivalent to Joaquin Phoenix's character in Hotel Rwanda but that character had the sense to leave when he lost his usefulness and did not hog up screen time the way her silly reporter/love interest broad did. Waste of space. I mean she was integral in terms of being part of their plan but the added on BS of the romance angle just stretched it way too thin. I feel bad for saying this but I really feel like this movie would have been greatly improved had her role been cut down or if another actress had played the part.There are a few instances in the film that make you go 'didn't I just see someone do that in another movie?' especially toward the very end when Leo and Djimon become Sam and Frodo climbing Mt. Doom. I know this is a very cynical comment but that's how I felt coming out of this movie. Parts of it are very well made and most of the performances are good but it's got lots of slow points where you drift and you have to force yourself to pay attention especially when Connelly is on screen. So the good scenes get 9s the bad scenes get 5s and you wind up with a 7/10.",7,0,1,14 December 2006
Grindhouse," Looks like I disagree with everybody
","I did think one film was much better than the other but I thought that the good one was Death Proof. And I'd really like it if these two would go to their own corners and make their own movies. This joined at the hip thing is getting old.First problem, Rose McGowan can't act. Really pretty, can't act. Second problem, it's the same thing with Sydney Poitier. Now I know what you're going to say. It shouldn't matter. These movies are in effect spoofs of bad movies from genres that were better off dead. So they should have bad acting in them. Not exactly. You need to be able to act in order to act badly in a movie that is winking at you about how bad it is. Let's separate the two movies.Planet Terror. I feel like it's a take it or leave it movie. I could have lived my whole life without seeing it and I would have been fine. Here you have a situation where the two leads, Freddy Rodriguez and Ms. McGowan are the least talented actors in the cast. Then you have a cheesy zombie movie that isn't cheesy enough. Why? Because it's not taking itself seriously. That's what made B movies so great. They really meant it. That's why it was so funny. The best work in this was from Shelton, Brolin and Biehn. And if we had stayed with those characters it probably would have been a more entertaining movie. I'm not really sure what purpose El Wray served and that was purposefully done. You see there are missing reels. Isn't that clever? I'm sorry but I think they're laughing at the fans with that. I know it's supposed to be the point but if those missing reels show up on the DVD, I'm right. So you lose interest in Planet Terror because it's boring and because you don't know what's going on. And then the ending was too over the top. B movies were B movies because they had welfare budgets and crappy directors. You could make a movie in that style without making a bad one. Actually for most of Planet Terror I sat there wishing I was watching Machete instead.Death Proof. Started off slow because again it had Miss Thing and Miss Thang in it. Well at least we have further proof that acting talent is not hereditary. Okay, once they're dead, YAY!, Death Proof actually becomes good. I saw it as proof that this collaboration needs to stop now. Quentin is so much the better director that it can't help but be a lopsided movie. Now I think the reason everyone else likes Planet Terror better is because that movie had them in a certain mind-frame. Death Proof is completely different. It's much slower, obviously with lots of dialogue. You don't have to pay attention but your brain does have a hard time adjusting to the fact that people are no longer talking in fragments. So when the second movie starts you're probably not in the mood for that sort of thing. Kurt Russell does a great job as a demented former stunt man. He goes on a reckoning of some sort, don't know why, maybe it was in the missing reel. And I personally was rooting for his character although you weren't supposed to. Rosario Dawson was very good as usual and the other women who I don't know, I guess they really were stunt women, also did fine. And I normally hate car chases. I usually go potty or mentally check out when they happen but that was the whole point of this movie. And I found it completely interesting. I also loved the obnoxious bright red blood. That still gets to me about those old movies. The end was abrupt as it should be and even though it wasn't quite the ending I wanted it still was appropriate for what it was meant to be.This is nothing anyone but the most die-hard fans of these guys or Grindhouse cinema need to see. Planet Terror is gross so if you have a problem with that I can't imagine you'd be considering this anyway. It gets a 5/10. Death Proof is a great chase movie with good performances from Rosario and Kurt. It gets a 7/10. Having said all that this is probably Tarantino's worst and middle of the road Rodriguez. See what I mean about QT being that much better? Maybe he should have done the Werewolf Women movie. And, by the way, I think Eli Roth needs to talk to someone.",6,5,12,6 April 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Waste
","That's all this movie was and all it was about. I had heard about this movie for a long time. That it was supposed to be the most something. Can't remember what, but it was always in the back of my mind as a title I needed to see as a movie fan. But it's worthless. I watched it, sat all the way through it, and I have no idea what for.I can't imagine why someone would want to make this film. I see no message in it. It isn't atmospheric, or pretty to look at, there isn't any decent acting and most of the time you're just watching some overly painted face tell a disgusting story. The torture scenes, if you actually put them together would amount to about 15 minutes of the film, the rest of it is these inane stories and you waiting for something to happen. Half of the 'torture' happens at a distance so you can't really see what's going on anyway and the other half is people eating something they shouldn't be eating and it just makes you wonder why someone would want audiences to sit there and watch that. That's the real torture. The director was the real sadist.I mean take the worst horror movie you've seen and the plot has got to be better than this film. Most horror movies even the bad ones have some message or moral to the story. This one is just trying to convince you that Nazis are the most disgusting people ever by showing you disgusting acts, or better yet the same disgusting act over and over. I mean I really just got aggravated because I had heard about this for so long but it was a complete waste of my time. The only people who would praise it are the type who want to seem sophisticated so they pretend to like everything as if they 'get' some kind of 'art' that only the best and the brightest can understand. Whatever. If you're a film fan who hasn't seen it yet, but thinks you need to, you don't. You can skip it.",1,16,34,12 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Too abbreviated for me, however...
","what did make it to the screen was pretty awesome. I had prepared myself that a lot of the things I loved in this book would be missing when I heard the decision to make it one movie, and under 3 hours at that. I thought it couldn't be done. Well it wasn't exactly, this was basically a 'best of' Goblet of Fire, but even still, it works.Things I loved. The first task in the Triwizard Tournament is one of the best action sequences ever. Honestly. People of my generation who grew up on Star Wars and Indiana Jones should love that as well as the rest of the Triwizard Tournament. But this scene in particular was what movies are about. If producers want to know what will make people leave the comfort of their homes and widescreen TVs to spend too much money on tickets and $7 popcorn, it's this scene. So producers, watch this movie and look for the scene with the dragons and do more of that. I'm a movie buff and I was blown away by it.I was impressed with the effects. I'm just realizing it now but it's the first time I haven't noticed anything that looked iffy. I think I forgot there were effects.The acting was mostly great except for two characters, I really don't want to point out who to make anyone feel bad, but in both cases it was some major overacting.The final task in the Tournament. And you thought 'The Shining' had a scary maze. And for those who have read the book the scene within that scene is awesome. Perfect casting getting Ralph Fiennes. I think it's the first time I'm 100% happy with the casting of any of the HP roles.Some things that weren't so hot. Barty Crouch, Jr. I don't understand how anyone who hasn't read the books understood what was going on with him. But when you have a movie moving that quickly through lots of information it's bound to happen I guess. And speaking of moving through quickly. the opening chapters were condensed into what amounts to a montage. Which makes this a good time for me to bring up the fact that there were no house elves. I love Winky in the book, but considering what Dobby looked like in CoS maybe we were better off. Although I always felt they'd play a part later on down the line, so we'll see if not including their subplot was a good idea or not. I also don't think anyone could tell from watching the movies that the girls from Beauxbatons were anything more than pretty girls. There wasn't any magical attractiveness implied as far as I can remember.As far as everything else goes, it was really good. I can't believe that I got over all of the missing stuff but the big scenes were so terrifically executed that I can't help but let it slide. The score I didn't really notice that much. The costumes were okay, I think in this day and age the girls would have had better prom dresses, but Ron's dress robes were priceless. I think this movie should appeal to those who enjoy action movies as well as Potter fans. It should definitely have a larger audience than the previous three.",9,1,2,18 November 2005
Mystic River," horrible ending
",I haven't seen an ending this bad in a long time. This should have been a good movie and 2/3 of the way through it was. But the ending just went completely berserk. You spend two hours building characters so that they can change on a dime? What happens at the end makes absolutely no sense. I can only assume that the people who are calling this a masterpiece either left very early or were mistakenly watching Kill Bill.I can't even explain what happened or how that many talented people wouldn't notice that they were veering off course. I feel like the cast were betrayed by this wacky ending. I would actually give the first part of the movie a 9 but then ending a 5. So it's a 7/10 for me. It's a shame. And the worst part is it probably will win a lot of awards since hype is all you need to get praise nowadays.,7,1,2,16 October 2003
The Departed," If you are a movie fan at all you have to see this movie
","I am not a Martin Scorsese fan, not at all, so I'm surprised to be here telling you that I really liked this movie. Let's get a few things out of the way first. I can't stand Matt Damon. So I'm pretty much going to leave him out of this review. Leonardo DiCaprio, I've thought has been underrated for a long time even with the praise he's gotten recently. I thought he was one of the best actors out there going into this movie. Also, I didn't get to see 'Infernal Affairs'. I meant to and when I can get my hands on an undubbed copy I will.DiCaprio definitely did not disappoint and acting-wise I think he basically wipes the floor with the rest of the cast. This is no diss on Jack, because Jack is Jack. He can walk on water basically but in the scenes with them together as a movie fan you think to yourself 'is Leo going to be able to handle it?' and somewhere in the middle of the scene you realize he's the one commanding it. Really if you are a fan of movies at all you have to see this, for the performances alone. Some of the accents were a little iffy but that's to be expected. I mean everyone here does good work but you can sell repeat tickets on the scenes with Jack and Leo. Think Pacino/DeNiro in the movie 'Heat' but better and more often.The movie is about Boston cops trying to take down a titan of the underworld. Nothing new here, but the story has, not twists but, double crosses and synchronistic incidents that baffle without being contrived or remotely ridiculous. I can't imagine any crime fan not enjoying this movie and wanting to see it again right away. I'm not going to go into the plot anymore because you need to see it. But with all that it's not confusing, or every critics' favorite word lately, incoherent. You know who's who and what's what the whole time. You are completely on the edge of your seat and some things are predictable but it's the stuff that you don't want to happen. So you sit there with your stomach in knots hoping it doesn't. Is it violent? Of course, but it's nothing we haven't seen especially from Scorsese. Actually the scene that for me was the most excruciating to watch involved no blood at all.A few minor complaints. I don't understand Martin Scorsese's use of music. It seems like he likes to drown out his dialogue, and then using the same songs repeatedly, I mean, who does that? And I'm a hater of remakes so I have to take one point off for that. Some old ladies coming out of the theater complained that there was too much unnecessary swearing, but really, consider the source.Now back to the guy I don't like. The reason I don't like him is the same reason that I thought this was perfect casting. I kept hoping and hoping for other actors to take a swing at him. And I can tell you that this was the most fulfilling thing about the movie for me. I felt vindicated because someone saw what I've seen in him all this time to cast him in this role. And I got to see people I like much better beat him up a little bit. I may just by the DVD for that reason alone.So I'm thinking this will get nominated for Best Picture. I personally would like Leo to win a cumulative Oscar with this one. I'm thinking the Scorsese fans might finally get their win in the Best Director category. And if they do, I'm cool with it. This was his best in my opinion since Taxi Driver.edit: I have seen Infernal Affairs now and I thought they were equally good and different enough that The Departed still deserves the praise it's received.",9,1,4,7 October 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Whitaker was Supporting
","I can't believe I never heard any controversy about that. His role was clearly a supporting role in the film. I would have complained during Oscar time but the film wasn't released near me so I didn't see until now. But anyway... I thought the film was great. And not just for his performance which was great but also slightly overrated. James McAvoy did a wonderful job too and I don't think I heard anything about his performance. Sometimes I wonder how much viewers take into a movie about a well known figure and then give the movie or performance credit for their own memories. Because I don't know this Amin guy. I was a little kid at the time. So I didn't have anything to hold him up against. But I'm thinking McAvoy maybe got ignored a little because of that. About the story itself what I found interesting was how similar the two characters were. I don't think either of them wanted to be defined by where they came from. Garrigan wanted to be Scottish but not British which got him into trouble, and I don't think Amin wanted to be like his fellow villagers which seemed obvious in the torture scene. And speaking of that, I thought this movie was grosser than Hostel. I'm sick of horror movies getting discarded out of hand because they have violent images and then seeing a movie with even more violent images that you never hear about. This movie has two insanely disturbing scenes in it. If you're at all squeamish, prepare yourself.I thought the film was really great. It has the suspense of a thriller but Oscar caliber performances too. I probably would have given it a 10 if I was more of a fan of politics.",9,2,3,15 August 2007
August Rush," Better than expected
","Firstly, being a fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers I had been hearing about this project for a while and I couldn't figure out how they'd make sense out of it. It does end up making sense even if it's a little far-fetched. It's about a son and his parents who all have to find each other, but my problem was that I couldn't figure out a way they could have gotten so separated in the first place. But luckily the writers did. It's pretty sappy and sentimental but if you're not that kind of person, I can't imagine you'd be interested in something like this anyway. It's the type of story that always comes out around this time of year, which is also the most sentimental time of the year. It gives you warm fuzzies so if you like something like 'Mr. Holland's Opus' or 'About a Boy' or 'Love Actually' you'd more than likely enjoy it.I don't know if this qualifies as a musical but it should. It had lots of music in it although people didn't burst into fits of singing dialogue. The songs were normal songs, mostly original, and they were great. The young people involved were very talented, especially Jamia Simone Nash and Leon G. Thomas. Robin Willams and Terrence Howard had smaller supporting roles. (I've been saying that Williams and Bono resemble each other for 20 years so I'm glad he put the hat on and finally proved me right.) JRM and Keri Russell are co-stars who do their jobs well. But the star of the movie is Freddie Highmore. He's a good actor and I believe this was the first thing I've seen him in. I wouldn't be surprised to see him nominated for this.I actually think this movie would be good for kids. I think there is maybe one bad word in it and maybe the way he came into the world might bother the extreme conservatives. But it's uplifting and a story about belief, especially belief in yourself. And I expect that'd be good for anyone to see, except maybe those who really hate too much sentimentality.",9,66,89,24 November 2007
American Gangster," Very good but...
","I don't think that's good enough. There were a lot of extremely talented people on this project so the fact that it's just a very good movie is kinda disappointing to me. A lot of it was typical. Typical story told in a typical style with typical acting. And mostly I mean Denzel Washington. Very early in this film I though 'you know Samuel L. Jackson would have been better in this'. In my opinion, he's not only a better actor, but he also doesn't play himself all the time. I know this isn't a popular opinion but I think Denzel plays himself most of the time. Role to role it's Denzel, looking like Denzel, playing Denzel in a very Denzelly way. So I kinda wish another actor had had the lead here (even if it was Chewitel Ejiofor who seems to be making a career as the guy who walks slightly behind and to the left of Denzel) and at some point I just wanted them to get back to the scenes with Russell Crowe.As luck would have it, I saw a History Channel program last night called 'Gangland' that focused on Frank Lucas. So I basically had a primer for this movie and it seems fairly accurate from what I could tell. So any comparisons to other films would have to do with style because it's not a ripoff of anything. Other movies it might remind you of are Blow, Scarface, Heat, Serpico, Donnie Brasco, etc. It almost makes you wonder how Al Pacino wasn't in it, but those movies were better in my opinion probably because of the way the stories were told. This was a basic story about a drug dealer who eventually gets caught. He's mean, he goes to Vietnam, he's still mean, he works with dirty cops, he's mean... You never really get any motivations or psychological reasons why he became who he did. He just did. I think that made the Roberts characters more interesting. Maybe he was just a more interesting person in real life I don't know, but even the background stuff with his family just seemed tacked on. I guess I expected more from these people. I think some of the supporting cast was great but then they had a few rappers in there. And I'm sorry but that bugs me. Please no more rappers. I go to a movie to see actors pretend to be hoods not real life hoods.I don't know. I guess a lot of little things got to me in this film. But it not really bad. It's just that it's nothing new. Nothing profound. Nothing mind-blowing. Nothing amazing to look at. If someone asked me what movie they should see and they were thinking about this one but weren't sure, I'd send them to Gone Baby Gone. At one point I started to wonder what someone from New York like Brian De Palma or Spike Lee would have done with the same story and I imagined it being a lot better. But again, it's not bad. It just should have been better. If you're a fan of these guys by all means see it. I don't want to deter anyone who is really interested. It may be your favorite movie of the year. It just didn't live up to my expectations.",8,0,5,2 November 2007
Ray," Hit the Road, Jack!
","Yes, that's the title of one of Ray Charles biggest hits, but it's also what Jamie Foxx will be telling his fellow nominees on Oscar night. And for years we've being seeing people win for the wrong role (i.e. they should have won previously) or for political reasons, but finally someone will actually deserve it. I realize that the Academy could do something really stupid and give it to someone else, but then they'd have to realize that no one will ever take them seriously again. On top of the glorious performance by Mr. Foxx, this is a well crafted film. I like biopics, and they generally follow the same path. But this is incredibly compelling as a story, which I guess is really no one's fault except Ray Charles himself. He had such an extraordinary life that the film only covered about half of it. That may make it seem like something is missing but this story is really about the internal struggle this amazing person went through. And when that struggle ends the movie ends. So it's not incomplete by any means. (Although I do hope there is an extended edition on DVD one day :) ) There is so much I didn't know about Ray Charles. I'm only 30, so basically I knew him from TV appearances and hearing him sing 'America the Beautiful' at various events. I didn't have any idea about his personal life and how much life he did live. I don't think I had realized how many hits he had either. I knew he was a huge presence on the music scene, but not that huge. And interestingly enough his story is presented in such a way that if it had been story about a fictional character it would still be totally absorbing. So Hackford should be commended as well, especially for the honesty that is usually lacking in biopics. This isn't a sugar-coated portrayal where they leave out important points because it might upset someone. It's all there for everyone to see. Apart from the transcendent Foxx, the other actors were also fantastic, especially Regina King. I hope she is nominated, as well. The only thing I don't get is why people keep casting Larenz Tate as real people to whom he bears no resemblance. *shrug*Anyone who enjoys movies or music should see Ray. You won't be disappointed. It's well worth the price of admission... and popcorn.. and candy... and a soda. It's that good. 9/10",8,2,3,8 November 2004
Casino Royale," Casino Royale with Cheese
","The cheese being Eva Green, all the stuff with MI6, a trip to Naboo and giving exposition duties to the man with the thickest accent in the cast. If you removed all that nonsense this would be the best Bond movie ever and one of the best action movies ever.I guess I just don't like Eva Green. I disliked her in The Dreamers but thought it might be the character but it wasn't. Imo, she's awful here and I could see that it's the same 'what is that smell?' face that she can't stop making and lack of nuance (that I didn't realize would be a problem with a Bond girl role but it actually is) that puts you off.I don't understand why, if they were going to reboot, they didn't get a new M. Everyone loves Judi Dench. I do too, but this time not only didn't it make sense but she was kinda wooden. Yes, her. I couldn't believe it either. All the MI6 stuff was cringe-worthy.The trip to Naboo. Lake Como is gorgeous, and plenty of areas are used often in film, BUT since it's been such a recognizable setting in a huge film set in a galaxy far far away, I don't think it was wise to go back there so soon. It could have been worse. George Clooney could have been marrying Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the background I suppose.L'uomo d'exposizione. Giancarlo Giannini has a thick accent. Don't have him explain things. What's worse is that everything he explained, was completely obvious. I'm not 3. I can add the money in the pot myself. :p I got the same feeling watching this that I did with Superman Returns. You go into the movie wondering if the new guy is going to be able to fit the suit and he's great, even perfect, but then something obvious like the script or in this case the other actors throws the whole thing off. It's not as bad in Casino Royale, but with both movies you can't help but think, 'If only they'd done this' or 'If only they hadn't done that'. I get the feeling watching most Bond films that they don't care much about the details. I like Daniel Craig. I think he's a really good-looking guy, but somehow they made him look awful, mostly in the scenes at the beginning. But you begin to wonder if they just didn't bother hiring lighting or make-up people. It got better after a while. But there are a couple time when you just go 'Woah!', like when he comes out of the water. Just after the clip you see in the trailer, there is a close up of his face and he looks like a combination of the kid from Mad magazine and Dobby the house elf.But about him as Bond. I really think he's great. I liked him going into this movie and I never really had the concerns everyone else did about whether he could be 007 or not. I think this was definitely more of a rock 'em sock 'em Bond. The opening sequence with Sebastian Foucan(who is this guy? Spider-Man? Insane athleticism.) was the best Bond opener ever. I mean the new one always has to be right? Well I thought it rocked. Imo, you can really see that this movie was made after the Mission Impossible and Bourne movies. I'm hesitant to say it was influenced by them because Bond kinda started it, but yeah. And Craig is very much someone I could see actually being an agent. I think he was also very suave and debonair with the first love interest played by Caterina Morino. I wish she had been the female lead. I don't think there was very good chemistry with the other one. He's a more sensible, realistic, and of course blonde, but also a darker Bond. In this movie the silly one liners stuck out like a sore thumb, whereas in most Bond films they fit right in.There was awesome chemistry with the main villain, Le Chiffre played to perfection by Mads Mikkelsen. I'm willing to put him on my short list of Bond villains, with 006 and Scaramanga. All the James Bond kinda stuff was amazing. The action scenes, the casino scenes, etc., were the best in any Bond film. I really think most people who like Bond movies will enjoy it. And people who like Action but for some reason don't usually go for Bond will have more to like here. Everyone should love Daniel Craig. And I think we'll all be looking forward to the next one to be that much better.p.s. One more complaint. Jeffrey Wright had like 3 lines. Don't do that. He's one of the best actors working today.p.p.s Who was that gorgeous Asian man at the poker table? He needs to be in like 10 movies, stat.",8,0,2,17 November 2006
Get Him to the Greek," Liked it but not what I expected
","Firstly, I love Russell Brand. Secondly, I have seen but pretty much hated My Favorite Year. I thought this was going to be the same thing. It is and then it isn't. It's not as much of a comedy to be honest. And they totally sell it as a comedy, which they do with all Apatow movies and I don't know why. Forgetting Sarah Marshall to me was barely a comedy because it's about a guy who is depressed the whole time. This isn't really that different. Just in this case it's a drug addict rock star who is pretty much headed on the road that many people have taken in recent years and ended up as a breaking news obit at the top of this website. It's another bromance as well, which is fine by me. All these movies are more sentimental than they'd have you believe in the trailers. I personally think that's detrimental to the movie because it makes people expect one thing and get another and then write on the internet how disappointed they are. Problem is, it's not a bad movie. It's actually a good movie about the record industry and people and how they treat each other in such a ridiculous lifestyle with some funny bits thrown in.I love Russell Brand and Jonah Hill together. I think they have the best chemistry. Their scenes together, pretty much the whole film, were more personal than funny. The more comedic parts usually happen when other people enter the mix. P. Diddy, for example, had a much larger role than I expected and he was okay in it. I probably would have cast an actor with more comedy experience, as well as choosing a different rock star cameo for Jackie Q's other love interest. But apart from that I really have no complaints. Perhaps I would have used more of Aldous' songs throughout the film, but that's because I quite like Brand's voice. I don't know that it was necessary for the plot.Other stuff. It's an R for a reason. There's sex humor and drug stuff going on. There are some breasts but not much else in the nudity dept. that I can recall. I guess I'd recommend it for people like me who like English rock stars and comedies with warm fuzzies.",9,1,14,4 June 2010
Happy Feet," Some people either aren't getting the point or hate the point this movie makes
","Look, we are depleting too much of the world's fish. Don't blame the movie for telling the kids about it. The city I live in is a major fishing port, so when I saw the message coming across loud and clear I knew exactly how much it was going to aggravate people. But too bad, it's true. Do you want to know how they kill them because I've been on a fishing boat? Well they reel in the net and as the fish flop on the deck you're supposed to hit them in the head with a stick that has a nail in it. Tell your kids that if you hate propaganda.Anyway, the story is about a misfit penguin who is in serious danger of never finding a soulmate because he can't sing his heart song. He taps it. Well it wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for close-minded people, er, uh, I mean penguins. So he becomes an outcast and finds some friends who aren't like him but they don't have the same rigid standards as his original group. So he learns to believe in himself and at a crucial point in the movie he decides to do the right thing for those who shunned him even if it means certain death. I mean, come on. That's the real message for the kiddies. Self-sacrifice for the greater good. The other message is for us grown-ups. And that message is, we're not the only ones here who have lives to lead and babies to have and songs to sing, or tap. So stop acting like you are. In order to get the message across in the movie Mumble had to get his point across to humans and talking or singing wasn't going to help so he had to find a way to communicate with us. See, bridging gaps, self-sacrifice, the greater good. Who wants that message in a movie right? The voice talent was great. I was surprised how little Jackman and Kidman were in it. Brittany Murphy is awesome. I've been saying this for a long time so now you all know. And well, Elijah Wood never got to sing. I was 100% sure he would by then end. That made me a little sad so I took a point off for that. The animation is top notch. Some real roller-coaster type action sequences. The music was good. You know I might have picked a few better songs myself, but 'Boogie Wonderland' was the only choice for it's intended purpose. I did notice that the smaller kids never really settled down. Someone brought a stroller sized kid and he never stopped crying after some scary stuff and had to be removed. So I guess it isn't really for the wee ones. And in a way I thought the movie would be more enjoyable for adults anyway because the song selections were from our collective mental jukebox. I mean if you hate the environment, and singing and dancing, and cute little furry things then it probably isn't for you. And if you can't tie your own shoes, you might be too young. Otherwise go see it and break out some old-fashioned tappin'.",9,1,4,2 December 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Captain America got me
","After that point it was waterworks for the rest of the movie.Will Smith does a great job as Chris Gardner. A dad who kept getting tripped up in his quest to provide for his son, played by his real life son Jaden. He's a salesman whose product isn't exactly in demand. Things get out of hand for him financially and in trying to get himself out of a bad situation he's in a race against bad luck and the runaway train that is a glimmer of opportunity. Will hasn't been this good since Six Degrees of Separation and Jaden was great as well. Totally natural, not one of those annoying Hollywood kid actors. Thandie Newton I can do without. She overacts.I don't know how much of the story was fudged, if any. It seems just like real life. You can't make up that many bad/good coincidences. It's an uplifting story but not in a cheesy way. It's got a PG-13 rating and I'm going to guess that it's because of the one occurrence of the F word, otherwise I think it's appropriate for anyone. It's another in a great holiday movie season.",9,1,2,16 December 2006
Atonement," I didn't know until the very end
","how much I loved this movie. And I have to say it forced tears out of me quite violently. What a beautiful film.As you can tell from the trailers this story is about the consequences of a misunderstanding. I don't know if people realize how much damage something like this can do. In the movies, it almost never happens. People say and do the right things all the time unless it's funny then wackiness ensues. But in real life it happens all the time. I almost wonder if some people will think that these things don't really happen and that it makes the movie unrealistic just because they're not used to seeing it.Anyway, the film itself is beautiful and there is an incredibly amazing sequence when they get to a beach. It goes on for a few minutes and I really thought that was breathtaking. I don't think I'm familiar with the director but he did some great work. He and the cinematographer, because to look at it, it's just sumptuous. The cast was also amazing. A few different actresses played the young girl at different stages and I don't know if they really look that much alike or if I just bought into it because the movie was so absorbing, but they all did fantastic work. James McAvoy has one of those faces, it's so clear. You can't stop looking at him, kinda the same way you can't stop looking at Al Pacino. He was under-appreciated in 'The Last King of Scotland' so I'm glad to see he's getting some attention for another great role. And Keira Knightley continues to surprise me. Beautiful as she is she could just kick back and do a lot of vanity projects and collect Pirates royalties, but she continues to prove herself as an actress.This movie will be loved by people who love a film like 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'The English Patient'. It's not as long as those but it fits into that epic love story genre. And Zhivago is on my very short list of favorites so I wouldn't say that lightly. There are some graphic scenes but of war wounds. Not the kind of graphic I was expecting. And there is one very bad word in it that becomes somewhat of a focal point. But if you're a mature individual who doesn't mind those things and who enjoys classic film with war and romance then this is most likely for you.",10,5,9,14 December 2007
The Island," Did someone say Sanctuary?
","I knew going in that this movie wasn't going to be original. I have read here and elsewhere about the plot similarities to a movie I haven't seen, but there are a lot of similarities to Logan's Run, a movie that I like very much and I just couldn't get over it. Because there was nothing to help me get over it. Even if you haven't seen those movies there is a 'been there, done that' feeling to this, especially for a SciFi fan like myself. And the rest of it is a lot of exploding car chases, which always makes my mind wander, and a scene we've seen too many times in movies involving clones/identical twins. It goes something like this 'I'm him'; 'No I'm him.'.Now I love the cast, especially Sean Bean. And he'g got a line at the end of this movie that I couldn't believe. I just sat there shaking my head thinking 'no he's not going to say that, no'. Well he did. It's a well known joke by a very popular American comedian and I don't know if it was supposed to be a nod to said comedian, which would be absolutely silly at that point in the film, or if they were just stealing it and trying to turn it into an 'Hasta La Vista, Baby!' type quote. And having to watch him fight Ewan McGregor bothered me because I like both of them and I'm thinking 'Don't hit his face!', then 'NO, don't hit HIS face!!!' :o) If you like the actors in it, they all look really nice. And I can't say I was disappointed because I wasn't expecting much. I don't have a problem with Michael Bay either. I like the look of his films and this is no different. We've just seen better, a lot better, from everyone involved.",5,1,4,23 July 2005
