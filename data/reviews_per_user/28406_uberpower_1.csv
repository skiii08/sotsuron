Mission: Impossible III," Tom Cruise may be crazy, but thats not why the movie sux.
","OK he's crazy but I wanted to see the movie anyway. Loved the other two they were awesome. This movie wasn't horrible because of Tom's crazy alien worship. It was horrible because 1)There was no new action, or what was new was predictable, ie helicopter. 2)NO CHEMISTRY between him and lover. 3) Opening sequence? What opening sequence? 3) the direction was choppy, it was like a long TV episode. 4)Resolution takes all of 3 minutes. OK everythings resolved all at one time. I was very disappointed with this movie. There has been much better in this franchise and with Cruise. There is definitely something 'off' in this movie, and its a crying shame.",4,2,4,22 May 2006
