Black Swan," A film about how a ballerina's life is taken over by her lead role in Swan Lake
","This has to be the best film of the year! A must see for anyone who enjoys a thriller with a sensual side. Plus who wouldn't want to see a film with two of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. Black Swan will keep you on the edge of your seats from beginning to end. While at times the chilling action makes the viewer feel uncomfortable, this is part of what makes this film so great. The juxtaposition of the 'black swan ' character and the 'white swan' was terrifying and brilliant to say the least. This was the film of a lifetime for Natalie Portman, earning her a Golden Globe for Best Actress. She plays the role of Nina Sayers, an up and coming uptight ballerina who takes her dancing too far. She gets the lead role in 'Swan Lake' and must strive to be able to overcome her innocent ways in order to dance the part of the 'black swan'. Mila Kunis' secondary role was also quite impressive as well; her sexy scenes with Natalie were dark and absolutely captivated the audience. This film truly reminds us of how many of us have dual personalities: a dark and an innocent side. However, you must be warned: this movie is very intense, and you must be prepared to leave a bit shaken up.",10,1,3,23 January 2011
