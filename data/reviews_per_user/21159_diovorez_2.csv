The Rock," This movie rocks. (no pun intended)
","If you haven't seen this movie, run to your local video rental place and pick up a copy right now! The Rock is hands down one of the best action movies of this decade.The situation: A Disgruntled General from the marines, Francis X Hummel (played by Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz Island and takes 81 tourists hostage.Sean Connery plays a 60-year-old convict, John Mason, the only man who has ever escaped from The Rock. He reluctantly agrees to lead a Navy Seal team into Alcatraz.Nicolas Cage plays the nerdy but brilliant Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI, a man whose daily life mostly consists of sitting around his desk wasting time. He is assigned to accompany the Navy Seals to the rock, to defuse 15 Guided VX Gas Rockets.This movie not only gives beautiful action sequences, but delivers genious character relationships and drama. Stanley makes a steady transition from being a wimpy nerd to being a 'tough guy.' Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage's scenes of back and forth dialogue are gold.The other thing that makes this movie great is, it's a movie about Alcatraz, yet the producers still found a way to incorporate a spectacular chase scene, including a HumVee a Ferrari, and several cop cars!Did I mention that the movie is produced by the 2 best names in hollywood? Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer are in the commander's seats, making sure this movie didn't stray from excellence.I give it 10 our of 10.",9,2,2,5 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An awesome movie (14-year update)
","Update: It's been 14 years since I was writing this review as a teenager. Rereading it today, I cringe at how forgiving I was of this movie's flaws. I like this movie less and less as I get older and now consider Episode I to be the ultimate cautionary tale of filmmaking. The original review is preserved for nostalgia.Original: -------------------This movie was the perfect addition to the Star Wars saga. Well, it was almost perfect. I agree with what most people have to say: The acting was great, the Special Effects were amazing, and the music was very well done (hats off to John Williams for composing the soundtrack; I fell in love with the song 'Duel of the Fates,' which plays during the light saber battle with Darth Maul.)However, I must be honest: the movie is not perfect. Below, I have listed some points that make it flawed:-While the special effects are great, they use the new style of computer generation, and it doesn't give quite the same feel as how it was done in the old films.-Over half of the characters in the movie are computer generated. Personally, I liked it better when they were all done with people in costumes or puppets.-Queen Amidala's hair styles get more abnormal in every scene.All of these are minor flaws, and didn't affect my overall score. However, there is one other problem:-Jar Jar Binks is in the film. For this reason alone, I must deduct one point off my rating. There is no excuse for an annoying character like that to even have a part in a Star Wars film, and now he's coming back in Episode 2. My only consolation is he is killed or exiled before episode 3 ends, because he is never shown in the later episodes.I give it a 9/10 overall.",3,0,1,9 February 2000
