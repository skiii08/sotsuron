Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thoroughly disappointing, start to finish
","The computer animation was technically amazing, and the choreography of the main fight scene was excellent. Every other element of the film was lacking. The story was poorly conceived, appealing to neither adults nor children. There were about four times in the entire film when a small number of people in the audience half-heartedly semi-laughed. The acting was third-rate, even by some first-rate actors. George Lucas clearly has forgotten how to write or direct a movie, and had the complete 'artistic freedom' to put out a very poorly made film.",2,0,1,11 July 1999
American Pie," Hilarious, not your run-of-the-mill teen sex comedy
","I was expecting the usual fluff, but there were half a dozen times I couldn't hear the dialogue because the audience was laughing so hard. Everyone, from kids still in high school to adults long graduated, enjoyed this film.",9,0,0,11 July 1999
There's Something About Mary," Yes, it's offensive, but it's not even funny.
","Ha, ha, that guy's a retard.  Ha, ha, toilet.  Ha, ha, nudity. Ha, ha, that's really gross.  There -- I've saved you the price of a movie ticket",2,0,0,12 September 1998
