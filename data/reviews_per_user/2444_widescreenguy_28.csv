Walk the Line," 'hello. I'm Johnny Cash' and the cheers would fill the stadium
","I live in the city where purportedly Johnny proposed to June on stage. I cant recollect that, but I do recollect the time he did a show here and heard about an easter fund raising event on the radio called the 'bunny bundle'. so he called in and gave 5,000 dollars. some loser called in after that denigrating it as a 'publicity stunt', so Johnny called back, gave ANOTHER 5 grand and canceled the show.so from that I concluded he was a generous and sensitive man of principles.his Folsom album was the first C&W recording I ever bought. I even learned the lyrics.and then he played Toronto at the ontario place stage before it was torn down. a very intimate setting and you could see how he had aged but still got a great deal of enjoyment from performing, another aspect of his generosity.Jouquin Phoenix matches his voice and mannerisms perfectly, the wavy black hair and the way he would reach around the back part of his guitar and swing it around. and Reese was amazing too, especially doing the singing parts herself.I just picked up the DVD since it has now started to hit the second hand shops.a very outstanding film about the real life experiences of a very outstanding pair of performers.",9,0,0,1 March 2007
3:10 to Yuma," excellent pacing
","this film succeeds on many levels, with much attention to detail: the mundane set decorating which includes laundry hanging over the back alleys, did you ever see that in a john wayne flic? or perhaps in john wayne's world dryers existed in western towns in the 1880s.the best part of this film was how the uncertainty is maintained whether they're going to get the villain Wade onto the train.it was nice to see Peter Fonda but I didn't recognize him at first. gee he's sure changed since 'Easy Rider' ! it has the tension of High Noon, the grittiness of Unforgiven and the workaday realism of 'Lonesome Dove'.superb western. definitely in the top 20. or 10. if you like westerns you will really like this one.",9,2,5,12 January 2008
Monster," chilling
",Charlize Theron very much deserved the Oscar nod for this one. the metamorphosis into and out of this character required is legendary stuff.there is much violence and profanity but that is necessary to establish the mood of this disturbing film. I don't normally watch horror/slasher/ killer/bloody typical Hollywood stuff but this one has the added touch of being based on a true story. I remember the newspaper reports of a female serial killer in florida and this film answers a few of the questions. the disclaimer at the end of the film is informative too.Charlize Theron was exceptional as was Christina Ricci as the other half of a doomed lesbian couple. fortunately the film does not dwell on that aspect more than necessary to contribute to plot development. instead emphasis is placed on the increasing hair trigger temper and downward spin out of control exhibited by the lead role.this is not a film for sensitive or young viewers but is worth viewing.7&1/2 out of 10,Null,0,0,4 June 2004
We Were Soldiers," armchair experts not welcome here
","in 1970 I had no job prospects and not enough grades to go to university. I toyed with the idea of taking a bus to the Detroit recruiting center and go to Viet Nam and try to kill some communists.but the place was a quagmire at that point and those in the know realized it was a lose-lose prospect. the north Vietnamese were willing to pay any price to win and far too many of the south Vietnamese saw the war as a great way to make money on the black market.the most telling thing for me about the movie wasn't even part of it, it was the commentary and interviews included in the DVD, 'they finally got it right'.this film should be required viewing for all the congressional hawks who have vested interests in outfits like halliburton and big oil. who refuse to enlist their *own* kids in the army and instead send the young people from disadvantaged neighborhoods.how can the USA put such an appallingly inept man like George dubya 'Im a war president' in charge when his claim to fame is dodging his responsibilities in the air national reserve? I have immense respect for military fighting personnel but cringe at all the glorification and exclusivity attached to it. a filthy business fraught with collateral casualties as depicted in the movie and as we see still in reports from Evanston.attention to detail puts this film above other fare. realism and emphasis of 'getting it right'.and to blazes with the hollywoodists clicheists who nitpick about things they know NOTHING about.I am immensely glad I never enlisted and instead opted to go back for 1 more year of high school. but if I ever had to serve in combat I would have hoped it would be under leadership of someone like Moore.",8,1,2,27 May 2006

","the story line about random convergence was dealt with well in 'grand canyon' but this takes it to a much higher level.movies rarely give me a lump in the throat.this one did it 3 times. the child protects her daddy, the upper middle class professional finds out her true friend and the other one I leave to your imagination. lots to pick from.the film flips effortlessly between story lines and is just the right time length to get the message across.Mr Haggis is a local hero and I can see why. looking forward to more great entertainment from him.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," m.a.d.: mutually assured destruction
","soviet Russia failed, ultimately, because they simply ran out of money. they could not sustain the arms race which gobbled more than half their GNP every year. the Russians were armed to the gills but finally had little to protect.they were a nation that squandered their valuables on the best safe they could buy, but then didn't have anything left to put in it.thus they come up with the doomsday device but ineptly neglect to tell the rest of the world as pointed out by strangelove. who is a mad genius in the art of warfare, propaganda, and is loyal to the ones who give him the means to pursue his ideals.I've seen this film over 10 times and get the same laughs every time. 'you cant fight in the war room', 'shoot it open you twit thats what the bullets are for' 'purity of essence' 'mine shaft gap'. you see, in an extreme perverse way this is the mindset of those who put us in the position of constant low level fear of nuclear missiles.its the way they get us to fall in line and support them, the bushists are still doing it 'terrorist alert status' because it works !!! some of the roles in the film were tailor made for the actors: Scott, Sellers, Hayden. this is Kubrick's best.I was a teenager in that period and recollect all the hysteria of the Cuban missile crisis, B52s flying training missions over SW Ontario from 20,000' up ( you can tell by the angle of the wings and number of vapor trails, 4 pairs of engines) believe it or not I also recollect sputnik flying over I actually saw the dot of light moving quickly across the sky.all you have to do is a bit of digging to find some American hawks that were perfectly willing to bomb Russia in a first strike as a preventive measure. because of course they might hit us first later if we don't hit them now.nuts. the politicians were all nuts. and if the weapons had developed a wee bit faster for one side or the other, then maybe the impetus for first strike would have been too strong to resist.and the notion that 'maybe' we're lagging a bit in our supply of weapons, therefore we must design and build better ones, is interpreted by the other side in the same vein and when they see the other side gaining an 'edge' in type and number of weapons, they too engage in research and manufacture of more. that was the essence of the arms race, the lingering fear and doubt, the nagging fear maybe the other power was ahead of you so you better acquire an 'insurance' edge fed the frenzy.the film captures the absurdity, fear, technology, simplistic views, male dominance (only 1 woman in the film and she's a floozy) all combined with the usual effect of Murphy's's law.tremendous film. my only 10/10 so far",10,1,2,16 May 2006
Closer," natalie portman shines
","pay close (pun intended) attention to the name Alice gives Larry when he catches up to her in the strip club and then look at the name in her passport when she goes back to New York at the end of the movie.I once hung around with a stripper in thorold ontario, a welland canal town that was a magnet to all the rough edge types. strippers truly have a very hard thick exterior with a tiny very soft fragile inside. at least the one I got to know.if natalie portman ever decides of a career change she certainly has the moves and manner of a professional stripper. I heard the full frontal stuff wound up on the cutting floor. as it should. there was no need to distract from a very powerful film by glimpses of Natalie.I first saw Clive Owen in . . . the one about the casino worker. very impressive here. julia roberts was her usual so-so self. why is that woman so highly rated? jude law really takes the cake as the unlucky-in-love. he could have had it all, a life of devotion and loyalty from a woman who genuinely loves him but, nah, gotta throw it ALL away in fragile masculine ego jealousy.",Null,1,1,21 May 2005
Predator," in my top 5 sci fi list
","I really like the part where arnold slides down the cliffside and into the river and realizes the alien couldn't see him because the mud concealed his infrared profile. this is the point where the aliens weaknesses are first evident, not the fact it bleeds.the movie is graphic in places where the skinned victims bodies are shown but it is necessary to show the level of evil and violence of the alien.I think it is a very good sci fi film and a good action film as well with few minor insignificant plot and technical inconsistencies.and by the way, if you think space aliens are gonna be like 'e.t.' or 'encounters of the 3rd kind' you are very naive. it is just as possible they are bloodthirsty and violent and use technology the way humans use it to breed and slaughter livestock by the millions.technical prowess certainly doesn't guarantee humanitarianism.",6,1,9,1 October 2005
The Aviator," needs more balance but still excellent
","I remember a lot of the press about the very eccentric Howard Hughes and also read a biography on him after he died.the film I think somewhat overemphasized his obsessive compulsive disorder and could have done more about his accomplishments. he was for example a pioneer in pushing for fuselage flush rivets which added immensely to airspeed for any plane.all the actors and actresses handled their roles very well Cate Blanchett although she does not resemble Hepburn in appearance she nailed down the unique voice right to a T. Kate Beckinsale who is proving to be very busy is even more beautiful than the original Ava Gardner.Decaprio is excellent as the movie mogul aviation real estate billionaire. no doubt he has indispensable insight into Hollywood intrigue.the film is about 3 hours and ends rather abruptly. then again, it only shows Hughes until just after the 1947 hearings. I am curious as to whether the filmmakers used transcripts from those hearings. I wouldn't be surprised; a lot of people underestimated Howard Hughes.20th century aviation owes a great deal to the adventurous spirit of Howard Hughes. perhaps we would have had even more rapid advance had he not been periodically put out of commission by ocd (feel free to do a google search on the topic). it was unfortunate for Mr Hughes that he was born too soon to take advantage of a spectrum of serotonin uptake inhibitors that would certainly greatly alleviated his suffering. I know what I'm talking about, I've had the condition since 1973 but it is nowhere remotely as bad as it used to be. I therefore truly sympathize with Howard Hughes; it is only fair that he made billions of dollars considering what he did for civil aviation and a plethora of other engineering fields.see the movie for insight into his life.I find it ironic that a man who had a great deal to do with the advancement of airplane designed passed away in one while it was in flight to the hospital in his home state of Texas.",9,3,6,29 December 2004
Cold Mountain," cold comfort from cold mountain
","the scene of the big explosion at the beginning of the movie actually happened, as did the union slaughter when the soldiers from the north charged into the crater and couldnt get out. such is the stupidity and waste of war. there is a surplus of stupidity and waste in this film too. despite a 3 hour running time and a host of characters there was something missing. a lack of focus. perhaps it was the time and location shifting which is a trademark hollywood technique.I watched the Ken Burns PBS series on the civil war and speak from some authority on the subject. An event so pivotal should have provided background for something more emotionally compelling than a mere vehicle to trot out the much touted Ms Kidman. I did like Renee Zellwegger however. She seems to be as feisty in person as the character Ruby in this movie.so it seems the hollywood forte of creating fiction extends to creating hype about the fiction they create; to whit I recall the oscar night splash regarding Cold Mountain. a film that tries to be too many things: an anti-war statement, a love story, a human interest story. and doesnt quite make the grade on any count.a very watchable film, worth a first look, but somewhat disappointing considering the expectations that preceded its release on dvd.6 1/2 /10",Null,0,1,3 July 2004
Saving Private Ryan," realism quotient right off the scale
","thats right.many nitpickers claim the film is not realistic; clearly they have no experience with the countless detours, ad hoc actions, revised plans, FUBAR situations and the like that is part and parcel in the ebb and flow of combat.the business about Capt Miller's comment about 'the Germans having to change the barrel of their machine gun and this is the chance to attack' in the radar station scene is nitpicked by some based on their knowledge of German weaponry.well big fcukin deal, like no soldier ever made a mistake assessing the enemy's armaments? the scene simply ADDS to the realism, not subtracts from it.This is a benchmark war film which I have seen probably more than a dozen times. I have the D-Day commemorative version. Steven Spielberg really scooped the attention when it was released. And the opening scenes, good god, to have run through an unending hail of bullets and mortar shells, pinned down on a narrow strip of beach, nowhere to turn, death everywhere, what to do? feel free to view the documentary 'World at War' where they discuss the invasion in the episode 'Morning'. what happened, when the situation came to light with the commanders on board the battleships off shore that had escorted the troop carriers, after viewing with binoculars and hearing the radio reports, these commanders TOTALLY AGAINST STANDING ORDERS took it upon themselves to move in closer within range of the German batteries, and start dishing out some ordnance to the same German defenders in order to relieve the situation of the troops pinned down.you got that? THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY TO HELP OUT THEIR COMRADES ON THE BEACH.this is the whole story line of the film; self sacrifice towards a common goal. the details of which are merely that: 'filling in the canvas'.I'm just glad these men did such a good job 60+ years ago that my generation didn't have to repeat it somewhere else.as far as this being American 'propaganda', well feel free to write a script and produce your own work on the same topic. The fact is Omaha Beach, the 101st, bitching about Monty's hesitancy and numerous miscalculations are all part of the widely known history.therefore the realism, which I look for, of this film (as opposed to actual specific historical events) is right off the scale. I don't care if its a sci-fi, comedy, western, or drama, I have to see continuous PLAUSIBILITY in what I'm spending my time and money on.this film, SPR, has that in abundance.",10,2,4,9 July 2008
City of God," violence begets violence
","the abundance of handguns says it all.they are very deadly, and the scene where the young hood kills all the people at the hotel and smiles in a flashback is typical of the motivations of far too many hoodlums. they kill not in the course of committing a crime out of necessity to carry out the deed, like shooting an armed security guard, no, they kill for fun and because no one can stop them in the moment.I have fired handguns but not recently, and only at a target range, so I understand the dangers of the bullets flying out at a thousand feet per second. once it leaves the barrel anyone in front is doomed. and the finger pressure to make that happen can be done by a child.city of god should be a warning to us all on the costs of crime and violence. building a city, educating the young and creating conditions that give them job opportunities takes a long time and a lot of work; this is why so many choose the 'easy' way of crime.it is also telling that at one point you start to lose track of who is in what gang and what they have done, and then all the even younger hoodlums get guns and start shooting up the place. and then subtly the action moves into the big city, they are no longer in the shanty town.a depressing film but one that should be seen at least once.I definitely wouldn't rank it so high up in the top 250.",7,3,6,15 January 2007
2012," truly gawdawful formulaic pap
","the computer generated action crew sure got a workout with this one. problem is they displaced huge chunks of the plot line by the wayside.how many 'outrace the falling debris' chases does it take for viewers to finally get the message? and it is very realistic *looking*; problem is the events depicted NEVER HAPPEN in real life. ever. (spoiler)for example, the part where the cruise ship is capsized by the tsunami? hellllooooo! tsunamis only heave up out of the water when they hit shallow shore line and the energy catches up with the wash. (kinda like sonic booms).if you're looking for a deep philosophical question 'how does mankind handle an abrupt end of the earth' to be posed and answered, skip this waste of 2 hours. if you want 'here's an assignment CGA class, make a movie about end of the world; heavy on car chases and buckling crust' then this will satisfy your morbid tastes.",2,3,4,10 June 2010
Patton," quite accurate
","I have studied the career and life of George S Patton for some time and the film, as far as typical Hollywood fare goes is quite accurate.George S Patton was flamboyant, eccentric but intelligent. He overcame dyslexia to become one of the wealthiest commanders in WW II. He was ambitious and intolerant of laziness and low character.the ongoing rivalry between the various allied commanders depicted in the movie is spot on. its part of what makes a successful military career.for all his faults, Patton captured and killed more German soldiers and liberated the most occupied territory of any of the commanders. and then the Bastogne situation was a defining moment.George S Patton despite his abrasive nature was very compassionate. He is the only senior military leader anywhere who I ever saw on film weeping over the loss of those under his command. His approach to war was to fight hard and very aggressively in order to get it over with as quickly as possible. well it worked. if he had been given more leeway WW II in Europe would have finished 4 months earlier and eastern Europe would not have fallen into the soviet realm.watch the movie.",10,5,12,6 March 2005
Black Hawk Down," gritty & realistic
","whereas saving private ryan introduced the hand held camera mode, this film is its culmination.there is a great deal of shooting in this movie but for once it is an integral part of the action. war and combat are very violent and you need to properly portray that in a film like this, especially one based on true events. if you don't know, an RPG is a rocket propelled grenade, and there seemed to be a lot of them in the hands of the somali warlord's camp. by the way aidid, was a real bastard. there seems to be a type that, given the opportunity, will use conflict to make an advantage for themselves and sacrifice the freedom and lives of their fellow citizens to maintain that advantage. collaborators during WWII, east bloc dictators, and office politickers are counted in this group. aidid used the famine in somalia to establish a private army which would confiscate the food aid meant for his starving countrymen. the U.S. under clinton stepped and sent delta force soldiers to establish some order and capture aidid. this attempt ended in tragedy and this film depicts the circumstances and events of the raid.I remember the news about the failed somalia mission and to this day I feel that blacks in Africa have no one but themselves to blame for the fact their continent is the most backward, undeveloped and violent today. rwanda genocide, civil war in congo, massive corruption in nigeria are a very few examples of the situation. you try to help them and all that happens is they drag your soldiers' dead bodies behind a pickup truck to shouts of glee.

The Graduate," college aged angst in the 60s
","I never experienced the chronic self doubt and uncertainty Ben experienced but I know people who have.there are some timeless aspects of this film, a lot of college graduates still go through the 'what on earth do I do with my life now' phase. there is still an immense amount of infidelity amongst the married-single set.Dustin Hoffman really shines in this his early work. as does Mike Nichols.I remember when this film came out. for some reason it was rated so I couldn't see it, but that was typical of the frumpiness of censors back then. when the characters get out of bed with their undies on or drag a blanket around with them that is kind of funny and also dates the film.Anne Bancroft was perfect in this role.and that line: one word: 'plastics' was added to the popular film folklore immediately.",9,1,2,1 July 2006

Jim Carrey absolutely shines in this film. and Kate Winslet too.Jim Carrey's varied roles in my opinion, are his attempt to branch out, experiment, to discover his strong points. well, he has succeeded. he is now firmly in the category of serious actor. but, being Canadian, he doesn't take himself too seriously. you don't hear a lot about Jim Carrey making impossible diva-like demands on his handlers etc. He's still young too, so we have a lot to look forward too from this fine actor.",Null,0,1,8 February 2005
Stalingrad," a worthwhile companion piece
","I have studied the battle for Stalingrad for some time and this film presents I think a realistic depiction of the trials experienced by the german foot soldiers in that battle. Hitler had a grudge against communism and Joseph Stalin in particular, so he wanted to capture his name-sake city as a special prize. The lessons of the previous winter defeat in the attack on Moscow were not learned. The fact that the actors in this movie are not known by the north american audience adds to the mood; the anonymous pathetic front line combatant takes the brunt of the ambitions of egotistical power mad political elite. It is not an exageration that women were fighting on the side of the Russians. I was fortunate enough to find the DVD version in a pawn shop. It includes an optional dubbed english track. It was interesting to see how the subtitles diverged from the dubbing during some of the more 'earthy' sections of dialog.If you like war movies then you will enjoy this presentation.",Null,0,1,1 May 2004
A Beautiful Mind," a beautiful mind, a beautiful story
","If you want to know the *real* story of John Nash then look up competitive dynamics and all his other published works. if you want to know the *real* story about schizophrenia then do some service at your local psychiatric hospital. If however you want an entertaining 2 1/2 hours inspired by a real life experience then watch this movie.John Nash is still alive and described how he marshalled his rational mind to think his way out of his mental disease on a somewhat recent episode of '60 minutes', the CBS news program. After watching that I determined to see the movie. I was not disappointed. Russell Crowe found the right mode for his role and Jennifer Connelly proved more than adequate for the job.
I was stunned by the plot twist. I have never been so taken in by a story with a plot twist than this film. At the encounter between Alicia and John at the 1 hour 15+/- minute mark of the movie it finally clicked that John's dealings with certain figures in his life were illusions. Very quickly when he compliantly cooperates with the drug (insulin) therapy in the hospital I realized he was going to get better. It was therefore a pivotal moment in the movie. I just didnt realize it until the second viewing.Ron Howard has definitely broadened his horizons with this oscar winning performance.Again, if you want the *real true actual* story about mathematics or mental disease or John Nash go to the appropriate sources, otherwise this is a beautiful combination for entertainment's purposes. And besides, John Nash himself did not say anything bad about the movie in the '60 minutes' interview.",Null,0,2,1 May 2004

Africa will sadly continue to lag the entire rest of the globe until a time when amin's type can no longer stage a coup and sacrifice the well being and future of the citizens just so they can enjoy all the perks of absolute power.the sad part of events as portrayed in the film is the bad guys are perfectly willing to play dirty and thereby give themselves an edge in the quest to the top positions. its true of business and politics and amin knew this.,8,0,1,15 July 2007

DeNiro on the other hand in my opinion should have earned a nomination as well as Sam Rothstein the casino owner. Quote: 'back home (east coast) they would have put me in jail, out here they give me awards'. a city awash in cash, proof of the adage 'a sucker is born every minute'.I personally have never been to Vegas and have no intention of going.

I never felt the tug, my suspicions confirmed one day at the local casino when I popped a token in a machine and lo, it came up 'bar' 'bar' 'off by one'.

","with the passing of Marlon Brando I decided to once again view this film that garnered so much interest in the early 70s and beyond. I cant believe how young the lead players were! Brando looked older then however, necessary for proper plot development and atmosphere. I finally understood the manouvering that happens related to the criminal wars that take place twice during the film, once when don corleone has an attempt on his life and then again as michael asserts his influence.I read the book which was better than the movie but only marginally. Im not sure I would vote it best of all those on file with IMDb but I cant think of an alternative. being 'best' is such an arbitrary thing anyway; best in what category? best overall? what criteria? what year? it truly is a remarkable movie though, classic performances and a very tight storyline with some memorable lines and scenes. its no wonder that Al Pacino's career never looked back after this performance.it may or may not be the best movie ever made but it should certainly be required viewing by anyone contemplating a career in the mob. or in law enforcement or film-making or Italian cuisine for that matter.one thing I am sure of, if ever humans reach the stars (pun intended) this will be one piece of entertainment that goes with them.9.999 / 10",Null,1,3,9 July 2004
