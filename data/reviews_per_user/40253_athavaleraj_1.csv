Ford v Ferrari," Old Time Rock And Roll
","A simple heartfelt story of a friendship vs corporate egos. The story's car jargon doesn't confuse the audience.Also the CGI and Pratical effects only enhance the movie and never take away the experience from it. The movie is the beautiful, old fashioned (story arc wise) and definitely a blast!",10,1,3,18 November 2019
