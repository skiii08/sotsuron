The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," amazing the best twilight film
","i saw it yesterday, and i already want to see it again when the wedding scene was over i already wanted to see it again, same for the honeymoon.. it's amazing i love how rob and Kristen played their role! they are beautiful! the only one i didn't like is the dance with Jacob at the wedding,an how she is happy about it at first and later when she speaks to Charly and says that 'it's not the same anymore' about her love..it's heartbreaking he end with Bella transforming and rob trying to save her is heartbreaking too..ho my.. Kristen and rob's chemistry was amazing its really amazing , i've never liked the others twilight films but to be honest the critics are lame and mean i mean saying Breaking Dawn the worst twilight film is like saying New moon is the best twilight film ! at the end of the film everyone was saying that it was amazing so the critics can go die already ANYWAYS, i LOVE it! i'm so proud of them an thank you Bill ! story B , acting B- , directing B+ , effect +C i'm not a twilight fan and actually i became a twilight fan :)",10,6,18,19 November 2011
