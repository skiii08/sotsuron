The Blair Witch Project," this movie sucks!
","when i heard about the blair witch project, i was excited because it sounded very original and i thought it might be something new and interesting to watch.  well, it was original, but, as i soon found out, that alone cannot make a movie good.  in fact, nothing could make this movie good.  i've had more fun watching family videos of my grandmother's 80th birthday party. in fact, they were both made with the same technique.  maybe i should sell the rights to my family videos and make millions and put it on at theatres and call them movies.  there are obviously suckers out there willing to pay to see such crap.  i pity the person (including myself) who pays hard-earned money to see this terrible excuse for a 'movie' (and i use the term movie lightly).  avoid it at all costs.",1,2,3,28 September 1999
American History X," one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen
","American History X is not a movie for the weak.  If you can't stand racism, hate, or anal rape, then maybe you have no business watching it.  However, everyone in America SHOULD watch it. It's the story of Derek, a young man who just happens to be the leader of a local neo nazi group.  After killing two black men who were breaking into his truck, he is sent to jail for three years.  During his stay behind bars, a series of events forces him to change his view of life. Upon getting out of jail, he finds that his younger brother is following in his hateful footsteps.  Derek must then attemp to convince his sibling the error of his ways before it's too late. This movie gives the viewer a chillingly realistic look at how bitter and ultimately sad life can be when hate consumes the soul.  One of the best movies of 1998, second only to The Thin Red Line.  Definately check it out.",9,0,0,10 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," this movie made me think about life in a very different way
","You are either going to love this movie or hate this movie.  There is no in between.  If you liked such movies as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Metropolis (which is very old), then you will thoroughly enjoy The Thin Red Line. However, if you like more concrete movies like any movie in the Indiana Jones series, then you may find it boring and confusing.  Unlike many war movies, The Thin Red Line deals with war on a purely emotional level.  Every narrative and flashback scene is completely stuffed with metaphors and symbolism, which makes it a neccessity to see it at least twice.  I have seen it three times myself, and every time I see it, I find new things to contemplate.  This is an excellent movie and should have, in my mind, won best picture at the Academy Awards.  A truly great film.",10,0,0,10 May 1999
The Godfather," one of, if not the, best films ever made
","what can i say, this film is magnificent.  everything about it is flawless. i must admit, however, that i am partial to mafia pictures, but that doesn't matter.  i'm serious when i say it's a great film.  if you haven't seen it yet, please do so as soon as possible. thank you.",10,1,2,28 September 1999
