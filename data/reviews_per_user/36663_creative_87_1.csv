Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky enough to watch it
","'Lucky Number Slevin'The cast was excellent, with Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui, Morgan Freeman and the great Sir Ben Kingsley. It's not everyday you watch a film with names this huge sharing the same screen. After watching the trailer, the movie looked like some kind of action spoof and that put me off big time. But then my sister told me it was good so I gave it go. Little did I know I would later call this the second best film of the year 2006. (After V for Vendetta) This film totally shocked me. It started off a little silly and confusing, with Hartnett coming across as a hapless unlucky joker but it all started to make sense. And it got interesting real quick then I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. The narrative was illustrated beautifully, set in 70's well I think anyway, that's what the flower covered wallpaper was telling me. Also Set in New York City, a case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (Josh Hartnett) in the middle of a war being plotted by two of the city's most rival crime bosses. At first I thought the film was going to waste my time but I stuck with it because I always watch an entire movie before I murder it in a review. AnywayÂ… the acting was brilliant. Bruce Willis who is not one of my favourites was haunting as a stalking assassin. The best I've seen him perform. Lucy Lui was good as was Freeman and Kingsley. The old guys delivered like always. But Josh Hartnett who I have never really been a fan of was great as Slevin. He was bloody convincing as an unlucky sucker and equally convincing as a vengeful son looking for payback. Not to mention he has seriously improved in the looks department. (My other sister noticed that first!) The movie was quick, slick, The twist in the end was wicked. I was loving it! The whole structure of this movie, the narrative, the camera shots, and the fragmented visuals all worked like magic. It was realistic, it was clever and it was different. The acting was great, the storyline was unique. One of the first scenes in the movie where Willis breaks some guy's neck was awesome; it was really clever how it made sense in the end. The only flaws I could see in this classic is that the film was less spoof -ish and they could have set a more serious tone, they could have developed the gangster's character more; they never seemed dangerous to me; instead comical. Also the start was a little slow and dull. But Hey! A film like this can afford a few flaws it was that GREAT!Witty, stylish, thrilling, full of action. 'Lucky number Slevin' has it all and more. I recommend you see this film. Watch it or miss out!10 out of 10 I love it when I get surprised.",9,1,8,3 May 2006
