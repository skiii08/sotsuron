Black Swan," Boring, yawn, boring.
","What an over-hyped disappointment. Other than watching Natalie Portman act for a hundred minutes, this movie was extremely tedious since I didn't care a thing about any of the characters. None of the characters were engaging, the directing was disjointed and uninteresting, the sex was sophomoric and gratuitous, and I'm glad others had forewarned so I only wasted time and not money on this C- yawn. Reminds me of Basic Instinct with a wannabe baby Esterhaus director struggling for a manipulative plot to justify some sexual titillation and hopefully get buzz. The best thing about this movie was the actual ballet performances. Unfortunately they were few and what was in between didn't justify the wait. What a waste, save your time and money.",1,11,18,2 May 2011
