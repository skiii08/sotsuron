Blade Runner 2049," A film of two distinct halves of quality.
","I stated in my summary that Blade Runner 2049 is best summarised as a film of two distinct halves, and to some extent the statement is true, however in retrospect I now believe the film is more appropriately summarised as a film of three slightly more blurred thirds of quality. Act one was a largely flawless, mesmerising segment. A barrage of exceedingly good, after exceedingly good scenes. Act two pertained to much of what made the first segment so enthralling, though the quality did slightly diminish here. Act three was where I personally observed the greatest shift in quality, due in large part to the conclusion of the film. The conclusion appeared to me as being docile and underwhelming in comparison to the remainder of the film.Ryan Gosling succeeds in delivering an immersive performance as wearied Blade Runner 'K'. By contrast, Harrison Ford's performance seemed unremarkable and shadow; more akin to his role as Han Solo in 'The Force Awakens' than the film demanded. The original Blade Runner hosted a number of exceptional fight scenes. The compliment can be extended to the fight scenes featured in 2049, although a different cinematic approach has been taken to producing them. The cinematography is largely excellent, however I would have appreciated some additional shots of the skyscraper topped, cyberpunk/noir city environment: as I feel the film loses some of it's immersion due this factor.Despite (in my personal opinion) not being deserved of the five star reviews media outlets are constantly firing at it: Blade Runner 2049 is largely a high quality sci fi experience that I recommend you view.",8,1,6,30 October 2017
First Man," Unquestionably a biopic...
","First Man is one of the reasons I am continually wary of biopics, and is virtually a metaphor for the all so detestable 'seven out of ten' film. Being such a film, it lies in between the realms of acceptable and very good, thereby delivering a final product that demonstrates great potential, but fails to utilise it. This may be in part due to the drab and monotone performances of leads Gosling and Foy, presenting the viewer with a more diluted version of the all so refined Gosling we saw in Drive. First Man is undoubtedly a nuanced and competently crafted piece of filmmaking; but one that I fear will claim an undeserved academy award.",7,3,8,14 October 2018
It," Largely a high quality horror experience.
","Rather 7.5 out of 10, for clarification.As stated in my summary: IT (2017) is largely a high quality horror experience.IT hosts an entourage of young actors who are members of the 'Loser's Club' and deliver widely impressive performances. The members of the club are, as individuals, unique and quirky and the exploits of their private lives compose some of the most entertaining on screen material. Despite this, I firmly believe Wyatt Ollef's character of Stanley Uris would have most certainly benefited from some additional lines of dialogue. The aforementioned lack of dialogue leaves his character feeling (not wholly) but noticeably underdeveloped. Alternatively, Skarsgard undeniably excels as sadistic, demonic being Pennywise. The film exhibits a praiseworthy contrast of terrifying moments and humour. It is also worth noting that the film's initial scene serves as a highlight unparalleled by the remainder of the picture, in it's scares, performances, tone and cinematography. That's not to suggest, however, that the film doesn't consistently provide exceedingly good cinematography. With this considered, it is a major disappointment that a dramatically overt cliché crops up in the movie's final act; which is then superseded by a lesser (but still present) one. The film is a mass of tension, which is evident from the offset. It's also succeeds in delivering an abundance of creatively engrossing frights; the majority of which are executed by the exemplary Skarsgard. Overall, IT is a composite of quirky characters, a terrifyingly impressive demon and a contrast of terrifying moments and humour, unfortunately diminished by cliché's in the final act. I highly recommend IT for cinematic viewing, and eventually home viewing following it's release.",8,4,8,18 September 2017
In Bruges," Massively funny, and dark.
","Quite simply, In Bruges is a consistently hilarious dark comedy accompanied by a wonderful performance from Farrell and satisfactory performances from the supporting cast. Additionally, the film transitions competently between comedic and serious moments, and has a number of appreciated (though not entirely unanticipated) plot twists. In Bruges is undoubtedly funnier than any of McDonagh's more recent work, but lacks the standout moments of Psychopaths.",8,0,0,1 February 2018
Deadpool 2," Absurd and irreverant: not for the easily offended.
","Deadpool 2 revels in it's absurdity and irreverence. From the graphic, stylised violence and crude humour to unconventional music and fourth wall breaking antics, the film punishes the viewer from taking it too seriously. Despite failing to match the high standard set by the first act, Deadpool 2 is a largely successful sequel.",8,1,2,19 June 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's delightfully twisted western tale.
","8.5 out of 10 for clarification. The Hateful Eight continues Quentin Tarantino's trend of historical films by immersing the viewer in post civil war Wyoming to weave the bloody tale of strangers meeting up in a remote cabin during a blizzard. Tarantino's signature use of varied and extravagant characters is present here, and on the whole the excellent performances match these abstract personalities. Similarly, his use of extensively bloody, stylised violence is just as effective and compelling as in Pulp Fiction and the film retains his distinctive non linear plot structure. Also, the score is considered but not as compelling as the excellent soundtracks featured in in his previous films. The film gains momentum and peaks during the spectacular final act. However, the lack of his trademark sharp and quotable dialogue is a distressing omission that threatens to jeopardize his 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Overall, The Hateful eight marks a slight decline in quality from Tarantino's most impressive efforts (Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), but is still an accomplished film",8,0,1,18 July 2018
Alien," Incosistently flawless.
","The opening third of Alien provides for an immersive, captivatingly well shot and utterly tense sequence of scenes that sets a virtually impeccable standard of quality for the rest of the picture to match. Therefore it is regretful that, to some extent, the remainder of the picture dissolves into an elongated cat and mouse chase that (despite the best efforts of the writers) occasionally feels dull and excessively long and somewhat dilutes the aforementioned immersion and tension. That isn't to deny that a considerable length of the remainder is composed of commendably tense and terrifying moments. Alien hosts a varied assortment of impressive performances, and consistently delivers some of the most intelligently crafted cinematography I can ever recall viewing. Ultimately , I believe that Blade Runner is the more consistent and overall more immersive picture that succeeds in delivering a more alluring conclusion. Alien may be inconsistent experience, though in it's highest quality scenes it's spectacular and reaches near masterpiece status, warranting viewing.",8,1,2,24 December 2017
Full Metal Jacket," The dehumanization of war.
","7.5 for clarification.One of the film's strongest attributes is it's cinematography, which is exceedingly good throughout. Kubrick seems intent on utilising music at ever opportunity, though I would cast doubt on how effective this decision was. The cast as a whole deliver moderately impressive performances. Kubrick certainly intended to showcase how war dehumanizes the individual, and this allows for the highlight of the film: the magnificent scene in which 'Private Pyle' commits suicide. The film claims to provide dark humour, however If there was such any I failed to observe it. However, I simply couldn't understand the psyche of protagonist 'Joker', as he is such a contradictory figure throughout the film. Is this another effort by Kubrick to demonstrate the dehumanizing effect of war, or a metaphor for the duality of man?",8,2,2,1 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Bordering on masterpeice status.
","Billboards is, for the most part, an emotionally devastating masterclass hosting some of the richest performances I can ever recall seeing. Despite the entirety of Billboards being fairy consistent, there are marginal differences in the quality of the film between it's first and second halves.
Whilst the first half of the film is a commendable effort, it serves more as a prelude to the intoxicatingly good second half, as opposed to being a standalone piece of material. The second half of the film is a richly immersive, mesmerizing gem. As briefly mentioned, the performances are outstandingly compelling. Sam Rockwell was considerably impressive in Seven Psychopaths, however his performance here undoubtedly obliterates it from contention. Frances McDormand 's performance is equally significant and Woody Harrelson's contribution broadly impresses, though I struggle to equate it as being on the same standard as his two lead counterparts. Billboards succeeds in delivering a number of startlingly in depth character studies, and it's fascinating to observe the evolutions of a number of these characters throughout the film. Billboards pertains to a darker, grittier and more realistic tone than Psychopaths, and also opts out of delivering an abundance of humour (be it dark or light). In Psychopaths, dark humour was an extensively underlying component of the film, though in Billboards it largely exists to provide comedic relief from the otherwise relentlessly bleak tone of the narrative, with some degree of success. The film also hosts some marvellous cinematography that composes some incredible scenes through it's profound manipulation of imagery.At no point during it's considerable duration did Billboards present any notion of linearity or being contrived, although a number of additional plot twists or other non - linear devices wouldn't have gone amiss. It is not so much a complaint, but more akin to a comparison between how sprawling and non linear Psychopaths was, in relation to the markedly safer approach taken by Billboards. Billboards is also undoubtedly one of the most emotionally intense and raw films I have seen in recent memory, in stark contrast to the broadly lighter tone adopted by Psychopaths. Overall, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a remarkably accomplished feat that positions itself as more of a gritty, realistic drama (with thriller elements) than a dark comedy.",9,1,6,12 December 2017
Fargo," Quirky, sporadic and excellent.
","Fargo is an intelligently comedic, violent, emotional, and dark composite that's certainly one of the quirkiest pictures I can ever recall seeing. Prior to writing up this review, I read the comment that Fargo can never decide what genre it seeks to be. Despite my grievances with this comment, I do believe that at times Fargo's various elements could've been integrated more effectively. However, these elements are all accomplished and the overall picture is a commendably smooth venture. In regard to Fargo's black humour, to some extent at times I struggled to conclude which material was intended to be humorous, and that which was intended to be serious and impactful, as the borderline between the two felt slightly blurred. Much like the picture itself, Fargo hosts a plethora of quirky and unique personas, made even more credible by the distinguished efforts of Macy and McDormand.Fargo's intelligence is reflected in it's subtle lines of dialogue, events or shots that mimic or reference similar material featured earlier in the film is consistently used to phenomenal effect. It should be noted that the ending sequence is a commendable and reflective accomplishment that demonstrates how self aware the Coen's were of their creation.",8,1,1,22 December 2017
Léon: The Professional," Luc Besson's emotion driven and wonderfully acted thriller.
","Leon is Luc Besson's profoundly acclaimed thriller revolving around the unusual relationship between veteran hitman Leon (Reno) and his unconventional apprentice Mathilda (Portman). This unorthodox relationship creates an abundance of emotionally intense scenes throughout the film, notably the excellent finale. Reno is expertly cast as hollow, emotionally stricken hitman Leon, whilst Portman succeeds as vengeful youth Mathilda. However, Oldman delivers the most enthralling performance as sadistic, relentless DEA agent Stansfield. Leon is also propelled by wonderful cinematography and music decisions.",8,0,1,17 July 2018
Baby Driver," Original, stylish and intelligently crafted.
","8.5/10 for clarification. Baby Driver's opening sequence, and a number of scenes that supersede it, present the film as being an aggressively stylish, intelligently crafted and highly engaging work.Though Driver's magic never fully dissolves, it's aggressive style and engagement slightly diminishes which sadly impacts the overall experience.The incredible and varied performances and the personas they encompass never cease to massively impress throughout the runtime. The relationship between Baby and Debora is commendably original and one of the least contrived I have ever observed. Some of the dialogue is excellently crafted, and this extends to the admirable use of humour. To some extent, the violent fight sequences impress, however they fail to thrill and feel somewhat lacklustre. Overall, Baby Driver is a stylish experience that's complemented further by the incredible performances.",8,1,3,27 December 2017
American Psycho," Enthralling central performance and dark humour.
","8.5 for clarification. Christian Bale delivers an enthralling central performance as narcissistic psychopath and stockbroker Patrick Bateman. This may well be due to the fact that Bale occupies virtually every scene in the film and brings a wonderfully heightened sense of realism to the picture. Leto also delivers an impressive performance. American Psycho is abundant with hilarious dark humour, spearheaded by Bale.The film hosts some exceptional scenes, in particular 'Huey Lewis and The News' and a commendably thought provoking ending.",9,1,2,28 March 2018
Jarhead," A respectable, but not wholly innovative autobiographical account of the Gulf War.
","Jarhead peaks in moments of its stellar cinematography and visual effects, which are scattered throughout the film and are utilised to great effect. It similarly utilises music to great effect. Gyllenhaal delivers a modest performance in the lead role and his character is bolstered a unique monologue that runs throughout the film.However, I could not help but feel as though Jarhead was recycling all the traits of the war film genre: mentally unstable protagonists, a near constant sense of toxic masculinity and some reflections on the horror of war. Despite Jarhead's clear nods to anti war sentiment, this is certainly not so much a politically motivated film as it is the gritty, intimate tale of one soldier's involvement in a war he is (to some extent) excited to be in. Jarhead is a competent film that tells its story in unique ways, but doesn't deliver a wholly original narrative.",7,1,1,18 May 2018
The Machinist," Enthralling performance by Bale in mystery thriller.
","For the majority of the film Bale delivers a modest and successful portrayal of sleep deprived factory worker Trevor Reznik. However, a number of scenes allow Bale to convey his truly staggering acting prowess (rivalling his ambitious portrayal of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho) to the audience. Similarly, Bale's commitment to the role is evident in his flesh stripped protagonist. Not only does the black and white colour palette of the film compliment Reznik's destructive mind and body perfectly, but the many visual hints serve to deepen the mystery. Despite tedious beginnings and a narrative that (whilst commendably non linear) becomes convoluted in areas, The Machinist's final act is one of the highlights of the film.",8,0,1,13 July 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Fails to justify the hype, but a commendable effort.
","Marvel's most ambitious title yet revels in it's frequently remarkable computer generated imagery. From the piercingly realistic Thanos to the glorious depiction of otherworldly planets, it's difficult not to succumb to awe and wonder. Additionally, the action sequences here are earnestly more successful than in the scandalously overrated Black Panther.However, it may be argued that the narrative's dark tone comes into conflict with the protagonists' humorous dialogue, dampening the atmosphere. Despite the positive reception to major antagonist Thanos, his depth amounts to little more than a somewhat contrived origin story.",8,1,6,28 April 2018
Drive," Outstandingly acted and filmed.
","Frame by frame, the cinematography in Drive may well be the most consistent and accomplished style I have ever seen. This use of cinematography, in addition to a largely successful soundtrack presents Drive with a stylish aesthetic. Ryan Gosling is undeniably superb in the lead role. He perfectly connotes the driver's hollow and broken persona so effectively that at times you are able to virtually feel the subtle tension leaking from his stare and can sense the Bryan Cranston impresses too, however his role is certainly nothing unprecedented. Drive has extremely violent moments, though on the whole Refn executes these to a commendably high standard. This is in part due to Refn's masterful handling of tension. On numerous occasions did he raise the level of tension, prior to relieving the tension, prior to delivering the climax. Additionally, nearly every violent sequence felt varied and adopting a slightly different style than the last. Through masterful cinematography, Gosling's exceptional lead performance and some excellently crafted violent sequences, Drive is a high quality experience, if not quite the absolute masterpiece some have hailed it as.",8,0,0,15 February 2018
A Quiet Place," A tense, emotional horror thriller that slightly betrays the hype.
","7.5 for clarification.A Quiet Place fuses an abundance of tense and horrifying moments with unexpected pockets of emotion, including one notable scene approximately half way through the film.The cinematography is unexpectedly accomplished, and serves as one of the highlights of the film. The major lack of dialogue in the film was clearly intended to be original and effective, although in reality it presents numerous issues. Firstly, although we can observe that all the cast are pouring emotion and effort into their performances, we learn desperately little about their characters. Secondly, one of the qualities I look for most in films is intelligent and considered dialogue: something which the premise of the film immediately deprives it of. The film disappoints in its climax, which dampens the atmosphere the film has worked so incredibly hard to attain.",8,0,1,10 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Within this cluttered mess lies epic scenes.
","TLJ undoubtedly peaks during it's assortment of battle sequences which are mostly thrilling ventures, something which is most evident in it's spectacular opening sequence.Unfortunately, virtually every moment outside of these feels lacklustre and left me strongly desiring higher quality material. Despite my general appeasement with the quality of the performances, a notable few came across as being disconcertingly mediocre. One of the most prevalent disappointments was Domhnall Gleeson's portrayal of general Hux, which seemed contrived to the extent that at stages it appeared wistfully laughable.Mark Hamill, however, delivered the most notoriously underwhelming performance. His portrayal of Luke was deeply hindered by the unsuccessful and poorly executed decision to initially present Skywalker as a heretic of the jedi order. The aforementioned argument, in addition to the unsuccessful feat at combining humour with serious moments which only diluted the severity of these crucial events, demeaned Luke's integrity and considerably damaged his credibility as a key role. Whilst I appreciated the belated attempt to 'redeem' Luke, irreversible damage to the overall quality of the picture had already occurred. Throughout the remainder of the picture, however, attempts at humour to lighten the dark tone make the film a commendably more varied experience.Overall, The Last Jedi is an underwhelming effort that is a cluttered and sporadic mess of quality and which is partially redeemed through it's exhilarating battle sequences.",7,0,0,28 December 2017
Saw," A competent, though slightly hollow thriller/horror.
","Despite being such a high profile 'horror' title, the fact that Saw is lacking an underlying sense of dread and tension is remarkably surprising. There are pockets of tension dotted throughout the film (in particular the trap sequences), just not to the extent you may imagine. The cinematography is well executed, and is most notable in moments of aggressive editing ( the trap sequences) where it is used to great effect to create tension.Saw deserves praise for its non linear plot structure, featuring an abundance of flash backs and multiple story lines.The leads deliver modest performances, however the supporting cast are a little more mediocre. One minor complaint is that protagonist Adam sometimes behaves like he's in a completely different environment to the hostile death trap he's been plunged into, including spouting cringe worthy pieces of dialogue.",7,1,3,28 March 2018
The Shape of Water," Not disastrous, but failed to match the high expectation set.
","IMDB users appear incredibly divided over The Shape of Water, with many hailing it as a masterpiece and others dismissing it as a horrendously overrated piece of film making. I believe the film lies towards the former, but fails to reach it by a considerable margin.As the lead role, you may expect Sally Hawkins to deliver the most accomplished performance in the film. However, that acclaim definitely lends itself more to Michael Shannon's ruthless and compelling depiction of 'patriotic' agent Strickland, which I believe is unparalleled by another member of the cast. Guillermo del Toro delivers some favourable, though not entirely innovative or exceptional cinematography and direction (including a moderately effective score). The Shape of Water deserves praise for it's largely successful composite of comedic and serious, violent moments. There aren't a tremendous number of overt flaws with The Shape of Water, it merely fails to deliver consistently high quality material.",7,1,3,16 January 2018
The Departed," Scorsese's nuanced crime thriller.
","8.5 out of 10 for clarification. Prior to viewing The Departed, my only previous experience with Martin Scorsese was The Wolf of Wall Street, and whilst the Departed fails to supersede The Wolf as Scorsese's masterpiece, it remains a nuanced and deeply compelling crime thriller. Jack Nicholson's superb opening monologue greatly elevated my expectation of this film, and whilst I wasn't necessarily disappointed by the remainder of the picture; the introduction was never surpassed. Another strength lies in how the narrative takes a number of turns near the end of the film.",8,0,2,10 September 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Fringing upon a modern day masterpiece.
","Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is a highly accomplished biographical dark comedy that encourages the viewer to revel in and be repulsed by the provocative life of it's protagonist: stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio). The cinematography and editing is slick and fast paced and the film is at it's most intoxicatingly best when pulsing with energy; complimented by a perfect soundtrack. Similarly, DiCaprio, Robbie and Hill succeed in delivering phenomenal performances. DiCaprio's running monologue is witty and the humour occasionally hilarious. However, when the energy fades away and the film slightly loses it's established rhythm does the quality slightly decline.",9,1,2,14 July 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Exceeds the middling critical reception.
","As stated in the title, MotOE exceeds the middling critical and public reception, but not by a considerable margin. It's one of the most consistent pictures I have seen in recent months. Consequently however: it fails to deliver sufficient quality content in order to distinguish itself from amongst the 7/10 region.Every performance is the film is sufficiently impressive, though it's nothing unprecedented. Alternatively, the fact that the film succeeds in encompassing a broad spectrum of unique personas is accomplished ( and to some degree compensates for the somewhat lacklustre performances.The pacing was executed with the competency that rarely did I wish for MotOE to abandon it's investigative section and instead deliver it's concluding chapter.The picture also hosts s sequence of enthralling vistas throughout.Overall, MotOE is a somewhat accomplished film that ultimately I recommend you view.",7,2,5,19 November 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Not a masterpiece, but artfully emotional.
","8.5 out of 10 for clarification.The first half of TSR hosts a handful of excellent scenes, high quality performances, some excellently crafted dialogue and cinematography. Despite this, in areas the drama still veers disconcertingly close to becoming tedious. However, the final thirty minutes of TSR are where the film's true qualities become starkly apparent to the audience, as we are treated to scene after scene of emotionally power, devastating content. However, I do not consider the film a masterpiece, and feel as though it falls short of this goal by a considerable margin. Therefore, the fact that TSR has garnered the fabled number one spot in terms of audience ratings on this site makes me question whether the judgement of the audience is too heavily influenced by the final act and not representative of the picture as a whole.",8,0,1,1 February 2018
The Big Short," Highly successful, stylish biographical drama.
","Like Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short is another darkly comic biographical drama examining the morally bleak world of Wall Street. Whilst The Wolf revels in narcissism and vanity, The Big Short weaves moral ambitions into its story, which is told through the eyes of a number of investors who seek to exploit the 2008 US economic crisis. Outside of sharing a rather niche genre, other stark parallels include; utilising a narrator, a rapid editing style and delivering an exceedingly well made film. The Big Short may not reach the extravagant heights of The Wolf, however it succeeds more than amply on its own merits. Christian Bale's portrayal of socially incompetent investor Michael Burry transcends the rest of the cast and cements Bale as one of the most versatile actors today.",8,1,1,2 September 2018
Trainspotting," Exceeded my expectations noticeably.
","8.5/10 for clarification. Trainspotting's opening sequence is a beautifully powerful representation of what the film undeniably succeeds at and revels in: quality performances an accompanying soundtrack that energises and propels the picture, deliciously dark humour and excellently crafted dialogue. Although some of the drama occasionally veers towards being a little tedious, Trainspotting always seem to redeem itself with a hilarious moment or unique line of dialogue. Throughout it's duration, Trainspotting hosts a commendable number of stunning and original scenes. I personally found the ending to be a spectacular affair that left me reeling to watch the sequel.",9,0,2,5 January 2018
The Purge," A tense and intrigiung, thou flawed horror thriller.
","The purge is a moderately thrilling experience that delivers intriguing world building and social commentary. It is disappointing that the film is undermined by mediocre performances and clichés. The Purge features a number of plot twists, however these are somewhat contrived.",6,0,1,1 July 2018
Sin City," Stylized, visually stunning and extensively violent comic adaptation.
","7.5 out of 10 for clarification. Sin City is the heavily stylized and largely successful adaptation of Frank Miller's comic series. It weaves together the profoundly violent tales of three protagonists seeking retribution in 'Basin City'. The core strength of Sin City lies in it's presentation. The black and white visuals, presence of comic art and distinct cinematography and editing create a gritty, visceral noir atmosphere. Sin City is an abundantly violent film, some of which is stylized and highly effective. Additionally, the film is bolstered by a non linear plot structure and monologues delivered by the protagonists. Leads Rourke, Willis and Owen deliver compelling performances that perfectly suit their tormented roles.",8,0,0,25 July 2018
True Romance," Tarantino's inferior effort.
","Quentin Tarantino is unquestionably one of the most accomplished writers ever to have graced the film industry, however this early effort fails to reflect his unparalleled craftsmanship. In fact, only a single scene throughout the entire picture feels reminiscent of his distinctive style . The aforementioned scene also happens to be the highlight of the motion picture, barely keeping afloat the unremarkable content beneath.",7,1,3,14 October 2018
The Godfather," Great performances, but often tedious drama.
","7.5 out of 10 for clarification. The Godfather's opening scene is masterful effort, with the camera slowly edging backwards to expose more of Brando's figure to the audience, accompanied by a severely emotional and haunting monologue. After viewing this scene, I conceived the notion that at least a large amount of the film will follow this trend. It was eventually made clear that I was misled. It's not that there aren't other instances of great performances, dialogue and plot twists. The issue is simply that a considerable bulk of the picture is borderline tedious drama, and that much of this drama doesn't in fact contribute to character development. For example, Michael's shift of agenda seems to happen remarkably quickly, and without sufficient character development to provide explanation for this.",8,0,0,31 January 2018
