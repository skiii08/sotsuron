3:10 to Yuma," broad, flavorful remake doesn't improve on original but is solid on its own terms
","There is something to be said for attempting to view any remake of a classic film on its own terms, even if one has seen the original film on which it is based. Some remakes, certainly, have been made with good intentions in mind; some have been made with mercenary intentions for the most part in check; and a rare few even supersede the original to the point where they become the standard on which we base our opinions of every rendition of the basic story. Typically, large-scale stories with fantastic or fabulous elements tend to offer a wide range of interpretations and are, for me at least, much easier to envision in multiple versions. The 1940 'Thief of Bagdad' comes to mind as an example of the latter, as does Terry Gilliam's version of 'Baron Munchausen'. So three cheers for all the great remakes out there! '3:10 to Yuma', obviously, doesn't seem to fit into such a category. The original film is a spare, minimalist, rather low-budget B&W Western starring a couple of actors that never quite hit the A-list (Van Heflin and Glenn Ford) in what would be a defining moment for both of them. The new film broadens the canvas, literally (it's 'scope and color) and thematically, with the already fascinating parallels between struggling rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale in the Heflin-originated role) and brutal outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe, equaling and perhaps even exceeding Ford) deepened and expanded, the theme of the corruption that money brings to an essentially poor and land-based economy made much more explicit. The central story though remains simple: desperate Evans, a man unaccustomed to violence, agrees to help deliver Wade up for arrest for enough money to save his ranch.For most of the length of the film, the original story and screenplay are followed fairly closely. The violence is obviously much more intense and explicit and the action scenes more drawn out, though never at the expense of the storytelling. We get more of an insight into the pasts of both men than the '57 version gave us; the gloomy Civil War wounding of Evans may have something to do with his feelings of inadequacy, his need to stand up for himself and the larger community of law-abiding citizens; Wade's artistic ambitions coupled with his awful childhood seem to have warped him into a psychopath with a veneer of civilization that increasingly threatens his brutal values as the film progresses. All of this, and an extended added scene in a railway camp, are offered I suspect to make the finale's striking reversals seem possible, if not exactly realistic  but it doesn't quite work. Bale's Evans is too weak, too introverted and fanatical all at once to seem much more than a 'character'; it was hard for me to buy Crowe's growing sympathy for him, or for that matter Bale's ability to go through with his mission. And Wade is established as just too brutal and self-centered to be really believable in the final moments.Still, the acting overall  especially by Crowe  the pacing, and the staging of the action sequences worked well enough to keep me entertained, and the over-the-top nature of the final moments actually didn't seem implausible until a day or two later. Well worth a viewing overall, and certainly more 'true' to the classic Western genre than many recent endeavors.",7,0,1,29 November 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Always look on the silly side of belief
","Three wise men wend their way to a small hut in a small town, 2000 years ago. They are in search of the Messiah and they come bearing gifts...but first they make a small mistake and deliver them to He who is not the Savior, Brian, who happens to be born on the same day, just down the alley from that Jesus fella. Brian grows up a fairly oblivious and apolitical mama's boy, though with less interesting in stonings than is usual. Alas, events lead him to work with the People's Front of Judea, the attempted kidnapping of Pilate's wife, accidental prophet-hood, and eventual crucifixion to the tune of 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.' The conventional wisdom on 'Life of Brian' is that it's the Python crew's most 'polished' or 'competent' film as a team, and I'd probably agree with that, though I find 'Holy Grail' funnier. It's still scatter-shot and somewhat inconsistent of course - I for one found the whole Pilate/Biggus Dickus thing a bit overlong, and the alien abduction while fun doesn't really add anything besides giving Terry Gilliam more to do - but it does actually feel like a moderately cohesive film, and of course it takes the typical Python over-the-top methods on attacking organized religion to a point which all but the most humor-challenged Christians ought to be able to admit to at least chuckling over - it's a bit more pointed and narrow in its humor. Of course, the film isn't really anti-Christian, or anti-Jewish, but rather anti-stupid. Maybe that was it's biggest problem....Early highlights include the stoning scene and the scene with the ex-leper, but where the film really takes off in my mind is when Brian becomes an accidental prophet. It seems to be channeling or ripping off Holy Grail at first - smart, articulate Brian being completely misunderstood by the idiot peasants, just exactly as Bedevere in the earlier film presiding over the witch's trial - but the brilliance with which Brian quickly goes from being just another hairy crazed prophet (reminiscent naturally of street-corner shouters even today) to being followed all around by a witless mob is startling and hard for me to describe. I think this may be the high point of the Pythons' wordplay, and the fact that it's foreshadowed in an early scene where Brian and others are listening to the real Messiah but misinterpreting his words wildly only adds an icing to the cake. If there's a message to Life of Brian it's that people will hear what they want to hear, and sometimes no matter how clear you think you're being, you're not going to get through to them - especially if God's in the way; also, people want someone else to save them, to do the work of making the hard decisions – even if they have to turn off their brains to believe.I find comedy harder to describe or critique than just about anything else; perhaps that's a cop-out but I'm not sure how I can really get at just how clever and funny the film is without quoting a bunch of dialogue, and what's the point in that? You're here on IMDb, you can check it out easily yourselves. I will close by saying that in one way 'Life of Brian' does seem to 'conform' to the more modern style of religious 'epic' - the Jerusalem and the Jews here are dirty, disheveled, and poor. Gone pretty much for good by this time is the splendor of the 50s and 60s Cinemascope epics - although I suspect that may have as much do with the small budgets of the Pythons' film, and Scorsese's and Gibson's later efforts, as with any conscious desire to make things grubby",9,1,5,5 May 2009
Finding Nemo," stale, if not quite dead fish
","I'm a fairly big animation fan, so it's a bit surprising that I never caught up with this when it played theatrically; I'm also a big fan of Albert Brooks, who does the lead voice for Marlin, and that's probably why I did get around to this now.First off, the animation is just gorgeous. I think this might be the best-looking Pixar film I'd seen before 'Wall-E' -- something about the process just seems to work so well on an underwater adventure, and I liked the cartoonish, lumpy look to the humans as well. Everything is colorful and flowing and moving and exciting to look at -- the filmmakers undoubtedly spent significant time around coral reefs or watching films of them, because the film really does convey the sense of constant motion and teeming life very well, and the animation process was up to it.The storyline, however, just didn't cut it for me. Marlin's a single (clownfish) parent who early on loses his only surviving son, Nemo (Alexander Gould) and goes on a harrowing quest through hundreds of miles of treacherous open seas to find him and eventually rescue him from the dentist's office aquarium he's ended up in, along the way meeting up with ditzy, forgetful helper Dory (Ellen Degeneres). Like nearly every Disney or big-budget animated film these days, the film is filled with cameos from big stars, which doesn't really do anything for me beyond the 'oh cool that's Dafoe' factor; it increases the budget I'm sure, but does it really help tell the story any better, and does it guarantee more box office? It's often a distraction; here it neither helped nor hindered my enjoyment, which was overall medium -- I just couldn't get involved in the story or the characters. Brooks was a big part of the problem, or his characterization; I hesitate to blame him, he was cast as essentially the straight man for much of the film, and his brand of humor is anything but juvenile and thus just doesn't jibe with a kid's film. DeGeneres fare better and was the most interesting actor/character, but on the whole this was for me a fairly charmless, too-long roller coaster towards the inevitable happy ending. I suppose I'm sounding the grouch, but I have liked all of the other Pixar films I've seen; this one just didn't hit a chord for me. Still worth seeing for the phenomenal look, so I'm calling it 'ehhh'; rented on DVD.",6,1,2,25 November 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Fun pastiche of Hammer horror, Poe, Irving and others
","I used to love Tim Burton. Being a sf/fantasy/comics freak from childhood on, Burton was one of the few Hollywood filmmakers separate from the Lucas/Spielberg axis who was making stuff that I could always count on seeing with my non-film buff friends who were into the same sort of genre stuff I was. Loved 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Beetlejuice', and 'Ed Wood', and always looked forward to what came next.But in the past decade or so he's disappointed more often than not. His 'Planet of the Apes' remake was an abortion, and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', while not terrible, didn't seem necessary or particularly necessary either. 'Sweeney Todd' was a little bit better, but still didn't make me particular worry about having missed a couple of his more recent works. I caught up to one of those the other night though, and I'm happy to say that my fears were not (mostly) justified.'Sleepy Hollow', first of all, has very little to do with the Washington Irving story which it is 'based on' according to the credits. 'Inspired by' might be more accurate, and the film takes equal inspiration from the works of Edgar Allan Poe (specifically his prototypical detective character, Dupin) and Hammer horror films from the late 50s and early 60s - going so far as to cast Christopher Lee in a small role at the beginning of the film.The cast is certainly a big, big part of the fun here, with such wonderful character veterans as Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Martin Landau and Christopher Walken all getting juicy (if generally small) turns in this story of a New York police constable, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), with 'advanced' ideas being sent (more or less as punishment) to the small Hudson valley town of Sleepy Hollow to deal with a series of gruesome beheadings, in 1799. As the film develops, Ichabod believes there's a perfectly rational explanation for the murders, and it's to the film's credit and Depp's that as he gradually learns that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman - while also coming under the spell of a young woman at the center of the horror (Christina Ricci).It's all quite beautifully shot, excellently acted with perhaps the exception of Ricci (one of those actors I can never really accept in period roles), who isn't really bad, and it's a wonderful mixture of comedy, scares and thrills, and a bit of the mystic. My only real problem with it comes in the ending, which is too much like a Scooby Doo 'aha, I've got you now' episode; most of the film managed to keep me guessing at least a little bit but the finale is all too typical. Oh well; this is certainly one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in a while, and there's even some interesting stuff below the surface - the whole colonial/witch-haunted/Protestant New England of the 17th-18th centuries brushing up against the coming of modern science and the Industrial Revolution and secularism is quite expertly handled, though it never gets in the way of a good old-fashioned story. Really, loads and loads of fun and probably my 2nd-favorite Burton film at the moment after 'Ed Wood'.",8,0,0,25 July 2009
Crash," Haggis re-defines and expands on the meaning of heavy-handed
","This didn't look all that good to me when it came out; looked like a just-as-obvious only more-black updating of Lawrence Kasdan's 'Grand Canyon' and that seemed unlikely to be something that would win me over. Shocked when it won Best Picture; also shocked that one of my favorite critics loved it, and even more shocked now that I've actually seen it. I knew I was going to be in trouble pretty quickly, the glossy, burnished artificial lighting and restless camera just didn't seem to belong to the rather intimate story Haggis was trying to tell.Ah, but what's that? Intimate? LA is the world, Haggis wants us to believe, and the world is racist, hateful and violent. All of it. Without exception. This is what was so noxious about the film to me -- every single character is a collection of hatred, fear, suspicion and suspended violence; and every character (of course) has a moment of redemption, and obvious and simplistic choice of whether to do 'evil' or 'good.' The cardboard, one-dimensional treatment of the 'people' here is made even worse by the extraordinary and ridiculous set of coincidences that bring them all together, completely Dickensian in scope but completely underserved and unbelievable, because these are not people but types and cut-outs. Asking me to accept all of this in a two-hour film that never fleshes anyone out beyond skin tone and class, and asking me to accept that this is the world we live in....too much, Mr. Haggis. If I believed that 'Crash' was the world, I'd have killed myself long ago. It's hard to remember a more cynical film with a worse view of humanity, which wouldn't alone make the film worthless -- it's the simpleminded, heavy-handed psychology behind it all that does that. And I saw that as someone who considers himself pretty cynical, and pretty negative in his prognosis for humanity. This is unquestionably the worst Best Picture winner I've seen, and one of the worst films of the 2000s so far. I liked a couple of the actors (Terrence Howard especially) and I have to say I was kept interested -- if only to predict nearly every scene and then to choke up laughing when I was right.It's a sad, sad commentary on Hollywood that this film and 'Driving Miss Daisy' are the two most visible, award-winning dramas about race in the past couple of decades, and that two of our most gifted directors (Charles Burnett and Spike Lee), who both happen to be black and have never won Oscars, still have to struggle to get financing on anything that's not white-oriented enough.",3,8,11,25 November 2008
Léon: The Professional," stupid, glossy trash is a low point in the careers of all involved
","Well well. Luc Besson takes on John Cassavetes for the first time in this pastiche (for the first half, anyway) of Gloria. Jean Reno is an illiterate Italian (? it's not totally clear, but this is how he's referred to) hit-man in his 40s in New York, a simpleton with no friends other than his plant, an assassin of inordinate skill (though we see no real evidence of this until the very end of the film) who takes in an orphaned Natalie Portman, a pre-teen when this was filmed but dressing like a hooker through most of the film, eventually agreeing to teach her the assassin's art so she can revenge herself upon the killer of her horrible family, Gary Oldman as an insane, dirty-cop drug-addict DEA officer. Got it? Yeah, I got it, it wasn't hard to figure out....though none of it made any sense, ever. There are a few reviews of this film that have suggested that it be looked at as existing in sort of a fantasy world, and that would seem to be a better way of looking at it. Not much makes sense if looked at in real-world terms, even less sense than in usual in a violent action movie; but the film doesn't seem to have any internal logic. Reno is the hit-man to end all hit men despite being an illiterate simpleton? Oldman is some fairly high-level cop despite being so obviously, categorically insane? There never seem to be any extras around in most of the indoor scenes; there's a whole 5-minute scene in a washroom between Oldman and Portman and nobody intrudes. None of this works in a film that ostensibly takes place in a real New York City Let's talk about the acting. Though I didn't think Reno's character made any sense, I rather liked him, I got taken in by his charm; Oldman on the other hand played a complete cartoon character. Did he play him well? Perhaps. I don't know. Was he supposed to be a cartoon? Did Besson think this was a cool idea? I guess so. It didn't work for me, at all. It was awful. And Portman; I'm not going to necessarily argue that her performance was bad, I'll give a 12-year-old the benefit of the doubt when playing a character that has to alternate between cutesy, slutty, and determined; but again, I didn't buy the person she was supposed to be. And although at the end the film never....quite....indulges in the pedophilic fantasies that it seems to be heading towards, it still comes to close for comfort. Portman wears skimpy outfits throughout, and the camera pays more attention to her ass than is probably necessary. Were this my first Luc Besson film, I might have given him a bit of a pass, but given his usual predilection for waifish, very young model types...ewww.The ending is sentimental, trite, and completely unbelievable. It's an extension of the film as a whole, which probably doesn't even deserve the 3/10 I'll give it.",3,29,60,22 April 2008
Watchmen," Hallelulah, The Times They Are a Changin' All Along the Watchtower
","Could the song choices have been any more obvious, blunt, and uninteresting in 'Watchmen'? The opening Dylan anthem actually worked OK I thought, and the montage of comic panel-like shots from the history of this alternate hero-corrupted universe was reasonably well done. The Comedian's death sequence, also not bad -- but by the time we get through this rather long but in many ways too-short and scattered film to the second Dylan song (in its iconic Hendrix rendition of course) I've had enough both of the 'duh, of course they'd pick that' pop song choices, which had become emblematic of the 'tell, not show' bluntness of the film as a whole.Right upfront I will state that I'm a huge fan of the comic, have read it half a dozen times over 23 years and regard it as certainly the most challenging and fascinating word on superheros that I've ever read - and I'll also state that I've seen neither of Zack Snyder's two previous films. So of course I've got my idea of how I'd like to see a film based on this work - or not see it - but I've got nothing against Snyder for trying. And he does try I think; maybe he doesn't deserve an A for effort, but I do think his heart was in the right place. Brain, not to sure of that. The film does manage to distill nearly all of the principal storyline from the comic into a reasonably coherent narrative - but that's about it. As others have mentioned, Snyder is often slavishly devoted to his source, to the point of exactly reproducing many sequences so that they really do look as if they've 'leaped off the page'. What he doesn't do though is create a narrative flow or really get into the complexity of the alternate-world vision and the ironic and parodic elements that make the comic both fresh and at the same time very backward-looking and critical of its medium. The fact that he can orchestrate a sex scene to Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' and seemingly be unaware of the absolute hilarity of the concept is only one standout moment amongst many, but the biggest problem I have with it as a whole is that the film just doesn't move. There's little if any sense of urgency here - sure, the characters talk like the world is ending, but everything from the dully constructed fight scenes to the flashbacks to the anticlimactic climax just feels like its constructed more to be stared at and admired than to make you feel anything or excite. Rorschach's attempted escape from the police for example just feels inevitable and by-the-numbers, a duplication of comic panels that work much better as - comic panels.There are definitely positive aspects to the film, in fact overall I'd say the cast is (surprisingly, given his reputation) Snyder's biggest plus - well, the casting director probably deserves some props too. Not that everyone or even most of the cast are great, but even the weak links (Malin Akerman's Laurie, Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, and especially Matthew Goode's very weak and unbelievable-as-messianic-madman Ozymandias) aren't really terrible and most of them seem to have at least a bit of commitment. And the strong performances by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Comedian), Patrick Wilson (Night Owl) and especially Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) go a long ways towards making the film watchable. Haley in particular is a standout, virtually duplicating the character note-for-note from the comic and yet really getting some feeling into it, making even the lines that really don't come off well cinematically feel, well, human and natural. His death scene actually gave me a tiny emotional moment, not an easy thing to do in a film so devoid overall of real humanity or emotional power; if this film had come out in December I'd very much like to think he'd be up for some awards, but as it is I doubt he'll be remembered by the end of the year, given how much of a flop this is turning out to be.And some of the set design (the Archimedes, the Martian sequence) was fine - not that Snyder is doing much beyond replicating the comic in this case. What he and the other creative people behind the scene really failed to do, in a nutshell, was to create anything really cinematic in their interpretation. A filmed comic that is devoid of much of the underlying subtleties that made it so great as a comic - in particular the basic storyline, which as I said is coherent, but really doesn't have anything like the complexity or fascination, the revelatory aspects that the original work has - is just a bunch of pretty moving pictures. And given that the pictures, and the film, don't move and aren't shot in any kind of interesting way, what you're left at in the end is a few fleeting cool images, the intensity of Haley's Rorschach....and that's about it.",6,8,16,25 April 2009
"I, Robot"," Mechanical film about mechanical people, for mechanical people
","A film with a lot of interesting ideas almost completely buried in over-the-top action sequences, mind-numbingly boring dialogue and surprisingly shoddy-looking special effects, this EXTREMELY loose 'suggestion' of the stories of Isaac Asimov would have the master rolling in his grave, if he were trite and clichéd enough to engage in it. Mostly a mishmash of BLADE RUNNER, AI and every antihero cop movie ever made, the film follows Detective Del Spooner on a quest to find the killer of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the genius behind the workforce-dominating humanoid robots that fill up nearly every scene in this clunky CGI/live amalgamation. The film supposedly takes place in Chicago, but there is not one slight reminder of that city until a shot of the river near the very end that's vaguely recognizable. Spooner hates robots and suspects them for some reason from the beginning, but we never get to know him well enough to care; the film spends much more time erotically fascinated by Will Smith's big pecs than it does in creating a cohesive person for him to play. Of course, robots aren't people; robots can't kill, or so we are told. There are many quick, fleeting references to interesting themes throughout the film such as: * what does it mean to be human * is hating a harmless machine similar to being racist (both Spooner and his long-suffering boss are black, in a world that seems to have nearly, but not quite, forgotten that fact) * at one point does a human with replacement parts start to become more machine than man * does it emasculate, or ameliorate humanity to have its menial tasks performed by something man-created? * can you actually program a machine to think for itselfetc etc...but they are all subordinated to endless chases and explosions and gun battles. There are no characters of consequence here, and even the seeming possibility of a love story between Spooner and scientist Susan Calvin (based on one of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere. There just isn't time with all the action they have to put in! Not to mention dozens of product placements, and, did I forget to mention, Will Smith's perfect-as-a-robot sculpted body. In fact, given the way the principle actors seem to sleepwalk through this film, the most interesting idea I was left with was a question as to who and what was most robotic in the film; was there, in fact, any human touch to the movie at all?",3,3,5,29 May 2007
Enchanted," A perfect title for the best Disney musical in years
","Giselle is a simple girl living in a cottage in the middle of the woods in the beautiful country of Andalasia, where she is friends with all the furry little animals who come and joyfully help her keep her cozy little home neat and tidy. One day the handsome, brave and rather stupid Prince Edward comes across her as he's engaged in his favorite activity, troll-hunting, and after saving her the two immediately fall in love. But alas, Edward's stepmother, Queen Narissa, has other designs - she doesn't want Edward to ever marry and have a child to take away her throne, and so when Giselle comes to the palace to marry, the Queen tricks her into falling down a deep well, eventually to land in....Times Square. And to leave the world of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty-style 50s Disney animation and enter the world of 'reality.' Kevin Lima's film attempts to walk an almost impossible tightrope - being a film that is both a parody of the traditional fairytale-animated film that has been Disney's bread-and-butter for 70 years, yet also holding onto the fairytale charm and warmth amidst the mockery. Somehow, he comes very close to perfection. No small part of this is due to the absolutely radiant presence of Amy Adams as the real-life Giselle, walking, dancing and (wonderfully) singing her way into the home of divorce lawyer and single father Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) - who of course believes that the princess is everything she in fact turns out to be, while daddy takes a little while longer to accept this mad, magical girl.Life is further complicated when our handsome prince (James Marsden) appears on the scene as well to rescue Giselle and take her back to Andalasia to wed. By the time he finds her though, Giselle has started to learn that our reality is as interesting and wonderful as - if far less simple than - her cartoon homeland and when the evil queen (Susan Sarandon) finally makes an appearance in the flesh, it's clear that Giselle's human mind has started to dominate her animated heart.I haven't experienced so much sheer joy and delight in a film in a long time; why oh why did I miss this in the theater? Adams is spectacular, funny and naive but so utterly convincing and 'real' in her 'unreality' - she really feels like an alien being through the first 2/3 of the film, so solid and literal and deliberately one-dimensional, and it makes her eventual transformation into a more real woman all the more special. Her songs are mostly wonderful - 'Happy Working Song' is the best movie song I've heard in a decade at least - and the rest of the cast is more than solid. It's got all the adventure and thrills that the best of the Disney classics had, with loads of references both subtle and overt to such films as Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and especially Snow White, but it never feels particularly derivative or lacking in enthusiasm and verve despite all the cobbling it does from other sources. The soundtrack is mostly terrific, the choreography solid, the animation makes me long for the return of traditional Disney pen-and-ink work. I had a feeling I'd like it, but I didn't expect anything this excellent. If there's a flaw, it's that the ending feels a little too rushed, and some of the CGI just looks a bit weak compared to the traditional animation. But these are small issues, and I suspect I'll like this even more on a second viewing. Just wonderful.",9,2,3,25 July 2009
Before Sunset," Ecstatic
","Paris, 2003. Jesse, an American writer in his early 30s, is signing books and giving a talk at Shakespeare & Company, the famed Parisian bookseller that first printed 'Ulysses' in 1922. The book chronicles a one-night stand nearly a decade earlier that he just can't get out of his mind. As he is about to finish, he locks eyes for a moment on a particular face in the stacks: Celine, the woman he met nine years before on a summer night in Vienna. For anyone who has seen and loved 'Before Sunrise', the film chronicling that meeting, the moment of recognition in this sequel comes as an all-time great moment in cinema...five minutes in, and I knew I was in the presence of greatness.Celine and Jesse go for a cup of coffee at a café, traversing a half-dozen windy, ancient Parisian streets, and they talk about careers and education, what has led them to this place. Interestingly enough, the dialog was largely scripted by the actors, and they both express (non-acting) interests that mirror the real lives of Hawke (a successful novelist) and Delpy (an environmental activist and musician who has recorded a couple of albums); they also play to their ages and they play characters that are reasonably successful in the outward sense, so a great aura of realism is maintained with little effort. This allows the dialog to ebb and flow, to continue easily for the 80 minute duration of this real-time walk through the streets and gardens of Paris, through life, career, love, lust, politics.And it all may seem very boring to you, if what you expect is 'drama' and 'event'; if you expect your romances to be full of sex and unbelievable situations and jealousy and hysteria. 'Before Sunset' is 80 minutes of two very intelligent, articulate people reacquainting themselves with each other, reawakening to youthful aspirations and romantic hopes that they assumed were withering. It's a paean to French ideals and American excesses, to Paris and to music and to architecture and literature, all conveyed in the expressions and words of two hopeless romantics and in the passion their director has for the noble idea, so rarely practiced, of the importance and power of each day, each hour, each minute of life.I'm going on a bit perhaps, but I cannot think of a more 'real', knowing film about love, about the lost past and the hopeful future than this minimalist tour through the eyes of a brazen Texan and a talkative Parisian. It's easy for me to fall in love with actresses, but Julie Delpy is simply unbelievable here and I've rarely felt more jealous in a movie than I did of Ethan Hawke (who I rarely like, but seems perfect here).There are many wonderful allusions to film history in this hour and a third but the most potent is the short cruise down the Seine near the end, which brings to mind most obviously two of the most romantic and expressionist films in French history, Vigo's 'L'Atalante' (1934) and Carax' 'Les Amants du Pont Neuf' (1991). I was wondering if this film would end there, but instead the couple detours to Celine's apartment for the stunning, very appropriate finale.",10,1,1,3 May 2007
Across the Universe," Misconceived homage ends up being a travesty that should be avoided by all Beatles or movie fans
","I have to admit, I went into this much against my better judgment, and probably saw it for one of the shallowest of all reasons: the title. The title song might be my favorite Beatles song, certainly it's high on the list, and I thought, any film that makes a big deal out of one of the Fab Four's most musically innovative songs can't be all bad...Boy was I wrong. I really have no idea how much the theatrical version of the film that I saw was tinkered with against Taymor's wishes, how 'compromised' it was, but from my perspective this was a horribly misconceived idea right from the get-go. Graft songs by the mostly apolitical, rather surreal and very British Beatles onto a story involving mostly American characters fighting the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement; have most of the songs integrated into the film in a completely literal and obvious way; don't reference the musical nature of the 60s at all otherwise except by showing a Janis Joplin and a Jim Hendrix clone, thrown together with the English hero Jude (a poor working-class lad from Liverpool doncha know) and the love of his life, Lucy (in the Sky with Diamonds, of course). Throw in some Bay area psychedelia, obvious Grateful Dead/Furthur/Ken Kesey references, and you've got yourself a movie guaranteed to puzzle anybody even remotely acquainted with the era or the music, if not infuriate them.It's not entirely terrible; I'm actually quite thankful that the filmmakers chose to use actors that could actually sing, and allow them to perform the music rather than post-dub actual Beatles performances (probably impossible) or covers by better-known musicians; and for the most part they do a credible job. None of the performances seems on its own a disaster, if none seem like brilliant interpretations either. And the cinematography was excellent throughout, though the dirty old England/bright and colorful USA seemed a bit of a 'Wizard of Oz' metaphor to me which I don't think was intended.But ultimately, this is an incredibly stupid film that insults its audience and insults the music of the most important cultural force of the last century, by dumbing it down to the point where the average 5-year-old will make the connections. Throughout the film music is used, not as a counterpoint or an impressionistic addition to the plot, but as the plot itself; the storyline is built around the songs, and thus seems utterly trite and phony, and simple. Great as the Beatles were, their lyrics if just read on paper aren't always masterful, and they weren't primarily storytellers. I could imagine someone constructing a movie-world from the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen, or possibly Dylan, but Lennon-McCartney's vision isn't terribly cinematic and the film paints nearly every scene with such blunt strokes as 'She came in through the bathroom window' -- just after a major character has done so. Shortly afterward the down and miserable Prudence is called upon to 'come out and play'; when Jude's girlfriend takes up with an antiwar activist and Jude gets upset, he storms the hippies' offices with 'You Say You Want a Revolution.' There are a few songs that seem to fit better, to offer more of an aside to the action or to just express the inner thoughts of a character in repose -- 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' sung while Jude is in exile back in England, worked pretty well. On the whole though, this is shallow, foolish and simpleminded, and the enthusiasm of the actors/singers just can't carry the day. Theatrical viewing.",3,6,11,21 January 2009
Stardust," A bigger budget does not a better fairy tale make
","Well, where to begin with this one? Let's start by saying that I don't pay much attention to mainstream movies coming out these days, unless they involve a director (Eastwood, Scorsese, Gilliam, etc) that I'm interested in, or the reviews from critics I trust are great. So this one showed up without my knowledge. Initial reviews were mostly decent, and I investigated a bit, as I like fantasy, especially the more fairy-tale type and even moreso such tales that have any orientation towards adults. This might fit the bill! Ah, it's based on the Gaiman/Vess graphic novel; I hadn't read it, but I'd paged through it and loved the art, and I liked Gaiman's work on Sandman. And there just weren't many films playing theatrically here in Vermont that looked any good at all. So, off I went.It starts out OK, typical young-man-goes-off-to-see-the-world sort of thing, in this case the world beyond the wall outside of his village, literally another world called 'Stormhold.' How it got to be juxtaposed with this little slice of England, why this particular man gets to enter it -- never explained. Not much of anything is explained, in fact, anywhere in the movie. The man comes back after a night of bliss with a young maiden in the town of Wall on the other side; a few months later, a song arrives on his doorstep. 18 years later the son, Tristan (a fairly dull Charlie Cox) disappears over the wall himself to literally catch a falling star for the bitchy, stuck-up girl he wants to impress (Sienna Miller, showing no talent). The star turns out to be a girl (Claire Danes) and it turns out that everyone in the kingdom wants to get his or her hands on this fallen star, mostly for nefarious purposes.The film lumbers along, entirely predictably (gosh, Charlie and Yvaine, the star, don't get along at first -- what could be the end result) and at times seems to be trying hard to show a sort of 'Princess Bride' wit and self-mockery, but it never gets there for a host of reasons, including dull and obvious direction, very choppy and equally obvious editing, a mostly lethargic and too-serious principal cast, and one of the most overbearing and unoriginal film scores I have ever heard. What few saving graces there are belong to the seasoned veterans in the cast (Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Robert DeNiro and Mark Strong among them) playing character roles. The film feels at least 45 minutes too long, and certainly doesn't help raise my hopes for genre pictures in the future. The CGI was mostly distracting and not all that convincing.In short, pretty abysmal.",3,8,25,7 September 2007
Hero," Beautifully acted and photographed but not much more than spectacle
","Given the early success of this film around the world and its belated large-scale release in the USA, plus the earlier artistic and financial popularity of Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger', it's probably safe to say now that the conflation of art-film and martial arts is a genre that is not going away.I'm glad; the martial arts film is every bit as important to the pop film culture of Asia as the western is in the United States, and there isn't any reason to believe that the potential quality of the 'chop-socky' couldn't reach the heights that Ford, Hawks, Mann, Eastwood, and Leone among others hit with that quintessentially American (and later, Italian) genre. 'Hero' as much as 'Kill Bill' wears its influences obviously, though perhaps in a less overt and flashy see-what-I'm-doing manner. The story of 'Nameless' (read: Clint Eastwood's characters in Leone films) as he bests the finest of assassins is retold several times in several ways, leaving us to ponder Rashomon-like the real truth. The feats of individual skill and heroism are reminiscent of and even more impossible than those in 'Crouching Tiger' or 'The Matrix' (itself heavily indebted to martial arts films), though in keeping with the conservative and heavily censored Chinese film culture the violence is strictly PG-13. The film pushes its mythic single-hero capable of defeating armies conceit to the point where any tangible association with a real historical past is moot; these are Gods walking the earth.The film is awesomely beautiful with intricate color schemes changing scene by scene; the camera-work typically crisp, clean and painterly as in Zhang's previous films; and the performances are a good as you could expect from four of the greatest Chinese actors of their generations -- Eastwood-like Jet Li, emotional and vulnerable Tony Leung, fierce and proud Maggie Cheung and wild, impulsive Zhang Ziyi. I'm totally in love with Maggie who I've been following since 'Irma Vep' and 'Comrades, a Love Story'; hard to believe she turned 40 on the day I originally wrote this piece.And yet, the great parts don't quite add up to a masterful whole. It's incredibly beautiful, stunningly acted and fought, and fairly tightly plotted, but there just isn't a lot to grab onto; the characters don't transcend their archetypes, and the end seems predetermined. Perhaps this would appeal most to the hard-core aficionados; I liked it quite a bit, and I'm glad that Zhang (once beloved in art-house circles for 'Raise the Red Lantern', 'Ju Dou' and 'To Live') has a hit and that the foreign-language film seems to have some hold in America yet, but it just didn't leave me with much. Worth a look for sure, but it doesn't improve on its forefathers.",7,1,2,20 September 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," Powerful, heartbreaking antiwar anime
","I watched a dubbed, letterboxed VHS rental. First off, I'm pretty much an anime novice. I've seen four films from Miyazaki, Paprika, and that's it apart from a few things I saw 20 years ago that I barely remember. I've liked what I've seen, but nothing quite blew me away until Princess Mononoke which I saw a few weeks before this; I was hoping this would do the same.No way to do this without spoilers, so be warned. At the very beginning of the film, a young boy is dying in a train station. He dies, and it is (apparently) his ghost who guides us through and watches over the rest of the film. Seita is an adolescent boy, and early in the film he and his much younger sister Setsuko are orphaned during the late stages of World War II. Bombs level their city and their mother lies seriously wounded for a while until she succumbs. The most powerful single moment in the film for me comes halfway through when we learn that Setsuko, who Seita has been shielding from this knowledge, has already learned what happened.Seita takes Setsuko to a distant relative's house, but she soon tires of taking care of them and they strike out on their own, finding a bomb shelter to live in. Unfortunately, they have little money and no means of making more, and both begin to starve....the inevitable ending is grimly foretold several times in the film and comes as no shock.But throughout the film we find scenes of the joys of childhood, the innocence even in wartime that can allow kids to be kids, games to be played, violence to be forgotten. It is the interspersing of these scenes with the physical and emotional devastation wrought by the war that makes for a powerful experience. Still, for me at least -- though I hate to be churlish -- this didn't quite come together as the masterpiece I thought it might be. It all felt too familiar I guess, and I was irritated by Seita's unrelenting (and stupid) optimism at times; it just seemed out of place and perhaps intended to provoke a response that I just couldn't give it.All in all, powerful but not quite great",8,3,5,22 April 2008
Black Snake Moan," More than just sexy exploitation junk
","I've got to admit, I rented this for less than noble reasons, perhaps even prurient ones. Christina Ricci running around near-naked for the whole film? That's something I gotta see.OK, enough of the dirty old man act. Except that that's what the film is aiming at, isn't it? The poster -- the ads -- the first scene -- this is going to be an exploitation film, and an over the top one at that, with nubile, waifish nymphomaniac Rae (Ricci) ending up bloodied and beaten on farmer and ex-bluesman Lazarus' (Samuel L Jackson) doorstep, just at the moment when Jackson seems about ready to go 'round the bend.So Lazarus, after nursing the physically sick Rae back to health over a couple of days does what any rural farmer in the south would do with a woman half his age and of another race -- he chains her to a radiator in some odd misguided effort to cleanse her of 'evil spirits' or some such nonsense; it's never spelled out very explicitly just what Lazarus believes, or doesn't believe, he can do.There's plenty of exploitive, trashy fun to be had here; our heroine does indeed run around in next to nothing for nearly the whole film, and Jackson's tortured musician Lazarus embodies a whole lot of fun southern black stereotypes -- and I do mean fun; this is certainly a film that tries to avoid racism at all costs. If anything, it's saying that sure, blacks and white are a little different -- they're just messed up in different ways, and we'd best try to understand that, because we're all in it together. They certainly are in director Craig Brewer's vision of the mid-south -- this small town has to be the best-integrated place in America.But never mind all that. The film moves, the dialogue is mostly crisp, the acting (especially, and surprisingly, by Justin Timberlake as Ricci's rather confused boyfriend Ronnie) is solid. The biggest problem it has is that it doesn't know whether to continue down the sordid route, or attempt a little morality play and make nice at the end. Unfortunately it goes the latter route, but there was enough realistic local color and heart to the whole thing that I still found myself enjoying it. Watched on DVD.",7,2,4,30 November 2008
The Wrestler," Rourke's redemption? Aronofsky coming down to earth? Yes to both, and mostly for the best.
","Randy the Ram's glory days were in the mid-80s, as the cheesy graphics in the opening credits remind us, the camera panning over old pictures and tear-sheets advertising his matches. Randy's a professional wrestler, an entertainer whose body is his business, as we're reminded over and over, sometimes subtly but most of the time fairly bluntly in this very heartfelt film about his life and potential redemption. And by extension, that of the former big star who plays Randy, Mickey Rourke.This is Rourke's film through and through and in a year with a great many very fine male lead performances - Sean Penn in 'Milk' and Clint Eastwood in 'Gran Torino' both managed all-time-great work - this might be the best. Rourke inhabits this role like a second skin, a bruised and bloodied steroid-enhanced skin with a mind under it that is active enough but still delusional, still the video-game-playing headbanging kid of the 70s and 80s despite the adult responsibilities that he just doesn't want to face. He's too old for this world, as a heart attack early on tells him; but he's also not fit for the 'straight' life of working in a grocery store and being a father either.Shot in Super 16 with a low-budget grungy vibe throughout, 'The Wrestler' doesn't really do anything new apart from being (apparently) the first Hollywood drama about professional wrestling; you could slap most of the well-worn clichés here into most films about boxing, drag racing, etc and they'd be right at home. And a lot of the subtext is pretty obvious too; when Randy falls for a stripper (Marisa Tomei who must have made a pact with the devil to look the way she does at 44) we can see pretty readily that, unspoken or not, the themes of performance vs real life, acting a part and knowing when to stop acting, responsibility in the midst of still playing the childhood dream of being the macho guy or the gorgeous babe are going to reflect equally on both stars. And Randy's attempted reconciliation with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is similarly predictable, though the scene where they go to the deserted and decrepit seaside town is pretty moving anyway.I really didn't like Darren Aronofsky's previous film, 'The Fountain' at all: pretentious, pretty for the sake of being pretty, full of grandiose ideas never really developed. 'The Wrestler' is no question an attempt to take the opposite tack, and some people are calling it pretentious for the very reason that the director is trying something different! A ludicrous criticism if you ask me, and this film has a lot in common with both the gritty street scenes of his first two films ('Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream') and the overt redemptive story lines of 'Requiem'. It doesn't reach as far or as wide as any of his previous work, but in a great many respects it succeeds more fully in what it does attempt.So you don't go into this for originality, you go into it for great acting and verisimilitude in the decaying Jersey atmosphere, and it succeeds phenomenally in those regards. The ending will disappoint some who want easy resolutions, but if it does they weren't paying attention; there are no easy answers here, and the choice of Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song at the end ought to make that much clear. Life is hard; all Randy can do, finally, is narrow it down to the one thing he loves that never let him down, whether it kills him or not, and all we can do is savor the moment.",8,0,0,27 January 2009
The Lion King," 'Hamlet' it ain't - good Disney, it ain't either, I'm afraid to say
","For starters, I've been a big Disney and animation fan all my life; seeing Pinocchio at a pretty early age and 'Robin Hood' on its initial release made huge impacts on me, and by the time this film came out I'd caught up with all of the Disney features. I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from 'Peter Pan' through 'Oliver and Company' with a few exceptions. 'The Little Mermaid' seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked 'Beauty and the Beast' even more. 'Aladdin' was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to 'The Lion King' with even more spectacular results.For 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time, and every time I mention that I get people reacting as if I told them I was the Antichrist. Seriously - I think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate 'The Lion King' than if your feelings are negative about 'Citizen Kane', 'Casablanca', or '2001'. It's always struck me as weird, because I know I'm not the only person to dislike it, and in fact none of the friends I saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like I did either.I think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that I disliked from 'Aladdin' in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here. I hated Whoopi and Cheech, hated the music, hated above all what I saw at the time was an infantilist assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film, Scar, also is pure evil, and all of the 'good' characters are white-bread, boring, stupid. Dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever; the songs sucked; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films. I suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film, too, but those are lost to me at the moment.I'm pleased to say on this re-watch that I don't HATE the film anymore. But I still don't like it. The issues with the treatment of Scar - not sure what I was thinking there, that was over-the-top on my part. Sure Jeremy Irons' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character, a Godless intellectual I suppose - but it's not really that overstated or deliberate, it doesn't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore. James Earl Jones' Mufasa may not be a genius, but he doesn't come off as a dumb noble-hearted brute either, and nobody can really beat Jones in that kind of role. The opening sequences are somewhat impressive, and the film is rarely boring. I actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), and it's good that young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up.But...I still hate the music; 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' I actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs, but even it was so cloying and just banal that I had a hard time not fast-forwarding. This is purely a matter of taste, I make no bones about it - I like very little of Elton John's post-1970s work and so it's not surprising really. I still find the hyena characters irritating, unfunny, and way over-used. The female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no, the film ain't obviously racist like I guess I thought it was (though it's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones) but it's definitely a boys' film. Timon and Pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle, no wit to me. The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the 'spectacular' scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and 'Pocahontas' in succession.",3,19,44,13 September 2009
Ben-Hur," Still epic after 50 years
","'Ben-Hur' isn't really a film about Jesus, or rather it's a film in which Jesus is the main character, but he's never seen except in partial glimpses, never heard. Rather he is the character around whom the life and fortunes of the Jewish prince, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) revolves, though he doesn't know it until quite late in the film.I haven't read the 1880 novel by General Lew Wallace, nor have I seen either the 1907 1-reeler or the 1925 Fred Niblo version, also a long and expensive epic. But William Wyler's film is fascinating to me in part because of this absence of Jesus - and the absence of religion from much of Ben Hur's life in the film, though not from his thoughts. The basic story is really quite simple: Ben Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judeah after years in Rome, now a tribune and second in command to the military governor or prefect. Though the two seem overjoyed to see each other we quickly learn that Messala both have ulterior motives in renewing their friendship - Messala to help crush opposition through Ben Hur's help, and the Jewish prince to accomplish the exact opposite. This is not a friendship made to last. In short order, Ben Hur is accused of a crime he didn't commit and sent to the galleys; after years of rowing in chains, he saves the life of a Roman consul during a naval battle, for which he is freed and eventually becomes the consul's adoptive son, all the while earning a name for himself as the greatest charioteer in Rome. But his heart belongs to his homeland, and as quickly as he can he returns to take vengeance on Messala, who has also imprisoned his mother and daughter. Messala, also a great chariot driver, will eventually face him in the justly famed chariot race where no rules apply and each man plans to seek the other's death. This 9-minute action sequence really is as thrilling as I remembered it from years ago and is deserving of all the praise it gets; it has a 'real time' you-are-there feel to it that I've never seen in any other historical epic.But in the background is always the young rabbi, roughly the same age as Ben Hur, who gave the then-slave a drink of water as he was about to be shipped off to the galleys, and who the now-freed son of both Rome and Judeah feels compelled to offer the same favor as the Crucifixion draws nigh. Jesus appears in long-shot or in partial view for perhaps 5-10 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hour running time here, but his presence lingers throughout; the biggest problem I had with the film, in fact, was in the last half hour as the rather cheesy-looking scene on Cavalry translates is intercut with the healing of Ben Hur's now-leprous mother and sister and his own conversion - it all seems to obvious and simplistic; but I guess that for a believer it must work. Too, it seems that Ben Hur is able to have his cake and eat it too: achieving his vengeance, getting his fortune and family back, finding the love of the onetime slave girl who had been promised to another. Sure, he suffered, but at the end his worldly happiness seems more obvious than any spiritual redemption.This isn't a huge flaw for me, however, as I realize how difficult such a dramatization is, and in particular when filmed by believing Jews and Christians and intended for an audience that had not yet tired of such simple homilies and the grand scale that the film does, at least, still impress with. The acting is all pretty much what one expects in such a thing - lots of declamations and stagy, overly dramatic glances, hands thrown up at the site of lepers, etc. The photography is quite beautiful if completely unrealistic - this never really looks like the holy land, never really even looks like the real world, with a lot of dreamy overlit closeups, deep shadows when deemed dramatically necessary, interior lighting that is sometimes indistinguishable from exteriors -- none of it matters really, if you accept that this is 'big scale Hollywood Biblical melodrama' and look at it in terms of its success as a genre piece. I like a lot of the actors in smaller roles, particularly Frank Thring as a somewhat sympathetic, realistic Pontius Pilate whose words of wisdom Ben Hur rejects in one of the best scenes in a film that is really dominated by intimate character interludes despite its reputation for spectacle.On the whole, it works for me, Wyler is a fluid enough storyteller to keep things moving despite the immense length and the extremely wide format is rarely a distraction, if rarely necessary either. It's easy to see why this was such an immense hit, earning the equivalent of over $700 million today theatrically; it's also to see why it marked the peak of the genre and why it all went downhill rather quickly, as it was such a grueling production that few filmmakers would want to tackle such a thing again even with the potential of very large returns. By 1966 or so (John Huston's 'The Bible') the genre was effectively dead, at least on such a large scale.",8,0,2,5 May 2009
Before Sunrise," Celine and Jesse Go Romancing
","The simplest of all movie stories: boy meets girl. And it's done pretty simply in this incredibly affecting and joyous celebration of young love; but simple, in this case, is a pathway to greatness. Simple, in this case, means intense, focused, and rapturous.Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are on a train, sitting in the same car a few rows apart. Celine is reading book in French and Ethan an English-language one; they each gaze out at the passing countryside occasionally. A couple near Celine start arguing loudly in German; she moves and sits down near Jesse. A halting conversation starts up but quickly becomes comfortable as Jesse learns that Celine's English is near-perfect, and that each is alone. They have dinner in the dining car and engage in small talk and learn a little about each other: Celine is on her way back from Budapest to Paris where she's going to school; Jesse is on his way to Vienna to fly back to the USA after bumming around the continent for a couple of weeks. They both seem by turns shy and aggressivethe train pulls in to the Vienna station, and Jesse impulsively asks Celine to get off with him and spend the evening wandering around the city, as he doesn't have the money for a hotel room. After a little hesitation, she accepts.I don't know if Linklater or his lead actors/co-writers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were familiar with Jacques Rivette's 1974 Céline et Julie vont en bateau or not; I suspect that the director at least was. Like Rivette's film (the first half hour in particular), this is about two people wandering around a big and beautiful city, getting to know each other, and going off in unexpected directions, and like the earlier film this was co-written by the cast and heavily improvised. The obvious similarities pretty much end there – Rivette's film develops into a relatively humorous and fanciful murder-mystery, its two female leads never developing a romantic relationship; Before Sunrise is a quite serious (though never 'heavy') romance and the male/female dynamic is always in play. But the two also have in common a love of the city and of exploration, a sense of the city as adult playground that is surprisingly not all that common in cinema – at least not in our suburban world today.I don't mean to suggest that this film is burdened with heavy European art-film tropes or that it is lacking in originality – far from it in fact. For a film with such a simple storyline and some obvious points of reference both French and American (think several Judy Garland romances from the 40s in particular) this is anything but clichéd or dry; the growing joy of our two leads is palpable and their explorations all both real and ordinary ( watching street performers, eating and drinking in old cavernous bars and beautiful outdoor cafés, a palm reading, street performers, a walk through a cemetery) and fresh because of the commitment that Delpy and Hawke bring to playing characters that are certainly reflective of themselves. Celine is the relatively mature and articulate, politically minded intellectual – Jesse the slightly more posturing and juvenile proto-philosopher whose ideas usually seem more scattered, but also perhaps the more original thinker. At various points each of them takes the initiative, carrying the budding romance forward; at various points each one retreats a little, though overall it seems that Jesse is (slightly) more pushy. There are certainly commentaries about the differences between Europe and America here, but only once does it seem over-the-top (a bar scene where an American couple rudely complain to each other about the service); generally this is a film about what we have in common, not what drives us apart.After the long and wonderful night, it's time for parting. Celine gets back on a train home; Jesse prepares to board his flight. They've made a connection, beyond a one night standthey vacillate over whether to keep in contact, finally deciding on a scheme that comes straight out of An Affair to Remember and the childish romantic fantasies we've all had: in six months they'll meet again, at the same time, the same train station. You'll have to watch the equally wonderful Before Sunset to find out how that turns out.If there's a more feeling and wise film about two people meeting and falling in love, I'd like to see it. I've seen this three times and it's only improved on each viewing. As I said above, it's not 'heavy', it's never overly philosophical or artsy, but it's not stupid either – and given the state of American romantic comedy at the time (and since), that would be complement enough; but there's also just enough fantasy and whimsicality here (how is it that the two are so often totally alone and able to indulge in deep, uninterrupted conversations in well-lighted alleys, never disturbed; would the barman really give Jesse a bottle of wine on a promise of later payment, etc) to enliven the situations without taking away from their central truth. We can see plenty of differences between Celine and Jesse developing, but also enough commonalities and real attraction that we really wonder, and want to know, what's next between them. Not many Hollywood romantic comedies leave me wanting more (in a good way); this certainly did. For once, I'm glad there's a sequel.",10,2,3,25 April 2009
The Deer Hunter," overwrought epic of Vietnam and the homefront
","Vilmos Zgismond's cinematography is the best thing about this overwrought, overlong male-posturing saga. In the beginning, the accents and locations ring false -- if this is supposed to be realistic, it doesn't work as the huge cathedral where the wedding takes place clearly doesn't belong to small-town coal-mining PA anymore than the deer-hunting sequences obviously shot in the Rockies do. Had the film seemed more naturalistic or expressionistic, this wouldn't have bothered me but instead it seemed like a situation where director and writer did their homework, then just threw away what they didn't like. The wedding sequence was intolerably long and pointless; the Vietnam sequence harrowing but disturbing as much for being devoid of any political context as it was for the horror of what was going on. I found it fantastic that there is virtually no discussion in the film of the morality of the war -- not whether the characters or filmmakers are for or against, but that they show almost no opinion -- what's on screen certainly shows us something of the damaging effects of conflict, but it could be any war. Perhaps that was intentional, but to me the tension between this heightened reality (Vietnam is all wars) and the more mundane elements just didn't work, and I couldn't tell if it was intentional. I liked the sequences of DeNiro coming home and readjusting the best, and his was for me the richest and deepest performance, and character. I'm surprised that Walken's (good) performance of a much less complex character won the Oscar.Still, it kept me going, and there are moving sequences. Just not all it's cracked up to be I guess.",6,1,2,21 April 2008
