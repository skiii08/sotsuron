Vertigo," Just how great is Vertigo?
","Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work stars James Stewart as a former policeman turn detective in 1950's San Francisco. As is typical with our favorite director, Hitchcock creates his art without cutting back on entertainment, which is why so many consider him motion pictures' greatest film-maker. First time and repeat viewers of Vertigo are compelled to continue viewing Hitchcock's film until the chilling, unexpected end. Vertigo's conclusion is anything but satisfying but rather a life-changing slap in the face. It is probably the greatest film ever made. Stewart and his costar Kim Hunter also give their greatest performances. Barbara Bel Geddes's small supporting performance is equally effective. Hitchcock's incredible eye for landscapes is never more keen as it is in Muir Woods, a California Mission, and around San Francisco. (By the way, the shots of the mission were taken from several missions and assembled together to create a nonexistent mission.)",10,2,3,22 November 2006
The Little Mermaid," 'The Little Mermaid' Surprised Me
","It has been ten years since 'The Little Mermaid' was released.  Back when Disney originally released the film, I was both excited and apprehensive. Excited, because it is one of the best children's stories and one of my favorites.  Apprehensive, because I knew Disney would change the ending and give it a happy ending, which is understandable but still unfortunate. When I first saw it, I liked it much more than I thought I would, and after each repeated viewing, I have liked it more and more.  I am now convinced this is the second best American Animated film, after 'Beauty and the Beast'.  The music, story, writing, and animation are superb as others have stated, but the villainess, Ursula, is also a major factor in the success of the film. She is the best written and performed of all Disney villains.  She is purely evil but totally believable.  Pat Carroll, who I have often noticed but never really considered, did a fabulous job with Ursula's characterization. The music and songs are consistantly very good.  There is no deep thought to this one, but 'The Little Mermaid' is artfully near-perfect entainment.",Null,32,36,28 April 1999
