The Sound of Music," This movie is corny, but I love it
","This movie is corny, but I love it.The Brady Bunch (TV), Grease 2, Mary Poppins, and THIS movie goes against everything about me which is WWF! Smackdown, Fight Club, and NBKillers, but I have to admit I really like this movie. Perhaps it's because I am a nutcase and this movie is a secure, innocent movie or something.
Watching all the happy children sing and dance will make want to chase them down with a battle axe and slaughter them but it does give that epic, movie of the time, classic feel to it like the Titanic.I didn't much like the ending though, it reminds me of The Lord of the Rings ending which sucked too. Anyhow, a 10/10.",10,1,7,24 January 2002
L.A. Confidential," Keep it confidential and never tell me.
","When I first saw the commercial for this movie, I was interested to see it. When people were buzzing about how good it was, I was really interested.
After seeing it, I simply shrugged. I thought it was very boring and I didn't think Kim Basinger was that great. Although I liked Crowe and Spacey in this, I didn't like any of the others like Divito and Guy Pearce. After all the oscar stuff, I even saw it again and still nothing.
To this day I still can't think what is so great about it or remember any scenes that really stick out. It reminds me of another really dumb and idiotic movie called Forrest Gump. I am glad Titanic beat this pile of rubbish.0/10",1,18,76,24 January 2002
Forrest Gump," thumbs down
","I am an easy going movie watcher and I am easily entertained by movies on all levels like Die Hard, Scream, Beetlejuice, Titanic, NBK, Splash, Mary Poppins, etc. But I never understood what was so great about this movie. I didn't see any charm in it at all. The Pulp Fiction guys should have won the bulk of the oscars not this.I also agree with one of the comments above that it is easy to act retarded and that Tom Hanks wasn't great. Really Boring, I even watched it again just to make sure it was boring. Thumbs Down!!!!",1,23,53,5 August 2001
American Psycho," you want to make an omelet you gotta crack some eggs
",This is an awsome movie.I love the part when he's chasing the woman out the door naked with a chainsaw and then drops the chainsaw right on her head.Bale's voice is funny and I laughed at his character throughout this entire movie.a date movie - rent it today!,10,0,1,7 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Please do not waste your life on this
","As soon as I heard this was being made I thought: Titanic.That is the only reason I know these money hungry guys made this movie because they saw Titanic succeeded. Anyhow I am glad they failed with this piece of crap.I rented it because Kate Beckinsale is hot and I liked Brokedown Palace but even she couldn't save this. They copied everything from Titanic.
After watching this, I wanted to blast my stove on high and climb in there and burn myself or take my toaster and start slamming my forehead. Luckily I didn't, and I lived on to see the Lord of the Rings -and at that!- made me start slamming the toaster against my head. Lord of the Rings was horrible but not as bad as this. I hope Star Wars 2 is better- if not I am jumping out a window.Please do not waste your life on this.0/10",1,0,1,24 January 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," One of a kind!
","I have seen perhaps every kung fu movie out there and they are all silly. Don't get me wrong I like them for what they are, but from an objectional point of view they are all silly.Crouching Tiger isn't necessarily a Kung Fu movie. It simply is a great movie with kung fu in it. You know...like Road House?! Ha ha. J/KI thought the idea of being able to fly =ing your emotions or control of your emotions or the purity of your soul was a great idea. Chow Yung was a master of his sprituality and was able to fly to heaven in the end. The girl Ziu Zang wasn't necessarily Evil (or NE for you D&D peeps), she was simply free-spirited. As for Jade, she couldn't fly so on and so on.The only part I hated and could have been done better was when Jade fired off all those darts and he sliced them all up. It reminded me of the part in Robin Hood: Men in Tights, when the guy with the dagger diced up the arrows and I started laughing to myself.I thought this movie should have gotten Best Film and Ridley Scott getting Best Director at the Oscers. Because in 25 years this movie will still be remembered whereas Gladiator will become just another movie. Also since CROUCHING TIGER was the most talked about, NOT Gladiator.10/10Peace out.",10,0,0,24 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," Please, Mummy, do not return again.
","I can't beleive I got tricked into seeing this. I kept telling myself it was going to be dumb but I went because The Rock was in it and The Rock says 'The Rock says to see The Mummy Returns'. So I went. God Almighty...After watching this I wanted to drive to Beverly Hills, buy a map to the stars' homes, find Brendan Fraser and smash his head against a wall 50 times. This guy should be blacklisted or fired from Hollywood. I know this is a movie in which the actor is supposed to relax and allow the story to carry itself but even that was bad! The mummies looked dumb. Did you see those cute little baby mummies?! What were they trying to do? Copy The Return of the Jedi with the cute little Wookies?The girls weren't attractive at all, not even that 'bad guy' girl model. The only good thing was the bad guy egyptian leader who fit his part and was good, he should be in more movies.I know the Scorpian King is going to be just as bad also, and I am telling myself not to go, but I know I will, boy am I a dumba$$.0.5/10",1,2,4,24 January 2002
Titanic," I am a guy, I like this movie.
","I am a guy, I like this movie. No, I am not a girly guy neither.Fav Movies: NB Killers Fight Club Die Hard Matrix Sixth Sense Gia Watership Downand yes, Titanic. Don't get fooled into thinking this movie is bad by these other idiots. It's just because all the teeny boppers liked it which means they can't like or they will be viewed as *****S.Let's just say if this movie wasn't overhyped and didn't make as much money, nothing bad would have been said. It's also not on the IMDB 250 list because all the hoi polloi don't own computers (or don't come to this site) and can't voice their opinions like the Fight Club crowd here (me included).I thought Leo and Kate were awsome and I thought the script was great. It is very easy in life to bash something people put a lot of work into. Why don't you go try acting or writing a script or hell -even getting a job.People here bashed the dialogue. Why? Well, because like I said -they are idiots. Listen to people in day to day talk, listen to yourself as you talk to your girlfriend, wife or whoever, no one talks in poetry or in artsy dialogue. The dialogue in this movie is accurate. That IS how everyday people talk!I think James Cameron did a brilliant job and had a lot of balls for making such a costly picture. I am so glad Pearl Harbor was a failure because while Cameron WAS really trying to make a film, the Pearl Harbor Team & Disney were just out for money.You can't say J Cameron was out for money, nothing this big had every been done and he was at risk of losing a lot of money. What would you say if it had only grossed 30 million at the B.O.? Exactly, Shut Up.10/10",10,1,3,24 January 2002
Beetlejuice," Film Classic
","A Film Classic.No? You don't think? Well then -you have no brains.It ranks in there with these other classics that will always be remembered in the land of Hollywood:Mary Poppins Clueless Wizard of Oz ScreamYou just hate it? Don't you? Well too bad, because it is the truth.Beetle Juice is a wacky movie that will live on 50 years later while movies like LA Confidential, Gladiator, The Godfather and all these so called 'Greats' (yeah right, they're all boring) will be long forgotten (by the regular people -the ones who count, not the critics who enjoy stupid movies).10/10",10,3,8,24 January 2002
