Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It was great, much better than the first
","Where the first was over-the-top with the humor and gore, the second is more somber in tone, the emphasis on dialogue and character building. I really enjoyed it.  I disliked the first one.  There's much much less action in this film, but what there is is quite intense.   He really hits for the fences with different techniques. One that caught my eye was his use of different film stocks.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it. This is more like a Tarrantino movie than Vol. 1, although the dialogue was better in the movies where Roger Avary was his writing partner, but still there are plenty of gems here to be heard. 9/10.",Null,0,1,17 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Incredibly Entertaining
","While not the best movie I saw this year, it was the most entertaining. Yes, it seems the script is 'dumbed down' so kids can understand it. Yes, it does seem to have some kind of racial undertone regarding some of the aliens. And yes, the kid playing Anakin is awful. But, the plot, action scenes, costumes, and special effects are top-notch.  Isn't that what you're seeing this for?  When I left the theater I was unsatisfied because I needed to know more. Who was Darth Maul? Lord Sidious?  Where'd the kid come from? Why didn't the Jedi Council send more people to help Naboo? Maybe we'll find out in the next movie.",Null,0,0,10 January 2000
Memento," Solid flick, difficult to follow until you get used to it
","Recommended, but you absolutely must pay attention to get anything out of the movie.  The three main performances of Pearce, Panotolino, and Moss are outstanding.  The story is told backwards scene by scene to the beginning, where the revelation comes.  The only negative thing I'll say is that the wrap-up involves a long explanatory speech by one of the characters that feels like a wrap-up to you, the viewer. This left me feeling that I worked so hard to follow everything, and it was handed to me at the end.  But that's small potatoes.  See this flick, pay attention, and enjoy it. 8/10",8,0,1,20 September 2001
American Beauty," Blew me away
","I must say this film utterly blew me away. I found myself feeling guilty at all the fun the writer pokes at suburbia, the family, marriage, and teenagers.  But it was dead-on. The last 20 minutes of the movie gets pretty serious, and I found myself shedding a few tears.  Should get Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress (the daughter).  There was a bit of convolusion at the end, and maybe this was on purpose.  I have to see it again!",9,0,0,4 October 1999
28 Days Later...," Extremely intense
","I left the theater shaking after taking this one in.  It's not for everyone. I would not call it scary, but intense.  There are some of the most horrific and brutal murders I've ever seen on celluloid in this flick.  Not to mention some white knuckle situations.  In all, I'd recommend it, if you have a strong stomach. I counted 7 walkouts during my visit.Additionally, I've read many reviews - including some here - that state the last 3rd of the film with the soldiers doesn't work. I disagree.  It is there to make a comparison to the 'zombies'.  It works.  You care for the characters in this flick.  I liked the look of the digital video as well, it is not a detraction.In all, recommended, 3/5 stars.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I can't believe all the positive comments...
","I was disappointed.  It's merely average, and there's too much padding to bring it out to a 1 hr 45 minute length.  Take the scene when the plane's touching down in Tokyo, or the final battle in the snow between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride.  It's unique and stylish, but very poorly written.  You can see how much ex-writing partner Roger Avary had to do with the dialogue, just compare this to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.   I just can't believe all the hype, especially from critics.  But what astounds me are the posts on these boards.  'QT is back', 'QT is a genius', '10/10!', 'Best movie I ever saw', etc.  This board has to be rigged. An 8.5 rating and in the top IMDB 100?  
Wait for the video.  7/10 (for uniqueness only).",Null,0,0,20 October 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Excellent, challenging film
","This film is a challenge to watch. I must see it again.  There is so much ambiguity in the film, so beware.  Nicole Kidman should be nominated for her performance.  Cruise, probably not.  The digitized orgy scenes are a hype: you wouldn't know they did anything if you didn't hear about it first. By the way, that entire scene is worth your $8.00. It's tense and disturbing. Some people complain about the Cruise-Pollack conversation at the end.  I saw that as ambiguous as well.  People lie, you know. And of course, Kidman's final words make for a fantastic ending.  This picture is not for everyone. You have to like film, not movies (i.e., explosions, teenage angst, etc.).",9,0,0,27 July 1999
The Witch," Recommended for its uniqueness
","It's hard to classify this movie. Let's call it Gothic drama. There's really nothing scary. I'd say overall it's unsettling. You know this family is screwed when they leave their settlement to live alone. And there's no ambiguity - it takes a path and goes down it.The acting is top notch. The story works when you realize what the end-game really is. The music is downright creepy, creating a tone throughout. And that has to be the thickest woods I've ever seen that is not a jungle.The very last scene sticks with you. It comes out of nowhere.ed",8,2,7,29 February 2016
The Iron Giant," Great film
","I'll tell you, no film this year will tug your heartstrings like this one. It's animation, but not directed at kids so much as both kids and adults. My family and friends couldn't understand why I wanted to see this.  I cried my eyes out at the ending, the same way I do every year when I see It's A Wonderful Life.  It's a shame a pedestrian film like Blair Witch is getting so much attention, when you have a FILM like this being overlooked.  See it.",9,1,2,11 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Very good movie that caught me off guard
","Not your normal Bruce Willis movie (a good thing).  Very good at setting up a tone of dread and not letting up.  The child, Haley Osment, hopefully will get some more recognition. I kept thinking 'Why couldn't he be Anakin in The Phantom Menace?'  A few shocks, but mostly creepy.  The best scene in the movie is the girl's funeral at the end.  Stay away from spoilers!  The ending totally caught me unawares!  Don't miss this.",Null,0,0,16 August 1999
The Martian," Disappointed
","Best picture? Really? It was average. What's worse is I've come to expect so much from Ridley Scott. The acting was pretty good, but it's just such a run-of-the-mill story: man gets stranded, but survives, people come to rescue him. Yawn.It just seems to me Matt Damon could do this type of role in his sleep. And Ridley Scott could do the same in his sleep.There was really no tension in the flick. You knew how it was going to turn out. Not recommended.ed",6,2,4,29 February 2016
