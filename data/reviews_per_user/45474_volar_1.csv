The Ring," Wow...wow...wOw......
","I personally have never seen the original of this movie, nor after seeing this movie do I plan to. Why? because I think i'm already emotionally scarred for eternity.The plot summary of there being a video tape where if you watch it, in seven days you will die simply doesn't scratch the surface of this movie. From 5 minutes into the movie to the time you see the ring right before the credits you will be taken to a world that creates itself right before your eyes.Was it scary? Sure, but it was something more than that...What? I have no idea, but what I can tell you is I had to actually remember to close my wide-open jaw once the credits started rolling.Realistic movie? No way, but lets face it, what good horror flick is. People who write a bad review of any kind(which you'll notice by the VERY high rating not many people have) have absolutely no imagination or fun in their life and should just call it quits now..go crawl in hole and wither away...Let me put it this way. Our theater, which is one of the newer 'super deluxe cinemas' was pretty full, and after the movie was over from getting up out of our seat ALL THE WAY to our cars not one person spoke a word...noone. I didn't hear a peep from a single person from that theater....I think they were all in the state I was in...absolute awe.All I can say if you go see this film(which if you do not go see it you are nuts!) is good luck...Rating: 9.5/10",10,0,0,18 October 2002
