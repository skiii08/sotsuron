Deja Vu," Deja Vu, an intriguing story with some 'worm holes'
","Anyone who is familiar with Tony Scott's directing ability will know to expect an entertaining show with some good action, classic 360 degree aerial shots, and close up camera shots. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington reunite to make another film. Denzel plays the role of a cop who is asked to help the FBI in solving a terrorist attack using some state of the art equipment. In time, Denzel finds out that the power to look into the past has been created and becomes obsessed to save the life of a girl who has died. Denzel does a great job in acting as he always done and is matched with some great action shots and effects. The story itself is a very interesting one and gets you interested pretty deeply. By the end of the movie, there are a lot of unexplained events which causes the audience to speculate what in fact the story was about. Some more clarity could have settled some of these unanswered questions. All in all, if your looking for an entertaining movie with some great action, go check it out.",8,1,3,30 November 2006
Spider-Man 3," A cheesy story and even cheesier acting
","I'm sure everyone had high expectations for the the final spider adventure, but sadly to say, I was quite disappointed. You can tell they were struggling with the story in this one, because there was constant weird plot changes that really made no sense and took away from the movie. Also, it slowly began to turn into a corny love story, instead of a action comic movie, which it should be. Tobey Macguire and Kirsten Dunst perform one of their worst acting performances of their career. There was line after line of cheesy dialogue that took away from the story at hand. Of course the movie will be a hit, its spider-man. But I hope that Spiderman has spun his last web.",3,0,2,7 May 2007
Nacho Libre," The Jack Black Attack
","Jack Black returns to the big films in a great role suited for him in Nacho Libre. Director Hess (also directed Napoleon Dynamite) does a great job in giving Black freedom to steal the show. The movie depicts a Mexican Priest who has a secret fantasy to be a Luchador (Wrestler). Nacho Libre (Black) attempts the difficult task of living the life of the Luchador as well as the Priest of the orphanage. Anyone who understands and recognizes Jack Black humor, will strongly appreciate this movie. From the classic faces, to the funny dance moves, he continues to bring on the laughs as he takes over. There are even a few musical performances by Black as well. If your looking for in your face Ha Ha humor like Old School and Wedding Crashers, you won't find much here. However, if your looking for a hilarious background comedy, this movie is filled with it. Jack Black is one of the few comedians out there that can literally carry a show. You will want to see it again and again!!!!",9,2,5,26 June 2006
The Mist," Cheesy Graphics...Bad Acting...Plot Holes...and a $10 Refund.
","I do have a respect for the accomplishments that Stephen King has done, but 'The Mist' needed to stay in the vault. The movie is set up great and does a great job of grabbing the audiences' attention and curiosity of what 'lies in the mist.' The movie quickly takes a turn for the worst when the worst display of effects in the history of the big screen were shown with the monster. These effects should not have even been approved for the Sci Fi's channel Movie of the Week.The movie than tries to move the story along by involving a 'religious fanatic' prophesying destruction of the world. This side story has no relevance in the movie and just causes irritated noise to the already distressed story.The end hope is that the whole movie will be saved by a 'Michael Jordan' ending. However, anyone who has ever seen a Stephen King movie could have predicted how it was going to end. My advice to Mr. King: Continue to keep your visions on paper, and let the film experts transfer it to video.If you do decide to see this movie, find out what your local theatre's policy is for returns and, if possible, see it during matin√©e pricing.",2,3,12,1 December 2007
The Da Vinci Code," What can you do when the book is already pure genius?
","Ron Howard's movie Da Vinci code received a lot of flack early on by critics saying there was no flow to the movie and there was no connection between Tom Hanks (Langdon) and Audrey Tautou (Sophie). However, I beg the differ, and give, if not, more credit to Howard for not slaughtering the already genius and Best-selling story.One of the hardest tasks in film-making, is the one of taking a very successful book with a huge following and transferring it to the big screen. We have seen few successes with this (Jurassic Park, Lord of The Rings, etc.). Dan Brown's book, Davinci Code, already contained a great story which captivates and draws in the reader. Ron Howard has the task of trying to unite everyone's imagination into one movie by also not trying to offend anyone of different perspectives. Indeed, I do agree that it was less descriptive, but it took me 1 month to read the novel, and the movie is about 3 hours.Tom Hanks performs well as always, however I think a slight miscast on casting him as a knowledgeable Professor. There is good flow to the movie and we are not drowned by long slews of dialog explaining every detail of Da Vinci's work as well as the Templar Knights. I believe Howard did a good job of extracting the essentials and tying them in for the audience to grasp the principles of the book. I am sure for those who have not read the book, and only saw the movie, consider it one of the best of the year. Howard continues to earn my respect and deliver good, entertaining movies.",8,3,6,23 May 2006
Lord of War," The movie 'Blow', but with guns.
","There is nothing better going into a movie and having no idea of what you are about to see. I do have to say, the opening scene was very artistic and creative with following the ammunition, and really set the stage for the rest of the movie. Nicholas Cage is great, if you cast him his part in a movie. If you need a smooth, charismatic, yet somewhat scum-bag of a guy, Cage is your man. His narrative addition, kept you interested in the film.A lot like the movie 'Blow', starring Johnny Depp, 'Lord of War' breaks down the art of dealing arms starting at the first step. One always recognizes that we have gun problems throughout the world, but do they ever stop to think how it becomes a problem. This movie does a great job of accurately portraying how it is done. Anytime I can watch a movie and say 'that is exactly how I would react in that situation' I find that scene a success. Cage does a great job in portraying reactions of what would really happen being put in certain situations he is put in. The light humor keeps a good rhythm. Not only are you entertained in this movie, but also leave realizing real life problems that are affecting our world everyday. I recommend seeing this film.",8,0,2,4 October 2005
