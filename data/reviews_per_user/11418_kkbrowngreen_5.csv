The New World," I prefer the Disney version but this wasn't bad
","I watched The new world for my history through film class. We watched this movie to get the understanding of the life of Pocahontas(Rebecca) and when John Smith and the English settlers came to Jamestown,Virginia. 
 
This movie is about how everything changed for the Natives when the English settlers came to Jamestown,Virginia. When the English came to Jamestown they started doing expeditions of the terrain. During an expedition Captain John Smith lead some troops around some terrain and that's when the Natives attacked the group and took John Smith as captive. John Smith was about to be killed and then Pocahontas saved his life by taking her head and putting it on her chest and so now she has to teach him the ways of the Naturals. 
 
I thought this movie was well made because in 2005 they actually had tech and effects that would look good. By the way the actors/actresses were dressed I could tell that the time period they were basing the time period in the 1600's. The effects were good, the war and everything else they showed in this film were good. I thought that the acting was good, the actors did a good job - Christian Bale.I would question the historical accuracy on the dialect that was used for the English settlers.Colin Farrell spoke more towards his Irish accent than an English accent . With the dialect I also thought the language of the English settlers would have been more of older type of talk than what was used like a modern language. But besides the dialect I would say the historical accuracy was good. I have seen connections made between Disney's Pocahontas and The new world .The movie Pocahontas also shows when she saves John Smith's life and etc...I liked the actors in this movie.
I liked how this movie showed how life was like for the Naturals and the English settlers. 
I liked the different soundtracks used in this movie.The only thing I didn't like was how there was limited talking because it made the film seem longer than what it was.Overall I liked this film.I thought this movie was good and I liked how it showed the history for how it was like when the English settlers came to Jamestown,Virginia and I liked how it showed how both sides saw this event occur. I would like to see more movies with some of the same actors ,such as Christian Bale and Colin Farrell. I think I might want to watch another film directed by Terrance Malick.",6,0,0,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?'
","I watched this movie in my History through film class. This movie is a classic film.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid is about the legendary bank/train robbers. Butch and the Kid rob banks and trains until on one of their train jobs police came out of a steam train to arrest them. Butch and the Kid are on the run from the police, but they just can't seem to get away from them. When they finally get away by jumping into the river they go get Etta and they decide to go to Bolivia.This movie was filmed in 1969. There wasn't anything about this movie that I would question the historical accuracy. The stunts were good. The camera work was good.I haven't seen any other movie that connect to this one. I've heard of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid before but I haven't seen any other movie connections.Things I liked:
-The acting by Paul Newman and Robert Redford
-The set
-The storyThere wasn't anything that I didn't like about this filmOverall I really enjoyed this movie. I learned more about Butch and the Kid. I enjoyed the acting. I would like to watch more movies with Paul Newman. I would like to watch more movies that are directed by George Roy Hill.",10,1,2,23 October 2018
The Alamo," 'Remember the Alamo!'
","I watched this movie for my History through film class. 
This movie is about the battle of the Alamo and the history of how Texas became part of the United states. There were very few men fighting against Antonio Lopez e Santa Anna's army in the battle of the Alamo. On the American side there were such men as : James Bowie,William Travis, Davy(David)Crockett, and etc.. This film shows how one loss can turn into into a victory. This movie was made in 2004 and I think that the special effects were good. I like the acting that was done in this movie. The acting done by Jason Patric,Patrick Wilson,and Billy Bob Thornton was very good. The setting used throughout this movie was good. I think that the historical accuracy was pretty good throughout this movie. I haven't seen any other movies that connect to this one. Things I liked:
-The acting
-The effects
-The soundtrack(Violin(Davy Crockett))I didn't have anything that I didn't like about this movie. Summary:
Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie. I liked the history of this movie and I think the actors did a good job of showing the audience that history. I liked the acting and I would like to watch more movies with Jason Patric,Patrick Wilson,and Billy Bob Thornton. I would like more movies that are directed by John Lee Hancock. Question- What does it mean to be a hero in this situation?
This movie shows the true meaning of what it means to be a hero. The men that fought for America in the battle of the Alamo stayed and stood there ground. Instead of trying to run these men stayed to fight for there country. Even when James Bowie was dying he stayed and fought, on his death bed he laid there with his pistol to fight the oncoming Mexican soldiers.",9,0,0,14 October 2018

When men encounter the Themyscira the Amazons take action and Diana finds out about the war that's going on in Europe and she wants to go and fight.The only thing about not historical accuracy in this movie is 1.

'I used to want to save the world. To end war and bring peace to mankind. But then, I glimpsed the darkness that lives within their light. I learned that inside every one of them, there will always be both. The choice each must make for themselves - something no hero will ever defeat. I've touched the darkness that lives in between the light. Seen the worst of this world, and the best. Seen the terrible things men do to each other in the name of hatred, and the lengths they'll go to for love. Now I know. Only love can save this world. So I stay. I fight, and I give... for the world I know can be. This is my mission, now. Forever.'",10,14,26,19 November 2018
