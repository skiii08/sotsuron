Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows Review
","Sherlock Holmes (Dir. Guy Ritchie, 2009) was one of the movies that I most enjoyed in 2009 and I had been eagerly awaiting its sequel. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (Dir. Guy Ritchie, 2011) was however not the sequel I had anticipated. A Hollywood film needs action scenes but Sherlock Holmes cleverly integrated narration and slow motion before a very fast paced fight scene so as to show Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) thinking before a fight, like Arthur Conan Doyle had written. However, the first action scene had no commentary. I was then filled with a sense of dread that there may be no narrated fight scenes at all; thankfully this was not the case. One of the best scenes in the film was the shared slow motion fight, between Holmes and Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). This scene is narrated by both characters as they think out their fight before it actually happens, this scene is one of the only reasons people should see this film. Yet another annoyance I had with the film was when Holmes and Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) were on screen. Their relationship in the first film was enjoyable and quirky to watch as they would often back chat and argue with one another in a comical way. In this film however they 'comically argue' too many times to count. It soon became tedious to watch with the knowledge that when they next met each other there would be another round of quick fire remarks between the pair of them. Unfortunately for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows it is forced to contend with Sherlock (BBC,Writ. Mark Gatiss & Steven Moffat). The characters of Holmes and Watson, played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in the TV series, are far superior to Downey Jr. and Law's creations. This could be part of the reason I didn't enjoy the film as much as I might have, as I now have Sherlock to compare Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows to. One of the biggest surprises I had when watching Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was the appearance of British icon and celebrity Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother, Mycroft. Although he doesn't resemble Downey Jr. in the slightest, Fry was still a pleasant surprise and provided a lot of comical relief and enjoyment in an otherwise dull first half. The film did pick up in the second half, however, as Holmes and Watson left England for France, Germany and Switzerland. Noomi Rapace's character also featured a lot more in this half of the film. Rapace, who is most known for her performance in Män som hatar kvinnor (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009), was disappointingly mediocre in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Her screen presence was so weak; her character might as well have not even been in the film. It seemed that she was solely there to appease complaints from female critics over the lack of female 'heroes' within the film. But even with the feeble character of, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace), the second half still propels the film forward with new locations and epic challenges for Holmes and Watson. If you enjoyed the first film then this one is worth a watch, if only to see Sherlock and Moriarty compete. If, however, you haven't seen either I recommend checking out the first film before Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.",6,1,1,12 January 2012
The Hunger Games," A slow and frustrating film that is held together by its strong and capable cast
","Because of all the hype surrounding The Hunger Games (Dir. Gary Ross, 2012) I presumed it was going to be heavily entertaining and enjoyable. But on the contrary, it was slow and frustrating. I found little empathy for any of the characters and struggled to understand what should have been a very simple plot that somehow became more and more complex as the film dragged on. I will firstly point out that I have not read the books and so I went into the film with only the understanding that The Hunger Games focuses on a yearly event where children end up fighting other children to survive. By the end of the film I discovered that The Hunger Games was essentially a desensitised Hollywood adaptation of Battle Royale (Dir. Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) with a greater back story. Also because The Hunger Games is based on the first in a series of books I was able to tell that nothing bad would happen to the protagonist, which perhaps helps in the films slow narrative progression.The Hunger Games rushes the beginning plot in order to reach the games, and therefore a lot of the story is lost. This rushed first hour forces a sense of mild confusion onto the spectator, as we are unsure of the significance of multiple characters and symbols that only fans can relate too. The camera-work of the opening twenty minutes before Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is swept away to the capitol is fantastic. The uncomfortable camera angles followed by quick cuts or jump cuts create a sense of fear and uneasiness. This same effect is used when the games finally get underway to emphasise the violence that is taking place, without focus on the blood and gore. However the games also drag on for another hour. Many of the scenes within this section feel overextended and a few of them unneeded. Surprisingly, in the last twenty minutes of the film it increases pace and enjoyment before rushing through the final few scenes, in order to reach the two hour mark.For an expensive and high grossing blockbuster one would expect the CGI to be believable and realistic, which in majority they are. But in one scene in particular where Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are arriving on chariot into the capitol, they are both wearing suits that are supposedly on fire. Whether it is the audience superimposed onto the green screen behind them, or the fire that doesn't even look like fire, this scene was sickening to watch in what was otherwise a beautiful and creative film.Acting-wise, Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks exceeded my expectations as they provided a surrogate mother and father, to an extent, for Katniss and Peeta. The characters presented in The Hunger Games are all very different as they have individual traits. Unfortunately because of these differences there is almost no attachment created between the audience and the characters, except perhaps Katniss as she is the protagonist. However due to her cold nature and bland facial expressions Katniss is also not entirely relatable to.When a film mentions its own title almost every minute it is never a good sign and The Hunger Games was no exception. The lack initiative or common sense used by the majority of the characters throughout the games is heavily frustrating – look out for the tree scene or a scene with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Many characters are introduced and then forgotten, which can only be preparation for a sequel, a flaw that The Lord of the Rings trilogy managed to avoid. All in all The Hunger Games was an enjoyable watch with many avoidable flaws. Perhaps its sequel will be more entertaininghttp://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",6,0,5,15 April 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn Review
","After hyping myself up for The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn last night I went into the film with high hopes, as I enjoyed the old cartoon series. I won't say I was disappointed but it didn't meet my expectations. The most disappointing part for me was the soundtrack. Whenever the tempo began to increase, it would then just drop never quite achieving an emotional response from me. When the rest of the film resembles classics like the Indiana Jones trilogy, it is understandable why the audio track let me down. The plot was very similar to the cartoon episodes, The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn, which the film was based on. For obvious reasons these episodes had to be combined so for the film to flow properly. As is any movie based on a TV show, comic or book; there are also many scenes that have been cut and plenty of new scenes and stories added for the plot to make a little more sense. But like I said, a large number of movie adaptations do this and so I won't dwell on the altered plot too long. Soundtrack, and plot, aside this film was still enjoyable to watch; perhaps even more so I you're a child watching for the very first time. The aspect of the film that made it so enjoyable was not the plot, soundtrack or even visuals, which were as fantastic as expected thanks to the technology of motion capture. But the characters themselves are what made this film. Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) was fantastic, we saw him angry, loyal, worried and most importantly drunk. They stuck very close to his character from the cartoons, and comics, as you'd hope Spielberg would. Jamie Bell, or Billy Elliot as may of us know him, gave us the character of Tintin. Unfortunately Tintin was a little emotionless throughout the film and the voice acting wasn't perfect, but even this is easily forgotten when Inspector Thompson (Simon Pegg) and Inspector Thomson (Nick Frost) are on the screen. These two characters are as precise to the comics and cartoons as they could be. When they are on screen the audience cannot help but have a grin on their face and laugh at the simplest of slapstick comedy. But to say that they are the highlight of the film puts Daniel Craig to shame. As Daniel Craig is well known for Bond I, and others, often criticise his acting ability. But when he provides such a slimy villain as Sakharine I am forced but to give him credit for his acting. Absolutely nothing about this character resembles Craig in anyway; be it look, motion or sound. Craig has done an improbable job providing The Adventures of Tintin with a dastardly villain. Finally I have to write a brief note about the look of the film. Now it doesn't look like the Tintin comics or cartoon (i.e. Hand-drawn) but I had never expected it to in this day and age. The characters all look like the cartoon version of themselves but 3D computer models instead. Thompson and Thomson have to be once again referenced as they look as similar to their cartoon counterparts as they possibly could do, whereas Tintin seems a little too lifelike in this world of big nosed, squinty eyed characters. The motion capture animation makes the film very lifelike and is likely to be the future for all forms of animation eventually. To summarise this film, although it doesn't meet all expectations, it is still very much a Tintin movie. We get the enjoyable relationship of the two protagonists (and snowy), as well as the slapstick, comedic breaks of Thompson and Thomson, and the villainous Sakharine. The film feels like a children's Indiana Jones movie, as one would expect and it is only let down by an unfulfilling soundtrack and a slightly predictable plot. All in all The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is well worth a watch, if not just for the nostalgia.http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",5,5,11,27 October 2011
21 Jump Street," Not the funniest film ever, but it was still enjoyable
","One thing I have to say before actually reviewing the film was how terrible the screening was at the cinema. It was possibly one of the worst cinema experiences of my life. After the 20 minutes of adverts and trailers the room darkened and the screen widened, the film was going to start. Then however, the cinema decided to play the trailer for 21 Jump Street (Dir. Phil Lord & Chris Miller, 2012) just before the screening of 21 Jump Street. It completely ruined the film for me as the trailer contained many of the early gags of the film.Since the hit that was Superbad (Dir. Greg Mottola) in 2007, the comedy genre has been redefined with dark and sick humour taking forefront within films, with slapstick having surprisingly made a comeback as well. 21 Jump Street does not falter from the new codes and conventions established by Superbad, probably because Jonah Hill had a lot of creative control in both movies.The plot of this film is simple. Two kids that hated each other in school both join the police force and become best friends. Unfortunately they are such bad cops they get initiated into a revived program on 21 Jump Street, and a forced to go undercover as high school kids. This sounds like a very cheesy 80s plot that won't work. But it does. They updated it enough to connect to a 2012 audience, while at the same time keeping the cheesiness that defined 80s comedy.Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street was pretty much Hill in every other film we have seen him in. I have to say, in some of is earlier movies I found his improvisation comedy refreshing and hilarious. Now, however, his jokes really haven't changed and his comedic style is becoming a little tedious, which is a shame. The real comedy star in this film was Channing Tatum, who actually fitted into this role with ease. I am hoping that his ability will improve with experience as he is a genuinely enjoyable screen presence.Some of the scenes are hilarious in this film. Notably a scene where they are both attempting to get drugs out of their system I found particularly funny. However, like many comedies nowadays, there are also some very unfunny scenes. I do not enjoy slapstick jokes in the slightest and I just do not enjoy films that rely on that form of comedy. I understand it exists to allow people to not think while watching the film and just to laugh, but I feel like it is a dated and child-like comedic form, and I much prefer intertextual jokes and witty dialogue.21 Jump Street is better than I thought it would be, but is not at the same comedic level as other hits like Superbad or The Hangover (Dir. Todd Philips, 2009). This film utilizes many forms of comedy, most probably to attract as bigger audience as possible; which is has. The acting is as it should be in a comedy film, apart from a cameo near the end which was mind-blowingly fantastic. 21 Jump Street has been a success as it has stuck to what people between the ages of 15-25 enjoy, which includes me. It was not the funniest film I have ever seen, but it was certainly not the least funny either.http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com",7,2,6,21 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Review
","The Swedish original of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Dir. David Fincher, 2011), Män som hatar kvinnor (Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009), methodically followed the plot created by Stieg Larsson to almost the exact word. This Hollywood remake did choose to leave out a few scenes that had been included within the original, but with the film already stretching at 2 hours 45 minutes I can forgive Fincher, as a fan of the novel, for cutting out some of the final scenes from the film. The most unusual and off-putting part about the whole film were the opening titles. They used a very James Bond-esc animation style where both Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) are born from oil. Thankfully, the heavy metal soundtrack accompanying the animation appeared to be the sort of music the character of Lisbeth would enjoy. My opinion of the film was redeemed, as for a brief second I had feared that Hollywood producers had taken control of the film and created an action filled mystery; this was not the case. Every single actor within The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo created individuals so similar to my imagination of the characters within Larsson's book that the film almost became a visual playback of my mind when reading the novel. Daniel Craig played an excellent Mikael Blomkvist but was unfortunately the only person who wasn't seemingly putting on a Swedish accent. The lack of accent wasn't that noticeable but it did make me raise questions as to Mikael Blomkvist's origin. Rooney Mara, in her protagonist debut, portrayed the girl with the dragon tattoo with such charisma that any problems I'd had with Daniel Craig's character were forgotten while she was on screen. David Fincher doesn't always produce films of a high standard, but this one is one of his greats. This movie has unusual protagonists, detestable villains and a mystery that keeps people who haven't read the book gripped till the end. The only warning I have for anyone watching this film who knows nothing about it is that it does include multiple uncomfortable scenes where at least one of the protagonists finds themselves in a situation which is difficult to watch. These said scenes are extremely well edited in Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They are abridged in such a way to make any of the grotesque scenes within the film more foreboding and uncomfortable. As an example, the first one of these scenes cuts between Lisbeth and her guardian in his bedroom, and a slow backwards zoom away from the door and down the corridor, making the scene more ominous than it already was. Finally, the film does extend to 2 hours and 45 minutes. For someone who enjoyed the novel it wasn't quite long enough as the final scenes within Australia have been cut to reduce time. But, I have been told, that for someone fresh to the franchise the film does last too long, as after the main plot has ended the film stretches on for 20 minutes into a detailed conclusion, similar to the book. In conclusion, this film was definitely better than the Swedish original as it had more personality, fantastic editing and a strong cast. Many will question whether there was a need for a Hollywood remake at all; and while the answer is no, I still believe that when watching this film it provides a more Swedish vibe than the Swedish one itself. The intoxicating acting of Rooney Mara keeps one engaged throughout the whole film, and despite the accent, this film has widened my eyes to the acting ability of Daniel Craig.",10,4,8,22 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Dale Lawson's Rise of the Planet of the Apes Review
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes (Rupert Wyatt, 2011) had a lot to live up to after the success of the original saga in the 70s. In my opinion it lived up to the reputation of its predecessor; unlike Tim Burton's adaptation as many people believe. Rise of the Planet of the Apes follows the character of Will Rodman (James Franco) as he attempts to create a drug that has the ability to cure Alzheimer's. By testing this drug on apes it improves their intelligence and Will is forced to take a baby monkey, Caesar (Andy Serkis), home after an unfortunate accident at the lab. The film then continues to follow Will and Caesar's relationship until the inevitable rise of the apes. Many of the actors' performances in this film are unbelievable. Andy Serkis, king of monkey motion capture stars as Caesar, the eventual leader of the ape rebellion. He has outdone himself once again as he behaves, through facial expressions and body movements, just like a chimpanzee. Without letting Serkis take all the glory, the other motion capture actors provided thoroughly life-like apes for the film. Through their believable performances we are lead to believe from the start of the film that they are in-fact real apes acting alongside James Franco. Franco's acting is as respectable as always, even more so in this film as he faced the difficulty of acting alongside Serkis, and many others, in a motion capture suits. The one actor that deserves recognition is John Lithgow, who gave an emotional and worryingly realistic portrayal of a father with Alzheimer's disease. Finally Tom Felton, who we all know as Draco Malfoy, featured in his first film since the end of the Harry Potter franchise. Throughout the movie he delivers lines that had been said by Charlton Heston in the original Ape films, and although not doing these quotes justice he still presents the audience with a dislikeable antagonist.This movie's plot is a massive talking point for Planet of the Apes (Franklin J. Schaffer, 1968) fans as this is the first Ape film to alter the plots created by the originals. Instead of apes travelling from the future back to the past and giving birth to Caesar, he is created through scientific accidents and experiments. This take on the story, although controversial, makes sense in this modern age; as we are no longer scared of space travel; the main fear held by humanity is that of disease. One of the things that stood out in this exciting movie was the epic soundtrack written by Patrick Doyle, who composed Thor's (Kenneth Branagh, 2011) soundtrack. This soundtrack is one of the best, if not the best I've heard this year and finished the film on a fantastic, adrenaline fuelled high. Finally, I'll briefly mention the graphics and special effects used. Obviously, being a summer blockbuster it was going to have to have motion captured apes, rather than the other two options, of real chimpanzees or men dressed as monkeys, like the originals used. However they went one step further with this film, using the same motion capturing experts that did Avatar (James Cameron, 2009) and King Kong (Peter Jackson, 2005) to help create life-like, well textured and expressive apes. In summary, I really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes as it took a fresh twist on the Planet of the Apes story. Was this remake needed though? Probably not. But the fact still stands that I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. The acting skills of Andy Serkis and John Lithgow were phenomenal, Patrick Doyle's soundtrack outstanding and the motion captured apes story for freedom unpredictably entertaining. http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",8,1,3,16 December 2011
The Artist," Great homage to the silent era, gripping narrative and fantastic use of sound, when it is used
","The Artist (Dir. Michel Hazanavicius, 2011) focuses on the career of a silent film star and his transition into the classical Hollywood era where 'talkies' dominate. His career is contended by the incredible performances of a new star, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). The film progresses, following her rise and his demise.The Artist is colourless and silent which can be off-putting for the generic film going audience who would prefer to watch another Transformer film. The story is an interesting one and pays great homage to the films of the silent era. Through the lack of sound I became more engaged with the plot and characters of The Artist as there were no conversations or sound effects to distract ones eye or ear from the films narrative. When watching it, comparisons between The Artist and Singin' in the Rain (Dir. Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1952) cannot be overlooked. They both contain very similar narratives, where one actor is forced out by 'talkies' while another succeeds.Unlike silent movies from the early 20th century, this film does incorporate scenes of sound within in the film. Counting it up after watching the film I believe there are in-fact only two scenes in the whole hour and a half that use diegetic sound. One scene occurs early in the film where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the film's protagonist, suffers a nightmare on how he won't cope with the transition to sound. This scene is superbly produced. All the objects Valentin contacts with, in the dream, make sounds as he interacts with them, but he himself cannot speak. This scene is hauntingly spectacular as the footage that precedes and follows this scene is silent and accompanied but a music hall soundtrack. This nightmare scene, however, has no soundtrack and only the diegetic sound of the objects Valentin touches.The camera work and editing techniques are similar to that of film- making in the 1920s. Modern techniques are, however, used within The Artist as well. At multiple points newspaper headlines are layered onto the film so as to provide more of a narrative. These techniques were used in early cinema, but not to the extent or effect that they are in The Artist. As I mentioned before, this film pays a great homage to the classics created by the first film-makers.Another noteworthy aspect of this film is the acting. For a French film there is a large number of popular American faces. This will be due to the film being set in the United States. Actors John Goodman and James Cromwell play producer Al Zimmer and Valentin's butler. These actors are fantastic, along with the previous mentioned Dujardin and Bejo, and create an unforgettable film. Another actor that needs recognition is Valentin's dog. It is one of the most important characters in the film and also provides great comic relief; the inter-titles near the end of the film states that Valentin 'owes his life to that dog', referring to a house fire. But subtly I think the inter-titles are implying that the dog helped make Valentin's career.The idea of silent films is often off-putting for a generic film audience, as mentioned. But this film should seriously be considered for anyone who enjoys a good film. I also heavily recommend viewing it at the pictures as cinema is the medium films like this are intended for.

The Woman in Black," Best horror film in ages!
","The thing that is in everyone's mind when Daniel Radcliffe first appears on screen is Harry Potter! I personally think that Radcliffe has one of the hardest challenges an actor can ever face, which is trying to get out of being typecast, or perhaps never being cast at all because of his huge involvement in the Potter franchise. But I am pleased to say that he excelled in The Woman in Black (Dir. James Watkins, 2012), providing a believable performance as Arthur Kipps. Only at the beginning did his act falter; as Radcliffe seemed nervous around the boy who was supposed to be his son.I'll briefly mention that this film flows particularly well, and gives off a high degree of verisimilitude, thanks to the talented supporting cast. Ciarán Hinds and Shaun Dooley are two actors that are worth mentioning as they play Mr Daily, a character who becomes the only friend for Kipps, and Mr Fisher, the innkeeper who attempts to drive Kipps out of town so as to protect the children. Both their performances are strong and they create a fantastic side-kick and a great minor antagonist.Apart from what I had gathered from the trailers, I was unaware of the story of The Woman in Black when going into the cinema, having not seen the theatrical production or original TV film. The Woman in Black has a strong and interesting narrative, something that isn't common for many horror films within the last ten years, and provides plenty of scares, jumps and horrific moments. The most intense and captivating scenes within the film occur at the manor in the marsh. Fear excels to a new level when Kipps decides to stay in that house over night.Creepy toys and terrifying dolls are continuously visible throughout The Woman in Black establishing a strong concept of fear within the secrete village. As well as perhaps symbolising that the woman is always watching Kipps, no matter where he is. There is a shot where Kipps walks past a toy with a candle, the candle is reflected in the toy's eyes making it seem like they are moving and following Kipps.The only really disappointing aspect of the film was the conclusion. All I can really say without spoiling the plot is that there should have been a cliff hanger instead of the plot being resolved.This was by far the best horror film I have seen in a long while, mainly due to the decision not to make it a hand-held documentary. The director uses diegetic and non-diegetic sounds to create suspense, which again takes the film away from the silent 'jump' scenes over-used in modern horrors. I hope that more producers watch this film and realise horror films don't all have to be exactly like Paranormal Activity (Dir. Oren Peli, 2007) to terrify audiences.If you enjoyed this review, check out my others on my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",8,1,3,17 February 2012
