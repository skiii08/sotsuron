10 Cloverfield Lane," Claustrophobic Fun
","What if you were in a car accident, and your rescuer was a crazy doomsday prepper, and it's officially doomsday? Well, you get this, a tight, claustrophobic and altogether freaky dynamic between a makeshift family that surely features at least one creepy secret. Settings like these are rife for creating character tension, and that is done quite successfully. We get our nice lull, where it seems everything is going to be fine, until the secret is exposed and Michelle and Emmett make their choices to push through the third act.All three primary cast members are terrific, and the tension between them is very real. John Goodman is especially outstanding with Howard's increasingly bizarre behavior, and insistence that he be treated a certain way. And the mystery surrounding what went on outside never quite abates, and is put up as something that we, the audience, must know at some point. The nuance weaves through the interactions between the characters, and we are left to wait for the other shoe to drop, and when it does, the conclusion is a fantastic payoff.",9,0,0,14 October 2017
Detroit," Don't believe in white privilege?
","Don't believe? Don't think that racially motivated police violence is a thing? Then open your eyes and see this movie. White cops terrorizing black civilians has been a problem for decades, not just with Rodney King, not just the incidents that have flooded social media since Trayvon Martin. This sort of thing is embedded in America's history.I am a native of Detroit, and even I had never understood the severity of this incident, and the depths of racism within the Detroit Police Department back then. Real life incidents in the modern south mirror exactly this sort of situation. Each of the officers involved in this situation was acquitted multiple times, and walk free to this day.Is that justice? In many ways, the timeliness of this movie makes these modern incidents impossible to ignore in a discussion of what it depicts. Justice is not seen for victims. They suffer and die and have no recourse.And as is seen in this film, there are no heroes. There's nobody standing up for the victims in the Algiers. There's nobody walking in to save them from the oppression they're facing. There's only the cops wielding their power with impunity, vengeance ahead of justice. Anthony Mackie and John Boyega play two tremendous pop-culture heroes, but neither one of them is rising up to stop the madness in this film, because it didn't happen. Only other situations saved these people from further embarrassment, injury and death.The film is buoyed by amazing performances from its principal actors, and under Bigelow's stark, realistic direction, we can see the gritty hours of danger that these people lived through, and can empathize with those who had to endure it.It is a hard film, a difficult subject to tackle for a crew, and even for the audience to watch, as it is easy to become uncomfortable watching these events, knowing they really happened. It is almost like watching the SS terrorizing Jews in Nazi Germany. But it is a viewing that should be undertaken, because the understanding and clarity that a viewer can get out of it can change a person's entire perspective on race and police violence.Will this movie change he country? Probably not. But if it opens even a few eyes to what our society is and has been, its job will be done.",10,7,20,4 December 2017
Aquaman," Delightfully Fun
","Well, they managed to make Aquaman cool.I don't say that lightly, either. The superhero with the odds-on worst reputation of all has been redeemed by a talented leading man and a sound director. James Wan's work with this script managed to blend high action, character development, and tremendous visuals, with a smattering of utter ridiculousness for good measure.Jason Momoa is the star, but Amber Heard cannot be overlooked, as her character is the one that drives the plot, and not as the love interest. Wan did his homework, and ensured that Mera was more than eye candy or a damsel in distress. She is a butt-kicker, and more intuitive than Arthur is for most of the movie.Arthur is done consistently with what we got of him in Justice League, but fleshed out more, and Momoa is up to the challenge of doing more with a guy who to this point had been a hard drinking nobody who could fire off the occasional wisecrack. The backstory he is given is less tragic than many other superheroes tend to get, complete with one guaranteed living parent. Kind of an odd fact in this genre.Patrick Wilson is definitely committed as the would-be Ocean Master, and brings a hammy gravitas to the role, as though he understands how ridiculous he is and plays it up at every opportunity. This should make him cheesy, but instead it makes him more distasteful, adding to the strength of the performance.Black Manta is another good choice, and his part in the film is helpful at moving the plot along, and bringing more action. His anger, and unfettered rage for revenge makes him a good, gritty villain to counterbalance the others.The action is fantastic, and the scale on which it is done in many scenes is great. But at no point do you lose track of Arthur or Mera as they get through it all.Like Wonder Woman, this is an example of what the DCEU can be when it is given to directors and writers who are of quality, and there's less Zack Snyder.",10,3,5,26 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Perfect Follow-Up
","I never thought there would ever be one Deadpool movie, let alone two. The first was a piece of utter brilliance made on a shoestring budget (comparatively) that blew up a lot of convention with its success.This gave way to the sequel we have before us. The ability was now given to do Deadpool without unnecessary budget constraints. Would the change of directors matter? Short answer, no. Long answer noooooooooooooooooooo. David Leitch steps in and earns his opening sequence credit mention (you'll see), and throws us a Deadpool that is another epic romp of hilarity and action.As before, the soundtrack is a great co-star to the movie, giving lift to the moments where Ryan Reynolds' DP is at his funniest or his deepest. And DP does have to find some depth within himself as he moves through the film in order to carry it forward.
Some observations:Every scene with Blind Al is brilliant. The interactions between her and Deadpool are hilarious, and there's a scene further on with the two of them that may leave you in need of a paper bag from all the hyperventilating you'll be doing on account of laughing so hard.Josh Brolin gets Cable down perfectly, and this guy does not get nearly enough credit for his skill as an actor. Not everyone could make Thanos likable and Cable awesome within the same month, but he has done it.Zazie Beetz is your show-stealer. She makes a great Domino, and her rapport with Reynolds is obvious.Peter! X-Force!
There's a lot of great stuff happening here, and this is the perfect Deadpool sequel. I laughed the entire time, and I can't wait to watch it again so I can really start quoting it.",10,4,8,21 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," No hammer? No problem.
","Thor's reliance on mythological constructs is always a part of the draw for a fan of myth like myself, but also vexing because liberties are usually taken, and not always for the better. In this case, Hela(Hel in Norse mythology) has her background rewritten, but in this way it works, as it shows Odin's past, a past that is much more in line with his mythological self.That said, half the fun of Thor movies is Loki. I will never get tired of Tom Hiddleston in that role, and the rapport between he and Thor remains as great as it ever was. Thor also has a great few minutes with Dr. Strange, as teased at the end of that movie. It seems that each encounter with each different character brings a different level of snark from Thor that hasn't been as present in previous installments, and this makes him much more engaging and entertaining than he had been before. He trades jokes with fire demons, Hulk, Valkyrie, Loki, and anybody else he runs into.This movie is a lot of fun. For how serious the subject of Ragnarok is for Asgardians, they manage to have a good time with it. Cate Blanchett brings a great over the top touch to Hela, going so far as to give her a wit at times, and manages to separate her a bit from the rudimentary MCU villains.Marvel continues to make superhero films that are as fun as they are serious, and as such provides that truly engaging movie experience, reminding us that it's okay that The Grandmaster is a goofball, or that there's a guy made of rocks that's as soft spoken as they come. In the end, we get what we come for: The heroes do battle with a powerful villain throughout, summoning great courage and special effects to deliver a great time for all. And now, it's nearly time for the Infinity War. Stay tuned.",10,10,20,6 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Best Spidey to Date
","Spider-Man, at his core, is the original kid superhero. His innocence and naivete are as important as his intellect and wit. After two previous incarnations and five movies, it's this version that finally puts together a truly faithful portrayal of Peter Parker. Fittingly, it took the MCU to do it. Tom Holland eschews the portrayals of his predecessors, and infuses Parker with a genuinely optimistic view of the world, and almost a boy crush on Tony Stark. Peter is awkward, nervous and ambitious, to the point where he nearly wrecks himself in order to show Stark how useful he can be. There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie, be it through Spidey's quips, his amusing interactions with people, or just times where he falls flat while trying to be this great superhero. Peter's classmates get a fair bit more work; this is the most complete Flash ever put to film, and Ned is a perfect best friend for Peter. It's a fast movie as well, and Michael Keaton helps keep that going as the counterbalance, his career renaissance continuing in excellent fashion. Vulture is not the most headline-grabbing Spidey villain, certainly, but neither was Obediah Stane for Iron Man, nor Abomination for Hulk. They worked well because of who portrayed them, and this is another case of that working in the favor of the story. Keaton's motivations are simple, but not the same as a typical villain, which makes him stand out, and potentially shows that the MCU can create guys who are more than one-trick ponies. This movie paces itself well, and just when you think it's safe, it pulls a sharp right on you to bring the final act into focus. There's just enough Tony Stark to bolster the bottom line, without having him take over the film. He's the dad, such as it is, who'd have thought? Iron Man is the interweaving thread in this universe, so it's appropriate he be here, and the aforementioned dad role is amusing and in a way the perfect method to bring Spidey along. Overall, a great time. The stakes aren't as high as they're going to be or have been in MCU movies, but that's okay. Spidey just needs to keep his feet on the ground.",10,270,513,9 July 2017
Pacific Rim," Nothing Unexpected
","This movie is exactly what it sets itself up as; giant robots versus monsters. Said creatures are built in the vein of Godzilla, in that you can basically tell they're rubber in the more close-up fight scenes. The robots are nicely designed, and the action scenes have solid pacing and fun to them.That said, the plot is rather thin, which is almost a shock considering how long it takes to get going. Idris Elba's character is the most interesting, but still is a basket of tropes that doesn't go much of anywhere. The real highlight is Ron Perlman, who is the smartest character in the film. That's not a high bar to clear, but he is ahead of the game for the most part, and is a fun presence that lends some comic aspects that the film needs.But mostly this involves people inside of cockpits screaming at each other about finishing things and killing things. If that's what your game is, this is your film. It's fancy, its creatures are imaginatively designed, but it's not something that's going to give you a lot to take home with you. Its drama is only skin deep, and its character development doesn't really happen, and it drags on far too long.",5,0,1,25 November 2018
Justice League," Comes Together Nicely
","I don't see what the problem is.While this movie would have benefited from more buildup, maybe a solo Flash, Cyborg, and/or Aquaman movie, when taken for what it is, it's a solid success. It's a team build on the same scale as the Avengers, just without the added benefit of backstory.Going in, my thought was that Aquaman was going to steal the show, but that honor goes to the Flash. Ezra Miller offers a different take on Barry Allen from the Grant Gustin version, and it works well within the team's dynamic. Every scene he is in is better for him being there, and his wide-eyed viewing of many of the events he is privy to adds a comedic element that could have easily been overlooked.And once again, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is the star of the show. She holds the entire movie together on her own, and while Batman is the one whose brainchild the team is, she is truly the driving force, and the character with the most happening as the film develops. Gadot came right out of the solo movie and into this one without missing a beat, and that makes it all the better.Joss Whedon's hands are all over this thing. Fans of his work will notice his style, particularly the snappy and funny dialogue, and he does a lot to overshadow Snyder, and pull the movie away from his clutch into something that is more enjoyable and lighter than Batman v. Superman, even though the stakes are infinitely higher.Steppenwolf is well realized, though perhaps not the ideal villain for this scenario. He is clearly a precursor to the inevitable arrival of Darkseid, a stronger, more complex character that is also pure evil. The film gets a bit bogged down in the Mother Box piece, and they almost feel like a MacGuffin of the highest order, but their utilization toes that line, rather than outright jumping over it.The film is a great deal of fun. After two of the previous installments in the DCEU were more or less duds with minimal humor, and a rush job to get this universe established, the League finally arrives together on screen with aplomb, and in far more entertaining fashion than it would have if DC hadn't pivoted and allowed humor to be a part of it. Though I will say that Batman making even one joke is a little odd.9/10. Don't listen to the critics on this one.",8,1,4,19 November 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," A ride like no other
","I feel like I just gave birth to a Thanos-sized baby.I have been physically and emotionally drained by this movie from start to finish, as it starts with an intense sense of foreboding, and carries that throughout the entire rest of the film. This is edge-of-your-seat excitement, and it is not hyperbole to say so. Around every corner is something dangerous and unpredictable, and for all the scenes that feature so many of the heroes Marvel has cultivated over the last decade, it never feels cluttered.The Russos carefully pace the introductions and the separation of scenes, never feeling like our stay with a certain group of heroes is too long or too short. We have come a long way to get here, and in doing so, we are not cheated in any way by how the story unfolds.Josh Brolin's Thanos is the real star of the movie. A background villain, ever looming in the shadows and on the horizon, he finally gets his moment, and garners ample screen time and development, unlike so many villains before him. His motives are laid out in an expert sort of way, much like Killmonger's in Black Panther, and it creates a richer experience. Thanos relies on Brolin's capabilities as an actor to become real, and Brolin is more than up to the challenge.The visuals on Thanos are remarkable as well; every subtle facial tick and reaction is intensely detailed, and incredibly realistic. That sort of skill elevates the product as a whole, immersing the audience in its world seamlessly.And then there's that ending. Oh, we must talk about that ending. There have been none like it, and the reactions in the theater when you see it will be unlike any you've ever had in a Marvel movie before. The Russos took some big chances, brought together the universe that so many before them have built, and blasted the whole thing into space for one two and-a-half hour thrill ride, with another installment to come.Is it May 2019 yet?",10,9,24,30 April 2018
Get Out," Nothing is what it appears
","This film is so much more than your standard horror movie. If anything, it's much more a suspense movie with a devious twist. The plot is simple enough at first, girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family. Sure, basic enough. But Jordan Peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic.The interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable, and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughter's black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily. What Peele does is merge those two, and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringe-worthy no matter what race you may be. If you're white, the white people are embarrassing you. If you're black, you're feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this, and wondering if there isn't something underneath the apparent good words.In that way, Peele encapsulates our society. White people invoking Barack Obama's name as though it gives them credibility among black people, for instance. Through each scene, you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop, and wonder what exactly it means when it happens.When it does, the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno, and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo. Peele has, as such, built a perfectly frightening movie, and with its deep societal roots, it is intelligent, and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place.The acting is stupendous, and the twists are crazy good. The comic relief that Rod provides as a goofy TSA agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that Peele is, but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of Chris's plight.10/10. See this movie and see it often.",10,15,29,4 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rey's parents are...now a matter of record.
","Two years after The Force Awakens rocked the sleeping giant to life, and left audiences with so many questions and so few answers, the franchise fell into the lap of Rian Johnson. As a director known to not be afraid to take risks, this second installment in the new trilogy proves his pedigree.This is a daring, emotional, nuanced entry in the saga that rises to the levels of its greatest forebears, bringing drama and action at high levels throughout. Surprise after surprise litters the landscape, as every time you think you can breathe, something else happens to bash you back into the thick of the story.The new Big Three of Star Wars bring their A game from the outset, and as the film progresses, it is easy to see which one falls into the role of Luke, Han, and Leia from the original trilogy.On the subject of Leia, watching Carrie Fisher's final performance is an emotional journey. Those of us who have been with her since A New Hope will doubtlessly feel a greater connection to her character, and an emotional tug each time she is on screen. This should not distract from how good she is even without that caveat. She is as always a pleasure to watch, and it is truly sad that there will be no further films from her. As for her on-screen brother, Mark Hamill remains terrific in anything he is in, and plays Luke in a way that he never has before, elevating the character to further legendary levels.This film has met and surpassed any expectations, bringing the great Star Wars formula to new heights; fun, action, weird new creatures and beautiful new worlds, humor, and dramatic girth. it is eminently quotable, a visual feast, and a satisfying experience.",10,3,14,15 December 2017
Selma," Brave Example
","The important thing about historical films is that they show us things that we may not have seen. The Selma march is a key part of Dr. King's legacy, and was instrumental in getting the Voting Rights Act passed, a law that stood untouched for nearly fifty years until its key enforcement clauses were knocked down by the Supreme Court.Director Ava DuVernay has successfully captured the mood of all parties directly affected by the stirrings happening in Selma. David Oyelowo gives a stirring performance as Dr. King, and Tom Wilkinson is quite capable as LBJ. It is easy to feel the reverberations when these two powerful, intelligent men clashed over when and how to give African Americans unimpeded access to the vote while people were beaten and murdered in the streets by angry rednecks.In a time now where protesting has become much more common, and the people of this country are divided over many issues, a film like this is deeply important, because it reminds us of just how we can come together and overcome the ingrained problems of this country to forge a better future. Segregation and racism was so rooted in the south then, and it is truly not that much better now, but intelligent people stood together, made plans, and stuck to their guns. It is a road map for all who wish to evoke social change in this country, and it is a remarkable achievement in film to give us such an unfiltered look into how it all went down.We've come a long way, but still have so far to go.",9,0,1,1 September 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Better and Better
","Marvel characters have daddy issues; Be it Iron Man, Thor, Loki, Betsy Ross, or numerous others. Star-Lord, however, has the grandest daddy issues of all. Between Yondu, his surrogate father, and Ego, his real father, he's got his share of problems. The rest of his team have family issues as well, and director James Gunn manages to work on each of them. In the process, he deftly sidesteps the issues that have plagued previous MCU sequels, while also reminding us of the menace that is Thanos which lurks just off-screen despite not launching the plot of this film into a larger tie-in with the rest of the MCU.The movie is fun, funny, and whenever Baby Groot is around, simply adorable. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and helps elevate the overall product even more. Gunn is already locked into continuing the series in its third installment, and Marvel would be wise to keep him and this crew together for as long as possible.",10,23,40,9 May 2017
The Disaster Artist," Fascinating and Funny Insight
","So going in, I've seen The Room. I've also seen the Rifftrax version, which is one of the best riffs on a film I've ever seen. The fascination with this film was something I'd heard about for a long time, and I'd missed out on Rifftrax live versions for quite some time before I finally got a watch in. Now, I've been able to view the Disaster Artist, and find out how a fascinating piece of cinema history came to be.And it's really difficult to use a different word to describe it. Tommy Wiseau is a strange bird, so unlike anyone else in the film industry, and perhaps life in general. Nobody knows who he is or where he came from, or why he's so loaded. And yet, he creates this bizarre masterpiece that becomes a cult phenomenon on account of its sheer awfulness.The overacting, missing or derailed plot threads, strange dialogue, and general cluelessness made the original movie quite the sight to behold. It is like a vanity project for someone who hasn't earned that vanity. And James Franco's spot-on portrayal of Wiseau shows this evocateur to be quite the odd duck with strange habits, and an intriguing charisma that allowed him to take his friend on this journey and successfully make and distribute a film, a thing many people only ever dream of.James Franco did a tremendous job of recreating the scenes from The Room, and bringing Wiseau's personality to life. No matter what he may or may not have done in the real world, he brought his A game to this project and made it very memorable.",9,1,2,24 April 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonderful
","Wonder Woman may possibly be the greatest superhero movie ever produced. There, I said it. The challenge before Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot was a formidable one; bring the legendary superhero to life on the big screen for her first solo adventure, and do it in such a way that it blows away the ridiculous conventions that have long dogged female-fronted superhero films. Even Marvel, as progressive as they are, shied away from giving Scarlett Johansson a chance to fly solo as the popular and complex Black Widow. This is a pressure not easily handled, especially with the entire DC film universe to this point being largely disappointing in the eyes of critics, and divisive among audiences. DC needed a break, a fine film that could finally show that its universe could be every bit as good as Marvel's. Enter Gal Gadot. The decision to insert Wonder Woman into Batman vs. Superman, and get the mythical Trinity on the screen at the same time, was masterful. Gal Gadot was made for this role; tall, stunning, and naturally Mediterranean, as Diana should be. Add to that the single best entrance a superhero has ever made, complete with a guitar-licking theme, and audiences and critics alike reached agreement. No matter their thoughts on the overall film, she was a highlight. So, the torch was passed to Patty Jenkins for the titular origin story, and she ran with it. The implications of this film's success are well documented, and it finally does break through the fog of the other DC films. We see Diana, the secrecy of her birth in tow, grow to become the great warrior before leaving with Steve Trevor and entering World War I. Her innocence and naivete upon entering our world makes for a complex thread as she spends more and more time around man while seeking her quarry. She sees man's pain, suffering, and simple pleasures, and even despite her singular belief as to what must happen, she becomes emotionally grounded, which becomes key when the climax arrives. The big reveal is compelling, and Jenkins does a fantastic job at dangling lines out there before reeling it in with a terrific, if long, battle sequence. Gal Gadot has made a star turn here, and future Wonder Woman sequels are sure to happen, as this film delivers on all counts: Diana's relationship with Trevor is multifaceted, funny and interesting, and produces some truly touching moments. The action sequences are exciting and gloriously fun, and that moment when Diana casts aside her cloak and steps forth in her full armor the first time is mesmerizing. The DC Universe now has its first truly great film. Ball's in your court, Marvel.",10,13,29,4 June 2017
Black Panther," Best MCU Film Yet
","A common thread in Marvel films has been how past actions, before the hero has his power, come back around to present consequences. Black Panther is no exception. In the same way that Tony Stark's behavior when he was a party boy caused him problems many years later, T'Challa's fathers decisions from his youth have reprecussions on his son's, and country's, future.Wakanda presents itself as practically a utopia, as its citizens have built incredibly upon its supply of Vibranium and the skills of its warrior kings. We see T'Challa ascend the throne, as we expected after the events of Civil War, and the challenges that come along with such a role.While Chadwick Boseman is a strong, capable lead who creates a sympathetic and intriguing lead character, the true stars of this film for my money are Shuri and Killmonger. Shuri isn't just the wiseguy support character that so many of the people that provide technical help to a hero is. She is a strong, vital woman in her own right who makes a difference in multiple ways, and is a pleasure to see appear on screen. Nakia and Okoye can also make these claims; they are also much stronger than many female characters are allowed to be, even within the MCU, and they too light up the screen and provide great support to the story.
Killmonger has been receiving a great deal of praise as the best MCU villain to date, and it's hard to disagree. His history is replete with violence and intellect, and he has found a way to combine those two to become a powerful force when he goes to settle his grudge. He speaks intelligently, with conviction, and with firm and complex ideas about what he intends to do. He does this all while initially seeming like an average American. Michael B. Jordan as such turns in easily the best performance of a villain this side of Loki, and elevates the film each time he is on screen.This is a more serious film from start to finish than most Marvel films lately; it is grounded, and while still flashing that trademark wit, and fun action set pieces that we've come to expect, its true strength is found between the lines with well-written characters and an interesting plot that can keep even the most casual Marvel fan transfixed.Now is the time to talk about the cultural impact of this movie. The convention of films with primarily African-American cast members being unreliable in box office terms is surely shattered now. This film has helped show those that would claim to be experts that it doesn't matter what color the skin of the cast is, if the movie is good, people will see it.There is so much black culture evident in the threads of this film, from its opening to its closing scenes, and even at least one of the post-credit scenes. The inescapable nature of trying to improve their lot in the world, and what role they should take, is woven throughout, and presents numerous conflicts that only serve to make the film as a whole even better. Ryan Coogler deserves all the praise he is getting for creating such a thematically strong film that transcends its genre while still managing to be a great part of it.Infinity War is coming soon, and following it and Avengers 4, it is sure that T'Challa and Wakanda will be a huge part of the next phase of the MCU. I, for one, am eager to see how things shake out, and will be ready to plant my butt in a seat for Black Panther 2, whenever it happens.",10,1,10,21 February 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," On with the body count
","Though the mystique of the character of John Wick is slid aside as this film goes, it is still about the slick violence and choreographed action sequences. After a very cringe-worthy scene early on, the film picks up and goes full force into the same kind of slick action that made the first one such fun to watch. Though it loses a little something by the number of people willing to take John Wick on despite his reputation, it is still a good, solid story. The network of killers is more revealed than in the first one, and we get a sense of the gravity of Wick's choices and the level of effect they have on him. There is clearly going to be a third film in this series, and given how this one ends, it will be a very interesting conclusion that will doubtlessly feature even more of the action we have come to love. But if someone would tell the main villain to avoid the monologue piece during a cat-and-mouse game, I'd appreciate it. 8/10",8,0,1,28 June 2017
