Requiem for a Dream," ideal drug education video, but so much more...
","I was told before i watched this that it would be the most depressing movie i'd ever seen. I don't know whether i agree that it was. I don't think i've ever felt quite so drained and harrowed after watching a film, and yes the events are 'depressing', but they are also the result of drugs, prescribed and recreational. This not so much depressed, but more seemed to warn and illustate to the viewer what can happen when you become addicted to drugs. The truth about what can happen may well be shocking and upsetting, and so it was good to see that the director decided to make the film shocking and upsetting, rather than gloss over it all. All four lead roles are superbly acted, and the camera work is classy and modern. As with most great films, the music really adds to it, the main theme being particularly intense.I enjoy films which leave me thinking about what happened, and i couldn't stop thinking about what happened in this movie - it was definitely one for stirring the emotions.",8,0,1,17 November 2003
Fight Club," The first rule of imdb is watch Fight Club.
","This film is quite simply superb. If you want to see truly scintillating acting performances from Ed Norton and Brad Pitt (and the rest), in a picture which is dripping with class, smoothness, philosophies, and so much more then this is for you. Don't be put off by the name - this film has much more to offer than fighting. Ok, there is some violence, but this is not the point of the movie atall. It simply has to be watched, if anything for the unpredictable, shiver-inducing twist. Not to be missed.",10,0,2,31 October 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Strangely amusing.
","I didn't live through the major events of the 60's, but i still appreciated the point this movie was trying to make. When movies can make a really good point using humour, but without the humour being offensive or seemingly inappropriate, then it is a success in my view. I particularly liked Seller's Mandrake role, he had some very funny scenes. I would recommend this to people of all ages, it's funny and makes you think.",7,3,7,17 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Violence violence violence, oh....and a story.
","I have given away the main feature of this film in the summary - violence. Ok, other Tarantino movies have been violent, and it would be naive to expect this latest offering to be as violence-free as a PG-rated cartoon flick, but it should not be the lasting memory of the movie. Perhaps i am missing the point of this movie, perhaps i was missing something - the plot seemed to be a simple case of revenge. Revenge exacted in a japanese style, which was reflected in the samurai sword massacreing of so many people. The effects are impressive - the anime sections are particularly well done, it really manages to make you move the emotions and make you cringe at the violence, which is impressive for what is essentially a cartoon section. The music, a vital part to most good movies, really makes this film for me - it is what makes it Tarantino. The music, mixing the old western stand-offs with the modern, makes up for the lack of really great lines - there were good ones, but no quotes of Pulp Fiction proportions. The lead role played by Uma Thurman could not have been played by anyone else - she is simply superb in the role, and Lucy Liu is impressive as a homicidal japanase-chinese-american samurai-sword-wielding mafia-esque leader. So was this a good movie?? Yes. It had essentially a plot which kept you interested, to the extent that i'm now eager to watch the second volume, and some great acting performances from the leads, with a fairly original section of anime (the crouching tiger hidden dragon moments weren't so impressive, for the obvious reason that they are now old-news). So why the emphasis on violence?? Ok, films are more violent these days, and this film to some extents needed to be this violent to succeed, otherwise this would be a fairly average film - the only problem i have with the level of violence is the way viewers seem to get de-sensitised to it, and even find it funny. I myself found it funny by the end. I just hope that there aren't people watching this movie and seeing that it makes people laugh who then decide to make their own comedy with their own violence. With more violence in movies comes the trust that people should be allowed to watch what they like, rather than censoring in case a few take it the wrong way and decide to imitate. Great film for the lads and gory-hunters, just don't take anyone with a weak stomach! I gave it 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,2 November 2003
Green Street Hooligans," Worth a watch...
","I thought this film was an interesting take on the darker side of football. It did make me empathise with the characters, and was well shot and acted. My one criticism was that at the end of the film I wasn't convinced by the lesson it was trying to teach. I thought it deserved a 7 out of 10 however because it was a relatively original subject, for me at least, and I was convinced by the acting. I thought I would find Elijah Wood annoying in the lead role, but he actually did a great job - definitely a good attempt to get away from the Frodo image!If you like football then I'd recommend watching this, and if you don't know anything about football do give it a go but please bear in mind that not all fans are like this!",7,0,0,1 May 2009
Mystic River," Intense slow burner, with a chilling plot, yet puzzling ending!
","The idea of this movie is fantastic. Three young boys meet again in adulthood when one of their daughters is murdered - one is the father, one is the detective, and one is the suspect, this film had all the makings of a great crime thriller. Sean Penn is thoroughly convincing as Jimmy and his scenes certainly stir up the greatest emotions, particularly the harrowing scene near the end with Robbins, on the shores of the 'Mystic River'. Bacon is typically good, not outstanding, but he does a good enough job. Laurence Fishbourne was rather wasted in this movie, i couldnt help thinking his part could have been played by any actor of semi-good calibre - it's hard to not think of him in his Matrix role. This movie had a lot to offer, and some good plot twists which you could only really predict near the end, but for some reason it seemed to drag - I put this down to the director. Eastwood seems to always go for the intense facial shots and never allow a moment to relax and prepare for the tension to come - it certainly wasn't the movie to take popcorn into! The tension was superbly done in the big scenes with the lead actors, particularly when Penn finds out his daughter is dead, but i felt a little more variation in tension would have made the film easier to watch. I struggle to think of the point the movie was trying to make. Here's my shot: it was saying that a man will do what he has to in order to protect his family, and this is the way they are brought up - hence the slightly disturbing conversation between Jimmy and his wife at the end. A slightly weak point to make in my opinion, and certainly one that you would not want to encourage. You leave the theatre feeling dissatisfied at the injustice of the movie. All that should not take away from the fact that it was certainly worth a watch, and it is a great plot, with some fine acting performances.",7,0,0,31 October 2003
