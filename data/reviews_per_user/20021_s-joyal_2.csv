Casablanca," Casablanca
","The acting was great in this film, Humphrey Bogart had an excellent performance with his role as the man who doesn't stick out his neck for anyone. It was great to find out just how many people he really would help in times of need. The way he would let people win in roulette was great. Michael Curtiz did a great job of having the audience feel as though they were at Casablanca at the time, that was done by great acting as well as scenery necessary to get the job done. Ingrid Bergman did an excellent job as well, her facial expressions and the way she spoke, she fit the role perfectly. She had an innocent tone to her voice which created more of a dramatic sequence to every scene she was in, it gave the sad and happy pieces to the film an extra boost of emotion which was great.",9,1,2,17 October 2012

","This film had me wanting to learn to dance like Gene Kelly, it's very interesting how the film showed the steps to make a film within it. The dance choreography was excellent. The scene when Donald O'Connor dances in the rain, a beautiful scene. Gene Kelly is unbelievably talented, never realized he was a director, along with being an incredible dancer and actor. The photographer did a great job at capturing the color within each scene, although the singing in the rain scene had little color, the color that was present seemed to glow with exponential value. One of the best long takes of it's time. All the other dances and comical conversations within the film just added to this great film.",9,0,2,7 November 2012
