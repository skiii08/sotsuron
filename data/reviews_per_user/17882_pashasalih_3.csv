Vertigo," this review for thoes who disliked macbeth
","Vertigo just like macbeth are highe praised works made by brillant minds with a lot of thought and passion put into there respected works and the craft behind it.
yet in my opion boht have the same problem , the protagonist is an unsless crybaby. i just can not bare watching them inching forward even tho the side chracters burst with much more intresting themes and branches to explore.
Yet they are still well made and an great deal of fun to analysis all the brilliance in them, just the first time finishing the story can be such an slow, exhausting and demotivating drag...",5,1,6,21 January 2019

Mission: Impossible," Tom Cruise dosn't seem to age but this movie sure does !
","As i write this review this Misson Impossible is 22 years old , wich ofc one needs to consider and not hold against a movie as we juged it. wich normaly is fine, prove of that are Forrest gump, Dead Poet society, Beverly Hills Cop, Prinzess Mononoke and pleanty ohter 'old movies'. These movies can prevel the test of time despite aging effects, simple shots or ( now viewd as ) clich√® plots, because these movies prove to have something timeless. Like iconic dialogs, moving scencs, witty chracters or beautifu imagery. Timeless feature are create when the makers of the movie pure love and time and sweat and blood in it. This movie dosn't seem to have gotten much love at all. Not the storyline nor the acting nor the ridiclous use of james bond like tech nor anything els really. The suposet climax moments in this movie praised by people might have been fitting at the time, but now only nostagic keeps them alive. As someone watching it for the first time, it truely is even for people that fancy the craft of movie making exhaustingly hard to stay awake.",4,3,4,3 August 2018
