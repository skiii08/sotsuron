The Avengers," Your Average Superhero Action Movie. Nothing Special At All.
","The Avengers is your average Superhero Action Movie. The movie only succeeds at doing one thing............mindless action. The Storyline was typical, just a bunch of Superhero's 'saving the world'. The special effects were typical of 2012. After about 20 minutes of watching it you'll get bored. If you love mindless action with your favourite Superhero then you should watch this movie. However if your want a movie which is interesting with an unique storyline, then absolutely do not watch this movie. An overall boring, average Superhero movie. Don't people ever get bored of this typical mess? I know I do.",3,5,12,4 June 2014
12 Angry Men," A Slow Moving But Creative Comical Movie!
","12 Angry Men was an excellent movie. Why? Because it was slow moving but creative. It had many aspects such as different Points of View of the characters. It was a simple however effective storyline. This is not your typical comedy movie! The acting was superb by many of the characters if not all of them. I highly recommend watching this movie if you want tenseness, surprises, thrills and comedy! The basic plot is a boy who is said to have killed his father. All 11 jurors agree, except one. Can the 12th juror convince all of the other jurors to believe him or will he lose out? Eventually, they turn out all to be 12 Angry Men.....",10,1,2,4 June 2014
