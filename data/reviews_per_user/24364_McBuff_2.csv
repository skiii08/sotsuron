Alien 3," Better than rumoured.
","*** SOME SPOILERS *** Don´t let the comments index scare you, this third film in the Alien series is vastly underrated. Sure, it´s got its flaws, but so did Ridley Scott´s original. Some films end on a real downer, this one also STARTS with one, with survivors from Aliens (Newt, Hicks and droid Bishop) killed off before the opening titles. Ripley survives, but lands on a grim prison planet, populated by convicted murderers and rapists, and a couple of seedy and semi-stupid guards and doctors. Sigourney Weaver, head shaved, fatigued but strongwilled, is excellent as Ripley, showing us new sides to her complex character. A supporting cast of mostly British actors (Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and Paul McGann) range from hammy to good, and Charles Dutton is excellent as a reluctantly helpful convict. Lance Henriksen also makes a brief, but welcome return as Bishop and his creator.The force of the film is the mood and cinematography, supported by Elliott Goldenthal´s powerful score. David Fincher creates great atmosphere, some scares and a memorable ending, even though his original synopsis contained ideas for an actionpacked, BIG ending that could have made this rank proudly along its predecessors. Sadly, his budget got cut repeatedly, the original ending was dropped, thus resulting in the most debated threequel of all time. *** (of ****)",7,0,2,4 July 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Three´s enough...
","You gotta give the studio and producers credit for their choice of director. A French art cinema visualist who doesn´t speak any English, instead of a no-nonsense action craftsman (like James Cameron). Perhaps they wanted the series to go in another direction, following the much debated, but criminally underrated #3. The end result is, while not an entire washout, also the most disappointing and uneven of the series. The cast is interesting enough, Jeunet reunites Pinon and Perlman from his previous film 'La citté des enfants perdus'. Weaver rises way above the material, and Ryder is OK. Michael Wincott is strangely subdued and Dan Hedaya´s hairy back is scarier than any alien you´ll ever see! There are a couple of genuinely startling and beautiful scenes that proves Jeunet to be an excellent visual talent. The shootout with Perlman dangling from a ladder is astonishing, and the crew being chased by two aliens underwater is intense and scary, especially with John Frizzell´s forceful score. Watch as a woman desperately tries to escape one of them... The film´s most memorable and poignant scene, however, is where the cloned Weaver meets her previously failed clones. A genuinely touching and sad scene, which is rather abruptly punctured by Perlman´s chauvinist joke.But they blew it with that ending...the alien is about as scary as any of the Teletubbies. **½ (of ****)",5,0,0,4 July 2001
