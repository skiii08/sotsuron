First Man," A lot more than just a standard biopic
","This is my interepretation of a film I wasn't ready to love. Boy, was I wrong.Based on the book 'First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong' by James R. Hansen, director Damien Chazelle and writer Josh Singer took the chronicle of an American triumph and emphasised on the personal story behind it. Through Armstrong's stance, the film makes a clear point: Determination, struggle, sacrifice and most of all failure are key ingredients to someone's eventual success. But in order to achieve success you've got to risk everything, albeit success is never guaranteed.In one scene, Janet Armstrong (excellently played by Claire Foy) claims that she only wanted to lead an ordinary life with her husband. On the contrary, Neil has made a clear choice: He will try to accomplish his great mission, knowing that it is quite possible his kids will never see their father again.Whenever signs of arrogance, conceit and complacency are shown, they are an omen of failure. On the other hand, Armstrong's attitude is the epitome of how success is to be achieved. He is quite commited to his mission and never behaves immaturely when it comes to it. He is focused on his goal. Family and social life, well that's another story (we often see that Armstrong is incapable of communicating or expressing his feelings to his dearest ones).Portraying such an introvert character, Gosling has a sole major moment to shine, in a very important scene which proves to be pivotal in terms of what the movie tries to communicate: USA went to the moon to win the Cold War, while Armstrong, after being marked by tragedy, went to the moon in order to find peace (and by the time his daughter's old memento reappears, we assume he has found some). The film is about him; it doesn't care that much about the US agenda. In fact, I thought that it only showed subtle contempt towards the nationalistic celebrations and the passionate political speeches aimed at boosting the spirit of the American people.Moreover, First Man is one of those biopics where you know what is about to happen, but can't help but get caught up in the rising suspense of its great scenes. At their most exciting, these scenes reach a very satisfying climax, rewarding the audience's patience. Directing and cinematography deserve every accolade they have gotten so far.",8,453,611,6 October 2018
The Death of Stalin," Dark, timely satire
","The Death of Stalin is one of the best political satires I've seen in years.Iannucci, at the top of his game, creates parallels between Stalin's totalitarian regime and present Russia (cult of personality, Putinism), as well as the actions of Trump administration. The appearance of -previously persecuted- Orthodox bishops at Stalin's funeral offers a brief glimpse into the country's future. The slowly changing attitude towards them, let alone the Central Committee members' eagerness to promote liberal reforms, proves that ideologies are just a disguice for political opportunism. That said, the central characters of the story are the epitome of pragmatic cynicism.Steve Buscemi is great. Jason Isaacs is a scene stealer. Simon Russell Beale is the MVP: His portrayal of the NKVD head, Lavrentiy Beria, who is a dangerous sociopath (his awful actions are extremely hard to digest) with an everlasting desire for political power, is nothing sort of spectacular.The pacing is top notch. Comic timing does wonders; no doubt Iannucci has an unique sardonic sense of humor. The movie is absolutely hilarious and shocking at the same time. In a nutshell, 'The Death of Stalin' is as good as a dark political satire can go.",8,0,1,9 March 2018
Green Room," Monumentally idiotic
","After accidentally witnessing a murder at a neo-Nazi skinhead bar, the members of a leftist punk band are forced to wait in a small room with an armed big nazi guy guarding them.The bulky nazi bouncer has 5 bullets inside his gun, hence he can wipe out all four of them (even if he misses one he can surely tear him apart with his bare hands afterwards). Instead, he is ordered by his boss to surrender the gun, which serves to indicate that the Nazis have clearly no intention on killing them... 100%.But this movie lacks common sense:<ul><li>The band members decide not to leave the room, because they still feel endangered! (It doesn't make sense, considering that the Nazis didn't decide to kill them when they clearly had the chance) On the contrary, they choose to barricade themselves into it, giving the Nazis time to empty the club (possible witnesses) and get ready to encounter them.</li></ul><ul><li>It turns out that the nazi boss indeed wanted the band members killed. Wait, what? He could've ordered the bouncer to do so, when the latter had the upper hand.</li></ul><ul><li>After the nazi employee inside the room died, the nazi boss could've killed the rest with some kind of poisonous gas. There were holes on the wall (one of the girls was starring at the Nazis through one), from where the Nazis could have sprayed or shoot the insiders. But, LOL, they don't even opt for guns! What a terrible joke this movie is...</li></ul>",2,8,21,27 August 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Far from a great movie
","I can understand how one can adore this film. Of course it had some very interesting ideas and tried to make certain points, but in the end it was a tonally indecisive mess. Here are some of my main reservations: - The script is overexplanatory and relies too much on coincidence, while it plays down the consequences the main characters would have in real life, when acting nuts. I dare you to go burn a police station down, remain at the scene (regardless of the fact that you are virtually the only suspect) and tell me what happens afterwards. Yes, I know McDonagh would have argued that we shouldn't take the movie at face value, but there are too many -and too important- plot holes to forgive (and this is not a buddy cop comedy for god's sake). - In a cringeworthy flashback scene, we see the mother and daughter quarrel about Angela going out, only for them to prove their precognitive skills (Angela said she hoped she would get raped on the way, and Mildred agreed with her). Well, I'm positive there were more subtle ways to show why Mildred is filled with remorse. - I thought Rockwell's character to be too cartoonish at times. McDonagh said that they had to cut a lot of material because there were tons of moments with Rockwell's character that were too comedic, but there are still many way over the top moments left in the movie. - Willoughby is portrayed as a genuinely decent guy. Honestly, I don't get how can a Sheriff let his racist officers deal with black people the way they did and still qualify as a good person. Supposing he was an ignorant, illiterate redneck, I would be much more willing to excuse this kind of behaviour.",4,265,451,12 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Johnson's fresh touch and Hamill's magnificent performance make for a film which is thrilling, clever, funny and heartbreaking at its best moments
","I attended an advanced press screening of the movie a few hours ago. It won me over! And bear in mind that I hated 'The Force Awakens' (honestly thought it was a Episode IV rip-off). Here, director Rian Johnson doesn't play it safe, and it pays off. If I must point out a certain highlight, it's without a doubt Mark Hamill's performance. I really admired his ability to convincingly convey so many different emotions throughout the film; hats off to this guy. I'll be rooting for him in the future.After I had seen 'The Force Awakens', I figured out I would never like a new Star Wars movie again. Boy, was I wrong. I loved 'The Last Jedi'! This film had clever humour (there was a certain hilarious moment between General Hux and Kylo Ren that I couldn't stop laughing at; you'll totally know when you see the film yourselves), good cinematography and great characters (just see how developed Benicio Del Toro's minor character is) that I could care about. It also had a very good plot for the most part, with many unpredictable and surprising elements. The action was good, and the fighting scenes even better (great choreography).Although the ideas weren't always original, the experience felt real. Therefore, I often struggled to control my emotions. It was the ideal farewell to Carrie Fisher.I mean, what more could I ask for?",8,113,284,11 December 2017
The Nice Guys," The guys are nice. Movie, not so much.
","These are the main reasons why The Nice Guys didn't do it for me: <ul><li>This film wants us to take its ridiculously overstuffed story seriously, while the latter is mainly used as a pretext for jokes and 'funny' situations.</li></ul><ul><li>Let's remember some key plot development parts. When the duo is searching for names or places, they just happen to stumble on them (mostly while driving). Towards the end of the film, a car accident forces their briefcase to open and unveils the fake money. All these are plain luck, but sure as hell aren't genius plot development. (Lest we forget, the dream sequence that leads to the accident, with objects talking to Ryan, is a gigantic clichÃ©) </li></ul><ul><li>Small segments of random scenes may seem relatively funny when secluded from the context of the movie. Take these segments and multiply them by 4 and you have a full scene which is not funny anymore. They just didn't know when to stop. Gosling is another victim of this practice. He obviously has comedic talent, but is constantly overdoing it.</li></ul><ul><li>Didn't like the pacing either. While I was waiting for the story to make some sense, the film unexpectedly slowed down a couple of times. During these parts, even the acting became subdued, causing coherence problems. 'Not quite my tempo' </li></ul><ul><li>A little kid behaves like a clever adult. How original! </li></ul><ul><li>Talking about buddy comedies, even Rush Hour had a huge asset, and I'm talking about the great chemistry between the protagonists. Gosling- Crowe? Not so much. Well, to be honest... not at all! </li></ul><ul><li>The two main characters can be dumb. But they can be clever too. Depends on the scene. Wait... What?</li></ul><ul><li>'How long has he been missing?' 'Since the funeral.' Hands down hilarious. NOT!</li></ul>",3,10,22,27 May 2016
The Martian," Realistic NASA propaganda
","Talking about a realistic film...When a mission in Mars goes wrong, the astronaut crew hurriedly departs from the planet. A crew member (Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon) has an accident and is left behind. He is presumed dead by everyone. NASA issues a statement about it, while the crew is on its way back. Everything's OK up to this point.When it is revealed to NASA that Mark Watney is alive, the organization has two options: 1) Let the world know they mistakenly left an astronaut alone in Mars (gain bad publicity) and be forced to launch a multimillion rescue mission with high probability of failure (NASA's budget and reputation at stake). And all these, just for one man.2) Silence the employee's who know about it (by any means possible) and let Mark Watney die. Nobody will ever know, hence NASA doesn't get bad publicity and saves hundred millions of dollars (to say the least).Guess what... They went for #1! And the Chinese helped them too! Now, this is what I call PROPAGANDA.In addition, the film suffers from an extremely bad sense of humour. I honestly found the 'disco' cue pathetic, but I guess it's a matter of personal taste.Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed this movie. It has great cinematography (not Interstellar standards but still commendable) and overall it is good fun, but obviously it can't be taken seriously.",4,9,19,9 October 2015
