Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything I thought it would be
","I would have to say the movie is absolutley everything I expected, but that isn't exactly a good thing. The special effects were incredible, just as I expected, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen, but I expected the story to be faulty and evidently made up (also known as corny) which is exactly what it was. You can make up stories around anything, even Star Wars. George Lucas said he would make the movie when computers caught up with his ideas, which they obviously did, but he also needed to concentrate on writing a screenplay that was gripping,realistic,emotionally involving, and above all halfway believable. I also thought the film focused way to much on what will happen in the next installments to come, instead of what is happening. Lucas should have written it as if it could survive by itself, it looks more like Episodes 1,2, and 3 will all be one big movie separated into 3 parts. What I'm really saying is if you enjoy such films as The Matrix and The Mummy you will love this movie, if you don't, see it, but lower your expectations.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
