Requiem for a Dream," Perfect Anti-drug Campaign (spoilers within)
","A text or verbal description cannot do this movie justice. It is shocking and eye opening but demands to be seen by both addicts and non-addicts alike. This movie is one of the most powerful films I have ever viewed. I have never personally been at the hand of addiction, or understood why people allow themselves to get caught up in such a world of destruction, but watching this movie makes me actually sympathize not only for the characters in the film, but also users and addicts alike all over the world whom live such horrid, empty lives. What addicts are willing to sacrifice for one more fix is unthinkable. Harry sacrifices his mother's respect and prized possession (TV) multiple times, his health, and also loses the dream of a promising life with his girlfriend. Marion loses her dignity, self-respect, and aspirations of an honest career. Tyrone allows his life to be controlled by crime, which can only last so long, especially as a young, poor black man in a world that still houses ignorant bigotry and racism. Sara sacrifices her health and mental sanity because of a desperate desire to be thin and popular, abusing some form of prescription amphetamine to an extreme degree. `Requiem' provides an explicitly graphic view of the crudeness of the lives of addicts, sparing no details, offering no fairytale happy ending. I truly believe that this movie alone could be one of the greatest works with the potential as an anti-drug campaign. Forget terrorism and `brain on drug' commercials; the US should show `Requiem For A Dream' to every 17-year-old American citizen.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," You have no choice but to see it...
","So what are you waiting for? Why waste your time reading this? You know you're dying to see it. Go see it, then come back and discuss it. Don't spoil it by reading all about it and watching every trailer. What made The Matrix so revolutionary is that you didn't know what to expect and what it offered was a shock. The movie is great; it's fun to watch with action scenes, fight scenes (almost too much), driving scenes (my favorite), love scenes, and more philosophical theories that will blow your mind if you let them. If only Persephone had wanted to kiss Trinity... perfection.",9,0,0,14 May 2003
