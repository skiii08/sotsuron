The Blair Witch Project," Genius!
","I seem to be in the minority when it comes to my fondness for 'The Blair Witch Project'. However, it is the pure genius of it that I admire. The film makers, on a beer budget, produced and marketed a gold mine. Very few films prior had utilized the first-person-shooter aspect and I can think of no other film that successfully delivers the scare factor without any gore or ever showing any villains.I guess what it comes down to is which Horror camp you're in. Blood and gore camp, this is not your film. Scary monsters, nope, skip it. Psychological thrillers, then like me, you might wanna' check this one out.",9,1,2,26 February 2008
Sucker Punch," Sin City Meets The Matrix
","Sucker Punch plays out like a video game/music video, and although some of its tactics are questionable, it proves to be somewhat of a unique and wow-inspiring experience. Young girl (20? yeah right! Try more like 17) is committed to an insane asylum by her evil, pedophile stepfather after a rape attempt goes awry and she accidentally kills her little sister. The stepfather bribes one of the orderlies to put a rush order in for her unwarranted lobotomy, but during the week-long wait for the procedure, imagination propels her into an alternate reality consumed by action-fantasy. Accompanied by a handful of hotties, she does battle with colossal demonic samurai, ferocious orc-like Nazi stormtroopers, metropolis-destined WMD's, and even a fire-breathing dragon, all the while dressed in cleavage-boasting tops and schoolgirl miniskirts. It is a teenage boys dream come true.Not over-overwhelmingly original, the trip is fun, the effects are cool and stylish, and I really dug the backdrop tunes. But I like video game flicks and admittedly, I found myself contemplating which of my library I was going to slip into the PS3 once I got home. To that end, the film was a bit of an inspiration.I disagreed with the PG-13 rating. Responsible parents beware. The movie is packed with strong sexual under and overtones. Now before all you anti-censorship zealots get your panties crammed into wedgies, I agree that to take away from its extremely sexy seductiveness would leave it naked and rather impotent and I am merely suggesting it should have received the R-rating it deserved. Never mind that the matinée I hit held 50+ year old men as the majority in attendance (hmmm)... This is an exploitation flick flaunting young, scantily-clad, cuties wielding swords and kicking ass while trying to escape a whorehouse. I just don't think the little kiddies should be Sucker Puch-ed. My only real exception, as is true with any film dealing with similar subject matter, is the making light of pedophilia. This movie opens disturbingly with a dirty old man about to rape a young, preteen girl. Something of that nature has no business even being insinuated or associated with ensuing images clearly intended to titillate and peak the libido.",6,1,8,25 March 2011
The Ring," Scared the HELL outa' me!
","There are thrillers that vacate your thoughts as soon as the credits roll and then there are thrillers that sink deep into your subconscious and remain with you for days, weeks, months... dare I say years after the credits roll. 'The Ring' takes its rightful throne in the latter category.When her niece dies a gruesome death, journalist Rachael Kellers (Naomi Watts) investigation leads her to a mysterious videotape. As soon as she views the tape the phone rings and a malevolent child's voice warns 'seven days'. When she rings her old boyfriend into watching the tape and their young son decides to have a peek too, thus begins their desperate search for the truth.'The Ring' scared me. It scared me for weeks. I unashamedly admit that I slept with the light on and moved the TV out of my bedroom. I have one word for you. Samara.",9,1,1,20 October 2008
Hostel," Intriguing premise, extremely poor execution
","Admittedly, I was deceptively seduced by this film's trailer and movie poster into believing that this film would cross the threshold into uncharted territory of the horror genre. OK, OK, I know. That's the desired effect the movie makers hope to accomplish with those two vehicles. However, the disturbingly haunting advertisements were so reminiscent of dark films such as The Shining, The Exorcist, and even The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (all three breaking new ground in cinematic horror), that I took the bait. Unfortunately, as is all too often the case, I was disappointed. When will I learn my lesson? What worked for me: I found the premise that wealthy perverts pay Slovakian mobsters big bucks to torture and murder kidnapped tourists to be quite chillingly possible, just as films like Hardcore and 8mm exposed the feasibility of 'snuff' films. I must also confess that I found the blatantly gratuitous lovemaking scene extremely hypnotic. Two beautiful and quite nude Slovakian ladies writhing to The Sneaker Pimp's 'How Do' playing in the background was intoxicating. Please forgive the male hetero dog in me.What didn't work for me: the director, Eli Roth, failed in his obvious attempt to assault me with an 'over-the-top' sado-sexual exploitation film. Sure, there were a couple times when I winced and said 'Yuck!' (such as when a victim's eyeball is torn from its socket and left dangling whilst she screams), but at no time did this film remotely deliver the fear it promised. Even the violence was an overall shock-less 'blah.' Character development was so non-existent that I felt not a smidgen of sympathy for the protagonists. Roth would have had better luck if this film had been geared towards a public health message warning 'keep it in your pants and don't sleep around or you might have your fingers cut off and your eyeballs ripped out of your head', as the two protagonists come off as a couple horny imbeciles looking to score on anything female, awake or passed out. The ending was not only inconceivably unrealistic, but I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at such a botched attempt at irony. The only irony I enjoyed was reading the film's tag line: 'Welcome to your worst nightmare' as I left the theater. There was no art here, only the greedy intent to capitalize on violence looking for their next fix. I enjoyed Cabin Fever more than this film, and I hated Cabin Fever.I'll leave you with this: if 'I Spit On Your Grave' floated your boat, then you'll probably see this film as a masterpiece, and if you do, I have two words for you: Get Help!",7,1,2,5 December 2006
Closer," Yada Yada Yada
","When I watch a film, I hope to get one of the following out of the experience: a) be entertained, b) learn something, or c) benefit somehow spiritually. If the film provides me with two or even all three of these, all the better.'Closer' did not provide me with any substance from any of these aforementioned areas. As far as being entertained, aside from enjoying the sight of Natalie Portman seductively writhing in lingerie, this film scored 'B' for boredom. Perhaps the only thing that kept me going was the hope of more scenes of Portman scantily clad. I learned nothing I did not already know from the film. When someone cheats on their significant other, it causes irreparable pain, and is very selfish and cruel. Duh! The only spiritual benefit I received from the film was the reassurance that I wasn't as shallow. weak-willed, and depressed as the characters on the screen. OK, so maybe there was a lil' positive influence.But seriously folks... there just was nothing intriguing or even remotely interesting about this film. Portman, Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, and Jude Law all gave fantastic performances. Unfortunately, it was talent completely wasted on a nowhere story.",5,2,4,24 August 2007
Saw III," Enough was enough!
","The first SAW was intriguing. Although it was so obviously derived from Seven, I still thought it was clever. One of its traits I admired was that it made me flinch from the gore without actually displaying any gore. In my humble opinion, that is an example of the art of movie making. I admit, the ending caught me off-guard, and in a fun I-can't-believe-I-didn't-see-that-coming sort of way.Saw 2? Not worth the breath required to cast a comment.I heard great things about Saw 3. Of course, I had heard great things about King Kong (2005) too. I was disappointed. In fact, I had to literally force myself to watch the film. I saw the ending coming within the first 15 minutes. I felt absolutely no pity for any of the characters, save the poor chap who was forced to swim in pig guts. The gore was disgusting in an obnoxious and irritating kind of way. Saw 3 is a prime example of a film franchise that needs to be put down to sleep... permanently.",4,1,3,10 January 2007
Across the Universe," Very Good but Had the Potential for Excellence
","I grew up watching musicals. 'Oklahoma', 'Singing in the Rain', 'West Side Story'... These were great films with great stories and great musical performances. They tended to be on the longer side, but no one noticed while watching, because everyone was transfixed on the film. The fact that so many folks have praised 'Across the Universe' in their reviews indicates that musicals, with quality production, could make a magnificent comeback.The music and the visuals were wonderful. I especially enjoyed T.V. Carpio's rendition of 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' and Joe Cocker and company with 'Come Together'. The choreography as a whole was excellent! More than once, I found myself singing along.For me, the music sequences were able to sustain an otherwise ridiculous storyline that reminded me of 1978's 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band' or 1980's 'Xanadu'. In the case of 'Across the Universe', the plot is haphazardly shaped around the lyrics of many Beatles' songs. There is (Sexy) Sadie and (Dear) Prudence, JoJo (Get Back) and (Hey) Jude, and even Lucy (In the Sky With Diamonds). It's all fun, sure, but the script lacks any serious creativity. The story's backdrop seemed to me an attempt at Forrest Gump meets 'John, Paul, George, and Ringo'. For me, it just didn't work as planned. About 30-45 minutes out from the end you start looking at your watch, but the finale leaves a very pleasant taste that lingers well after the credits have finished rolling.I would love to experience this film in an Imax as so much of it is an amazing combination of sight and sound. It could have been a masterpiece, but is still very good.",8,0,2,16 February 2008
The Mist," Compelling, but nothing new...
","A storm wreaks havoc on a small north-eastern community. The following morning, after he inspects the damage, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son (Nathan Gamble) go into town to purchase some essentials only to find themselves held captive by a menacing mist teaming with all sorts of slithering nasties, flying uglies, and creepy crawlies.There is nothing unique about 'The Mist'. The film is 'Jumanji' meets 'The Fog'. Let's see... we've got our military experiments gone awry along with Stephen King-typical religious fanatics and small town hicks. Thomas Jane as the main protagonist does a decent job here. However, I was disappointed with the fragmented and haphazard way Andre Braugher's character, the paranoid litigant, was yo-yoed in and out of the film. I was equally disappointed by the idiocy of William Sadler's character, the local yokel simpleton bully, and especially Marcia Gay Harden, who played the part of the religious zealot. I found her as distastefully obnoxious in this film as I did in 'Mystic River'. Yes, I know she is meant to be obnoxious, but she runs with it all just a bit too far, in my humble opinion.The only true horror of the film is its ending. I won't rob you of that experience, but be prepared to be unprepared. It is trademark King. Many folks have voiced strong dissatisfaction with the ending, claiming it as nonsensical, too disturbing, leaving them in a sickened and perplexed mood. I suggest that the ending of this film is horror in its purest sense, and horror doesn't have a name, doesn't feel warm and fuzzy, and definitely is void of logic. The ending is also quite congruent in the way King habitually concludes his short stories and novellas. Unfortunately, as is almost always the case with films adapted from King's novels (The Mist was a novella) 'The Mist' was an overall flaccid exercise.",5,1,5,1 December 2007
Mulholland Drive," Strange Just To Be Strange Is Ho-Hum
","Let's be honest. David Lynch films are cult films and cult films are popular because their cult films. It doesn't mean that they're very good film making. 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'... I rest my case.Initially, Lynch's method for generating ideas seemed to be: a) Drop acid. b) Remember your trip. c) Make a movie out of it.Now the method seems to have changed to: a) Drop acid. b) Watch one of your own films. c) Pretend that what you saw is something new. d) Make a new movie out of it.Granted, I am intrigued by Lynch's films, but then I have never dropped acid. Is there some connection there? Perhaps, but once you see one Lynch film then you have basically seen them all. They're all bizarre, but I suspect only for the mere sake of being bizarre. Further, Lynch has done the same 'bizarre' over and over to the point that it isn't even bizarre anymore. He's become his own clichÃ©.For me, 'Mulholland Dr.', of all the Lynch films, was one of his better efforts. It did not have the snail pace of some of his others, such as 'Lost Highway'. Naomi Watts was excellent in her portrayal of a Hollywood hopeful who cares for a strange woman suffering from amnesia. The story floats around their relationship and their investigatory efforts to discover the woman's identity.Just as in other Lynch films, people trade bodies, lives are threatened, devilish figures speak in riddles slowly, and women get naked. To the latter, the couple of scenes with Watts and Laura Harring getting down and Sapphoian might delight the nude-celeb groupies out there, but beyond that, they are shamefully... embarrassingly gratuitous. C'mon!",5,3,7,7 September 2007
Paranormal Activity," The Paranormal Activity is in the ratings...
","Ten years ago, two guys, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, put together a scary little film on a peanut-shell budget and utilized the still-fledgling Internet to create a seemingly 'paranormal' phenomenon which became known as The Blair Witch Project. The film was shot from a first person perspective of an amateur film crew out to investigate 'paranormal activity' stemming from a spooky little backwoods legend. The effects were simple, yet spine-chillingly effective and many folks began re-thinking the whole camping idea. It was an amazingly original idea and to this day, I still consider the film and its marketing campaign a work of genius. It was something new and without a doubt, prompted the whole 'reality' scene we are all too familiar with today.Now, fast forward to present day and we have been shelled with a film which attempts to capitalize on all the elements that made Blair effective. This time, however, the gimmicks are a mere hodgepodge of unoriginality from its shallow introduction of the protagonists to the dragging around on the floor REC (Quarantine) style, to the open-ended questions that are meant to linger in our minds when the final credits role. To boot, there is this very suspicious marketing campaign that borders on the edge of unethical where screenings and online reviews more than likely have been staged by greedy film execs to hype up that which just isn't worthy of the hype. Let's seeÂ… we have shadows, doors opening and closing, chandeliers swinging, sinister voices, and a whole lota' screams from the female lead. We even have a Ouija board. I am not kidding. They are pulling all the stops on all the haunted house gags this time. I found myself wondering when Abbott and Costello were going to run through the room chased by a dangling skeleton. The most fun you might have watching this little venture is if you bring along a pad and pen and jot down which film each of the overplayed 'scares' are stolen from. Then, however, you still are forced to endure the most boring of sequences to make it to the next evening all the while dismissing all logic to believe a couple would even remain in this haunted house.Frankly, I am very disappointed. I had hoped for a fun and scary ride with Paranormal Activity but it turned out to be nothing more than pretentious in an annoying sort of way. What is most 'disturbing' is this clatter and clang of borderline heresy I keep hearing that suggests Paranormal Activity gauges up there with films such as The Exorcist. If you can look me in the eye and keep a straight face while trying to convince me that such fear can be derived here, I will most certainly wince with a disgusted perplexity and reply, 'Surely you jest...'",2,28,56,22 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Shave off 30 minutes and the film would be a 10!
","'The Dark Knight' is one of those rare films worth paying for to see on the big screen. One word: Awesome! I have never been much of a fan of films based on comic books (because they usually stink!) 'The Dark Knight' is an exception, and what an exceptional film it is. Unlike his predecessors, Christian Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman is perfect. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker: Superb! The film's only weakness is that it runs about a half-hour too long and goes a direction that, in my humble opinion, would have been best saved for another sequel.'The Dark Knight' is worth your money and your time. I have been waiting a long while to say that about a film.",9,2,6,22 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Sorry Dad
","My father's favorite film is 2001. I was familiar with 2001 before most kids were probably potty trained. My dad had the album and other than Apocalypse Now, 2001 was the only film my father dared sit through.Well, I was adopted, and that is made plainly evident by the fact the I think 2001: A Space Odyssey is quite possibly the most boring science fiction film I have ever endured.Sure, the special effects and sets were revolutionary in the sci-fi genre. Sure the musical score was brilliant. Sure, the symbolism was profound at times. But the film moved along like a slug on ice! For me, the film began when HAL short circuited and ended with his demise. 'Daisy, daisy...' and 'Dave, Dave...' are classic. Some Kubrick I love and some Kubrick I don't fancy much. This film falls on the latter end of the scale. Sorry Dad.",6,3,6,21 August 2007
Taken," A Breath of Fresh Air
","How wonderful it would be if 'Taken' was a standard, an average type film, that all films today were measured by. Instead, 'Taken' turns out to be a great film in comparison to the majority of the crap released these days. Thank you, Mr. Pierre Morel, for the breath of fresh air!Liam Neeson adeptly portrays an ex-CIA operative who has retired in order to make up for lost time with his teenage daughter. When, while vacationing in Paris, she and her friend are abducted into the international sex trade, Neeson pulls all the stops and calls upon all his resources and skills in order to locate and save her.'Taken' is exciting in a 'Quantum of Solace' James Bond sort of way. Neeson proves, once again, his diversity as an actor. Bravo!",8,5,11,19 January 2009
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Effectively Eye Opening, Gut-Wrenching Garbage
","'Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma' is, undoubtedly, a very effective film. I spent several hours reading reviews of this film before watching it this evening. I am not into films that are sick and grotesque merely to push the envelope of what is considered art. Anyone can defecate on canvas and label it so, but saying it is so doesn't make it so. This film has more interpretations than five times its minutes in length. I suppose different people see different things and, in no small way, what one brings with them and their reasons for wishing to expose themselves to it, play a large role in where the experience will take them. For me, the experience was very reminiscent of Ken Russell's 1971 Film 'The Devils' http://imdb.com/title/tt0066993/ in the way it portrays the evils those in power inflict upon the commoner. For me, there is only one reason which seems fitting to endure this film and that is to understand the depravity that exists in our world and where it ultimately leads if left unchecked by the citizens of a society. If you watch this film intending to see image upon image of nudity, you will be disappointed. If you come to the table to challenge yourself to see how much abuse your eyes and mind can handle, I think most will be equally disappointed. However, there is not one single act of perversion which is not represented here, and although many of the folks who have reviewed this film have remarked how uncomfortable and un-arousing this film is, either due to their naiveté or inability to be honest with themselves, they are not being truthful. Granted, a good number of people will find this film abhorrently objectionable, but one only needs to spend a small bit of time on the internet and in cinemas today to recognize that the perversions and depravity in this film are severely dwarfed by real life. After all, we live in a time where 'torture porn' is an extremely popular genre, the mere description indicating sexual arousal by means of torture and violence. The public is addicted to sexual violence, perversions, and debauchery. It is what sells. That is why, apparently, most have submitted to 'Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma' and the state of disheartening unease they discover themselves in when the final credits roll compels them to seek justification, a rationale, some reasonable excuse as to why they subjected themselves to such a soul-less and nihilistic onslaught of images and sound. Truly, the film empties the viewer of all hope and feelings of well-being. That, or it sexually excites and motivates the sociopath to deviancy by opening doors and nailing them to remain open. It is the latter group which is most disconcerting and, I believe, the number of which is far under-estimated.'Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma' provides a prophetic vision of where we are headed, while reminding us of where we were and where we are currently. I cannot recommend this film and I cannot say that it will better anyone for having seen it. There is absolutely no necessity for or about it. However, it will forever change you and how you view the world. One reviewer wisely commented on how this film changed his perception of the horror genre, and although I don't see this film as horror per se, the reviewer's point was quite profound. Therein lies the art of its effectiveness.",2,4,12,6 April 2008
The Descent," Chilling Claustrophobia
","What is worse than finding yourself trapped in a cave miles below the surface? Finding yourself trapped in a cave miles below the surface and hunted by flesh-eating humanoid creatures.'The Descent' reminded me of the good ol' horror films of the seventies where the horror sinks its teeth into you at the onset and never lets go even after the credits roll.When tragedy claims the husband and daughter of a young woman, she attempts to heal by partaking in a little cave exploration with her daredevil friends. What starts of as an exciting and fun-filled venture quickly darkens into a desperate fight for survival amidst betrayal, panic, and deception. The cave dwellers become stranded in the cave cut off from the outside world when the ceiling of their only route out collapses. As they attempt to discover another path of escape, they slowly become aware that they are not alone.This film serves up the scares in claustrophobic fashion. The acting is excellent. The fiends are frightening. The blood is plentiful.",8,1,3,24 June 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Good but not Great
","There are a few items that perplex me regarding this film. First, a review posted in the IMDb on September 15, 2006 makes reference to 'too much nudity' in the film on the part of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, yet there was no nudity in the film. That, in itself, baffles me... but I digress. The second is why the scene where the Deputy is crucified like a butterfly. Realistically, where would Lecter have had the time, and being that the deputy was a large man, where did Hopkins summon the strength? OK, with those two issues aside, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a good film. I think it was deserved of Best Picture for that year, 1991, as well considering its competition. I don't think it was a great movie, however.I don't usually compare films with their novel counterparts, because films and books are really two separate beasts. Sometimes, such as with 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, I make exceptions, but that is more the exception than the norm. Because I have seen many reference made to 'The Silence of the Lambs' the movie versus 'The Silence of the Lambs' the book, I feel compelled to comment. I read the book and I found the book to be very shallow. The film was far better. And that is all I have to say about that.'Silence' worked primarily because of Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) and Ted Levine (Jame Gumb.) Jodie Foster did an above average job as Clarice Starling, but there is just something about Foster that rubs me the wrong way in the film. I can't quite place my finger on it, maybe her attempt at a southern accent or maybe her masculine mannerisms and boyish looks, but she 'just didn't do it for me.' As I have stated in my review of the film 'Hannibal', I found Julianne Moore to be far better suited for the part of Clarice Starling. Perhaps it is mere preference, and that is all.As I initially mentioned, there were some mechanical problems with the film. Overall, the film worked, though. It is a very dark and disturbing tale, and the atmosphere stays quite faithful to that premise with it's dark color tones and macabre soundtrack. There are few characters that earn the eerie and sinister reputation of Hannibal (the Cannibal) Lecter, and as already stated, this is a credit to Hopkins. The film's conclusion is both suspenseful and darkly comical. Some find themselves frustrated by the open-ended ending, but I found it perfect, especially how it made for an easy transition into the sequel.",7,0,3,7 March 2007
