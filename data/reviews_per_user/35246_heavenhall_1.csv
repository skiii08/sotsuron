The Sound of Music," my fair lady v.s. the sound of music
","Though both of them are my favourite movies, i don't think there will be some connections between them, besides Julie Andrews was supposed to be Eliza but wasn't and Audrey Hepburn might become Maria but actually not. However when I find that footman at the embassy ball to call each one of the guest's name such as 'Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering. Professor Higgins' is 'Herr Zeller',I am shocked. And the Hungarian 'Karpathy' is Theodore Bikel, who acts Captain von Trapp at the stage in 1959 or so. This make me feel........ Well, His figure is quite different from Christopher Plummer and when i hear his actually singing Edelweiss in CD i am nearly dizzy. Of course Mr Plummer's was dubbed and I am quite used to Bill Lee's. I don't know whether Mr Plummer's real voice is better than Bill Lee, but actually I don't like Theodore Bikel's singing, and, his flat figure.",10,1,8,27 March 2004
