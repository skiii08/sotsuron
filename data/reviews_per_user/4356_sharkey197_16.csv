Angels & Demons," If you want the book. . . go read it
","It was only after seeing the film that I realized exactly how much had been changed or left out of the film and the odd thing is, I didn't miss it at all. While the book is richer and has much more character detail, that's the way books are. As a film, a fast-paced entertaining colorful story, this does very well. Let's face it, some of what Dan Brown writes is really implausible. I mean, did anyone really believe that Langdon could jump out of a helicopter with only a small sheet as a parachute and actually survive? And I was rather glad that the silly, rather precious sub plot of the Camerlengo being the biological son of the late pope, conceived without a sex act was gone. That was kind of embarrassing in its unbelievability. Tom Hanks is rapidly growing into the role Gregory Peck once occupied--when we see him, we trust him because he's Tom Hanks. The cast was interesting in its international flavor and the CGI used to round out the places they weren't allowed to really shoot in was excellent. You have to take Dan Brown novels for what they are--wild rides to nowhere, but you love getting to the destination. Just don't think about it too much. As a film, this was pretty decent since the book they were adapting was a difficult plot line that contained many, many deviations from the main. I say, just sit back and enjoy. Don't forget the popcorn. This film was made for it.",7,0,0,24 November 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Consider--it's 90 years old!
","As I read these comments on this most controversial film, what is coming across is a surfeit of emotion that any film rarely engenders. I wonder if any of our modern films will be able to evoke such passionate response 90 years from now and the fact is, I think not. Yes, the film is racist. Yes, the film is a watershed for cinema. And no matter what you think of it, it's still got people stirred up, ready to scream and yell and be appalled, disgusted, outraged, etc. Can there be any doubt as to its greatness if it still has such a life today? Its greatness certainly doesn't lie in its subject matter, but in the fact that this silent film can provoke such reactions in a generation weaned on computer graphic images, a generation that views the silents much as they view watching a parade of fossils drift by. I am literally stunned by the power of a piece of film to move so many so long after it came into the world. Perhaps its greatest lesson is the impact films have on us and our society and how powerful those moving images can really be. Something tells me that 90 more years will go by and this message board--if it's still here--will be still be getting impassioned opinions from those who have just seen Birth of a Nation. My word--what immortality!",7,112,188,3 October 2005
Sleepy Hollow," Not a purist
","Even though I am an English teacher, I did not find myself at all bothered by the fact that Burton took enormous liberties with Irving's short story. The atmosphere of Gothic mystery that he created was astounding and he familiarized a new generations with a classic American writer. But what I loved about this film was the production values; I saw it on the big screen and thought that every single frame could have been made into a wonderful, individual picture. Now with the pause on DVD my theory has been proved correct. This is one of the most beautifully photographed, almost heart-breakingly gorgeous productions I've ever seen. Did anyone noticed the paint peeling on the window sashes when Icabod first arrives? Such attention to detail! I just wish the film wasn't rated R. This would be so perfect to show to my critical viewing class as an example of first rate production design, but we are not allowed to show any R's. I really don't think it should be rated R; it's not really that gory and the one sex scene is tame indeed.",8,1,2,9 August 2005
Crash," A strange film
","This film came highly recommended by people I respected. I watched it with eager anticipation. I was in the minority, however. I felt the film was obvious, contained every clich√© in the book and suffered from such predictable plots that I couldn't believe it was being raved about by the people who had raved. I did think it was trying to do something different and important, and after seeing what movies have come to these days, I felt it deserved credit for that. But I could not get on the Crash bandwagon with no reservations. I felt it was a flawed film.I was watching--had almost gone to bed--when they announced it As Best Picture, beating out the favorite, Brokeback Mountain. It was worth staying up to see the reactions which were heartwarming for the people who won. Having also seen Brokeback, which I thought was terrible overrated, I would have also voted for CRash as Best Picture. At least Crash was making an effort to treat a topic that is timely and important. I felt Brokeback didn't do nearly such a good job.So anyway, there are lots of Best Pictures that weren't true masterpieces. At least this one tried and made a great effort. Give it that.",6,2,5,14 July 2006
MASH," Did Hawkeye steal that jeep?
","As a teacher of critical viewing of film, I ended this school year with a unit of films of social commentary and chose this film as the final installment for the course. To the kids, it was a revelation. None of them had ever imagined you could do such an anti war film with so much humor. At first they were having trouble following it because of the overlapping dialogue and because this generation is just not oriented to listening. Viewing it with captions helped and as soon as they got into the plot, they were hooked completely. They especially loved the fake suicide scene and found the singing of the song with such jaunty style while a man was supposedly killing himself, hilarious. But even though I've found modern day kids love to laugh and adore silly, they did get the deeper issues and many of them picked it for their favorite movie. The best comment I had was from a particularly astute sophomore who said that the comedy was just 'there'. It didn't have to be forced down your throat like comedies of today. After a year of teaching this course and finding out to my sadness that the modern teen has no taste, no background and very little sophistication when it comes to film, I feel that exposing them in an educational way to these movie classics not only enhances their appreciation of film, but of the world in general.",10,2,7,28 June 2006
Forrest Gump," An unpopular review
","I hated this movie. When it came out and I actually went around saying that people thought I was odd or maybe alien to this planet. But I thought it was the most manipulative, unrealistic, piece of tripe I ever saw. Nothing that happens to Forrest would happen in reality and don't tell me it's a parable, because I don't even think it works on that level. The truth is if I was sitting on a bench with Forrest and he started to tell me his life story, I would get up and leave because strangers who behave that way make me uncomfortable and many people would admit this if they were honest enough to get over the emotional aspects of the story. Jenny was a tramp who didn't love him and slept around and didn't deserve that slavish devotion. And the line 'Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get' not only makes 'love means never having to say you're sorry' look profound, but it's untrue to boot. Whitman samplers publish the contents on the inside of the box. So, shoot me. I thought this movie appealed to the worst sentimental instincts of the human race and I resented being asked to go along with it.",1,47,111,28 December 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," how far we have sunk culturally
","I found this movie's title offensive, to begin with. Immediately, you know it's going to be about some guy who reaching his 40th birthday without having had sex will be pressured or helped by his friends to go out and get some. As if sex was something to be hunted like prey or the partner needed for such an act was just incidental. The humor USN't--it's offensive and vulgar and the dialogue sounds like a bunch of dirty minded 15 year old boys. The fact that so many people on this website are calling it wonderful is disturbing. I think as a society we have sunk pretty low. Why is this man's private life subject matter for a joke? What is wrong with not having sex if that is your choice? And is nothing private anymore? The scene at the end when he's in bed with his wife and the subsequent 'jokes' is distasteful and so low class. I guess as long as people crave this sort of tripe they will keep making it, but it makes me very sad.",1,28,54,1 August 2006
Enchanted," Brilliant use of CGI
","This is a perfect example of how CGI, a technique that today is often overused just to impress, can actually enhance a story. I really enjoyed the film, but what made it for me was the visual effects. I had to keep reminding myself that Pip was a CGI creation and not a real chipmunk--he looked so real. And it was only after the movie was over that I realized ditto for the dragon at the end. By that time I had completely suspended my disbelief and simply thought, hey, a dragon. It was also nostalgic to see the older Disney animation at the beginning, which at first was a shock, being used to the more sophisticated methods of today. While the story is predictable, that does not detract from the humor or the enjoyment of this piece. And did I mention that the CGI was great?",7,1,2,28 August 2008
Mamma Mia!," Meryl Streep simply cannot be mortal
","How can anyone do Mama Mia! and Doubt in the same year and be so utterly convincing in each??? I am convinced that Streep is really some sort of goddess sent here to show us what acting is all about.This movie is rather cheesy, but I find myself watching it again and again. I guess it's what everyone mostly feels, but it is such a fun romp. Watching Streep play this role is a dazzling journey and the rest of the cast is wonderful, too. The music is bouncy and fun and it's just a good time. Sometimes you need that, instead of something serious and cerebral.And I will confess, the first time through I didn't know that was Julie Walters until the credits rolled and then I shouted, 'Mrs. Weasely??!' I had to run the DVD back to see that last number. She was so into her different persona that she fooled me completely.Meryl Streep . . . perhaps the greatest actress of the 20th century. And she's still going strong in the 21st.",8,1,2,12 August 2009
Gran Torino," Gran Eastwood
","It's hard to believe that Eastwood is almost 80 and still going this strong. I really enjoyed the subtle nuances of this movie and while it was a little predictable--I knew half an hour in that Eastwood would die and leave the car to the kid--I didn't anticipate the way it would end or Walt's final act, which was really great. Much has been made of the racist comments of this character, but I would pose the attitude that it is less important how you talk, than it is how you act. Walt may talk racist, but he's inherently not when it comes to judging people by their essence, as is shown by his championing of the Hmung family that he comes to know. I would also like to take issue with someone on this board who said it was unrealistic for Walt to suddenly stop to fix a rocking washing machine for the family he hardly knew. Actually, this is exactly what my father would have done, a man very similar in style and attitudes to WAlt Kowalski. It was like a compulsion for men of this generation--if they came across something broken, they would fix it. That was what being a man was all about in this generation. It's incredible to think this film was so overlooked at the Oscars. But maybe that's because there was actually very little violence and too much thought provoking action. Bravo to Eastwood for giving us a film about ideas and not just automatic weapons.",8,0,7,7 August 2009
Back to the Future Part III," my favorite trilogy
","I stumbled across these films years ago while renting videos and was completely enchanted with their inventiveness and the way they held together over three films. I know that some people knock 2 or 3, but frankly, I thought 2 was incredibly creative and 3 is my favorite. Yes, if you start examining things too closely, you can find holes, but let's be realistic--you have to suspend disbelief to accept time travel in the first place, so why nit pick? I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of my DVD trilogy and can't wait to see the extras. And my favorite line in all the three--'you better go out there, or people will say that Clint Eastwood is the biggest coward in the west'. And I loved the Eastwood ravine at the end. These films were so well plotted and put together--not just your typical sequels because the first one made money.",9,1,1,20 August 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," How about metaphor?
","I agree that one should not trivialize the Holocaust as some are saying and even some rabbis who dissed the book. But cannot you realize that this film, while maybe fudging some accuracies, has delivered a powerful punch that illustrates the horror behind the whole master race thing?? I wasn't expecting the ending until the very last ten minutes and then I was appalled. I noticed the comment on here from someone who took issue with the fact that Bruno's mother was weeping for her lost child and asked what about the millions of Jewish parents who wept for their children? Hey, that was the whole point! Can't you see the parallel? It was also very unique to see this event through the eyes of a child and to see a typical German family and how they responded to the events. Not all in sympathy. I agree that we must never forget the 'monsters' who perpetrated the Holocaust. But I've always been more intrigued by the 'good' people who went along and wondered about what was going on in their heads at the time. Coming from a German/A,American background, it's a very personal question. How did they cope? I don't think this film could fail to awaken anyone to the misery and horror of the Holocaust. If people want complete accuracy, they can view the films taken of the camps after they were liberated.",8,3,6,16 August 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Richard Harris twirling in his grave
","There was much to like about this movie, but the thing I must state is that I thought the portrayal of Dumbledore was completely against the character and is irresponsible. He would never lose control like that. If you go back to the book, he uses the same lines with Harry, but he is described as asking them calmly. What is up here? Don't these people read the books? Harris's death was very unfortunate, but for the franchise it's proving deadly. Gambone is so off track that I was offended. I wonder what JK thinks? If I were she, I'd be livid. Too much was also omitted from the end where we are set up for the controversy surrounding Voldemort's return and this made the ending fall flat. Where are all the reactions to what Harry has reported? It was a let down ending.",7,2,3,21 November 2005
Casino Royale," Sean and Timothy--you still rock!
","I love James Bond. I have read all of Fleming's novels. The best thing about this Casino Royale was the fact that they released all the old films on DVD in collector's format. And just for the record, it really isn't based on the book, Casino Royale.Sure, there are plot points. The torture scene, the romance with Vesper, the infamous line 'the bitch is dead', which is a wonderful end to the book, so why not end the movie there as well? But Vesper's character has been truncated. In the book she is also an agent and has been passing information for years to save her lover's life. She has far more depth and far more culpability in the book.Baccarat is the game played in the book, not poker, which just doesn't have the same glamor factor. And what if none of us know how to play baccarat? They could have found a way to make it comprehensible. The whole casino scene just lost it for me there. It seemed more like Atlantic City, rather than Monte Carlo.And okay, get rid of the cheesy gadgets, but install a heart defibrillator in the car instead on the off chance that someone might poison him with a heart drug!!?? Oh, yeah, this works for me. Is this any less believable than the oil slicks or ejector seats or--it's been knocked so much on this website--Peirce's invisible car? And by the way, that little incident isn't in the book.And what can I say about Daniel? He has no physical attraction, no charisma and quite frankly, being a tortured soul doesn't mean you have to act like a block of wood. If you want to look for a Bond who is better and true to Fleming's character, go to DAlton. He was great and very much like the Bond of the books.I missed the humor, although I will say, it had a rather good script.I found that guy's eye problem annoying, not very necessary to the plot and it made his villain seem weak. What was the point, anyway? It was better than the worst of the Bond pictures--Moonraker, for example--, but it certainly wasn't the best ever.",5,1,2,27 March 2007
Rear Window," when movies had dialogue, not car chases
","I first saw Rear Window when I was teenager in the '60's, babysitting on a Saturday Night and it's lucky the kids were in bed and asleep, because I was completely enthralled. I'd never seen anything so wonderful and didn't know that movies like that existed. It held me from the first moment and the way it made you look at the people was amazing. Then it went into hibernation for years and years, and I was very happy to see it back. It still is a masterpiece and is a sorry comment on movies today which rely more on technology and violence to hold an audience rather than characters and plot. A really talky film, it's an entire four course meal that truly satisfies. What has always impressed me is the final scene with Thorwald where you actually feel sorry for the guy. It's a rare film maker that can make you do this, after setting him up as the villain for two hours. This film can be studied for the wonderful use of camera alone and still be compelling. And was there ever a woman as hauntingly lovely as Grace Kelly? She already acted like a princess.",10,1,4,2 September 2005
The Great Escape," The best WWII film ever!
","I was a junior in high school when this movie was first shown on television. My dad, a WWII vet, urged me to sit down with him and watch it. But being a girl, and much too cool to watch movies with my father, I declined and spent the evening doing 'important' things of which I have no memory. Several years later, I saw it in college on the big screen and adored it. What a great story! And it made me proud to be an American, thinking of all those brave men who sacrificed so much for something they knew would probably not work, but which might help the war effort just a bit. It is the kind of sacrifice that my generation just didn't 'get' and now that I am older have the utmost respect for. The generation that fought that war is truly the great generation of the 20th century. And one of my biggest regrets ever is that I did not watch it that night with my dad. It would have been a great bonding experience and maybe I would have gotten even more out of it watching it with someone who was actually in that war. I am about to show this film to my critical viewing class and I hope it effects them in the same way. This is a story that needs to be in the minds and hearts of our young people.",10,2,4,23 December 2005
