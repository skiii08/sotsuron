The Avengers," My boyhood dream has been realised.
","I have been waiting for an Avengers movie for well over a decade and when I found out that it was even in the pipeline I was beside myself with excitement. I went to see the movie with somewhat high expectations due to the cast involved and the previous Marvel movies building up to this title. I have to say that it completely surpassed my expectations and I was amazed throughout the entire movie. I attended the screening in 3D and I honestly have no idea why people had anything bad to say about the 3D in this movie as it was quite brilliant. For me, the underrated characters in the movie are Black Widow and Hawkeye. I felt that these characters were portrayed perfectly by Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. I also felt that we have finally found a perfect actor in Mark Ruffalo to play The Hulk. The two actors that have recently played Bruce Banner/The Hulk have been pretty good but both seemed to be lacking in something but I could never put my finger on it. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk.Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. I can see exactly why there has been a massive explosion of potential Marvel movies in the pipeline and I cannot wait to see what the sequel could bring. I feel that Hawkeye and Black Widow could definitely have their own movies if not a movie where they are working together. I also hope that the people at Marvel and Disney have identified Mark Ruffalo's great ability to play Bruce Banner/The Hulk in such a great way and maybe look into rebooting the entire franchise.I would highly recommend this movie across all age ranges as there is something for everyone. I also cannot wait for this movie to come out on blu-ray.",10,4,7,12 August 2012
The Expendables," Very good!
","I enjoyed this movie very much, I thought all of the cast did very well. The action was also very good and there was a couple of things that made me chuckle. I was expecting Sylvester Stallone to be awful but he did very well and managed to do all the running around and fighting even at his age...I also thought the on screen partnership of Statham and Stallone was brilliant! Eric Roberts wasn't a fantastic bad guy though but Steve Austin was a great henchman, I even thought Bruce Willis' and Arnies cameos put a pretty good edge on the movie. I wouldn't have minded seeing Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren involved in the movie a little bit more.",9,1,6,11 September 2010

X-Men: First Class," One of the best X-Men films out of the series! *SOME SPOILERS*
",When i first heard that this movie was being made (Like Most X-Men fans) I was not entirely excited about this being made but as time went on and they started releasing publicity shots and mini trailers my anticipation grew. I went to the cinema last night and if i'm honest i was going without having the highest of expectations but after watching this boy was i blown away! The cast was absolutely perfect and the time between action and drama was spot on. The cameos that were chosen were great too with the typical Wolverine attitude which actually had the whole theatre laughing their heads off. There was lots of laughs when Mystique suddenly aged into the future Mystique. My only criticism of the movie was that some of the characters in the movies powers were not shown off enough. But still there really was a good amount of action as well as 'deep' scenes where we learn about the characters. It was a shame that we didn't get to see more of Edi Gatheg as i think he's a fantastic actor. Michael Fassbender was fantastic as Magneto. Overall i was thoroughly impressed and i am hoping to see a sequel in the pipeline as soon as possible. I would highly recommend people to go and see this.,9,2,5,2 June 2011
