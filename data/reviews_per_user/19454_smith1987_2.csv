50 First Dates," made me cry made laugh
",I think this movie is the finest example of romance in a different way.There are very few actors who can make you cry from their simple sad expression and make you feel good for a long day with a small smile and this is done by Drewberry More .She in the movie is so innocent and so likable person that one can fall in love with her in after seeing a small glimpse of her. This review is totally for her acting acting skill .Her innocence has always worked for her she is finest actor in the industry. Adam Sandler too has done a very good job their chemistry very likable .This film is made to watch again and again its a classic for me and can be seen in happy and sad mood,10,1,1,2 July 2013
Django Unchained," in simple just go for it
","yes it is that good. One must definitely go for it as this movie has all the important ingredient to make a movie wonderful keeping aside the cast of the movie still the movie is a delight to watch as it has a good script in it. Christoph Waltz acting is just fabulous I like this actor from Inglorious bastards .Its his way of speaking or he just make every single word from his mouth like pouring honey even when he his firing at some one he make such a good reason to why he did it. His character in the movie is about doing the things like the ways he wants . Jamie Foxx on the other hand has has also done the marvelous work, he and Christoph Waltz team up in the movie and start their journey to find Jamie Foxx wife with series of events in the journey Leonardo DiCaprio was very likable in the movie .He is like a chameleon as he can do anything he can do the impossible. I personally like him and has been great fan of his acting in his each and every film.overall the movie is very good with some blood shed here and there which I think was necessary to show as to make it more realistic .",7,2,7,20 June 2013
