Source Code," A good movie with weak and coward ending
","I really like Duncan Jones movies, the movie moves on really great, history and mistery is great 90% of time, do not look too original, but is agile and good to watch.
Jake made a good acting like him always do, not him top 10 but still good, the rest of the cast is good too, it's a small cast, but this is not really a problem, i like small cast.But there are several things about the movie they do not explain clearly, and i understand what they wanted do it this, but if everything was more simple like it supposed to be, the movie would conclude a lot better, had a time close to the end to be a perfect ending for the movie, and I'm said to the screen, well done Ducan Jones, end now... now... stop... and they did not have the guts to end the movie at that point, and they appeal to the 'hollywood way' everything's gonna be okay, this is not traggic, forget about, and ending ... why? Despite this, this is not a bad movie.",7,0,1,23 February 2018
A Quiet Place," Hide & Seek for your Lives
","This movie is surprisedly creative and very well done, everything is amazing here.To Begin, the story and script is totally great, There is not much voice talk, and that detail grants the movie have more attention, and when characters talk to each other is very tense and at low volume.How the sounds works on this movie is incredible good, everything is about it, when the silence turns to a minimal noise, the perceptive of this is very effective, this is so well done that make sense to deserve an indication in the oscars in both sound category.Every scene have an importance and tense moments, don't have any waste of time in this movie, they did a very creative scenes, making this movie function like a game for theirs lives, any sound over above the ambient will kill you, so every scene have this panic about that, and people are naturally noisy. This movie is close to a 10/10 for me, but i don't love the final moments. I expected something unexpected to make me feel surprised like the rest of the movie do, but this don't happen.I loved the interpretations of every character, making me really cares about this family since the first minutes, this is their intention and works. And Emily Blunt totally deserves an oscars indication, she's do a intensive and hard scene, the best i was watched this year into a movie.",9,0,1,30 June 2018
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," To everyone who loves Princess Mononoke
","I Can't believe i just discover Hayao Miyazaki most great movies only in 2018, i need to say 'Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi / Spirited Away' didn't get me like i wanted, and i just put this movies in the drawer, but now i finally watched some of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli movies and every single one have this magnificent beauty that i still can't explain exactly, like the mix of reality and fantasy so deep that sometimes make me forget that i'm watching an animated movie.This one is the precursor of 'Mononoke-hime / Princess Mononoke' but happens in the future, and is totally great and joyness to watch, the animation is sharp on the minimum details even for this days, for real it's is even better than a lot of animation movies from this days. The history is simple but is more and more actually with each passing day.
And how they make some futuristic flying Ships is just unbelievable for a movie of 1984, also everything in the world of this movie reminds me the game Final Fantasy VI (1994), i don't know why, but make me think about. And how cool would be an actual game of this history.",9,0,0,9 April 2018
Sicario," Sicario is just another regular policial movie.
","A very regular film, at first it excites a lot and has far reminded me Se7en. They did a great sequence of Action in the Mexico transit and which for me was the climax of the film, but after this, the movie just turn in a regular movie, just hunt down the villain and simply just showing us the true Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro character) who just wanted to take his revenge and would do anything for that, the film also tries to leave us with feelings by the family of the corrupt police but has failed. The strong point of the film is the performance of Benicio Del Toro, Emily Blunt and also the cinematography and directing, but the script is not enough.",7,0,3,22 December 2015
