Mission: Impossible III," Just a point of view
","The essence of this movie is basically the same as the first one. His boss is the bad guy who betrays his trust, and they're again in the black list, etc. I could think he dragged his relationship with Katty Holmes into the movie. His wife in this 3rd part is very look alike Katty. For that, I felt a little disappointed. But it's a good movie to watch, the action parts, as well as their performance and stunts, special effects were awesome!!..they did a wonderful job...since the beginning 'til the end you're like in so involved, that feels like was a short movie.Thumbs up!",7,0,0,11 May 2006
