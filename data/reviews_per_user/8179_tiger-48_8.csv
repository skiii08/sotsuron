Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Horrible
","I usually give reviews as if the reader has already seen the movie. Obviously I can't here since Star Wars:Episode I just came out last night so I'll be as vague as possible. It stunk.I walked into the theater with low expectations and I still walked out very disappointed. If that doesn't give a hint as to how bad a movie it was, here's another. As I was waiting in line for the premiere, there were TONS of Star Wars fanatics playing Star Wars Monopoly or having lightsaber battles in line. The excitement was HIGH! Then as everyone was seated in the theater, everyone cheered when the Lucasfilm logo appeared on the screen and then everyone cheered even more enthusiastically when the 'Star Wars' letters came up. By the end of the movie, not one single clap. I'm not even exaggerating. There was dead silence once the credits started rolling. The audience was left murmuring to themselves as they left the theater. Everyone felt ripped off.I guess it's not easy trying to follow up the legacy that is Star Wars. Almost anything that comes out with that title will have impossibly high standards to follow. But come on, this movie would have been a major disappointment if it was a prequel to 'The Last Starfighter'. I'll go briefly over what I didn't like about it, trying to avoid any spoilers along the way.Jar Jar Binks. This character was perhaps the single worst creation in movie history. I don't know WHAT George Lucas was thinking about here. Everyone I talked to after the movie couldn't STAND this guy. I've heard complaints about him even before the movie and well, once he appeared on the screen, the movie became nothing more than a cheese-ball festival. His manner of speech bordered on Jamaican and Chinese, and the accent was so indiscernible you couldn't even understand about 75% of the words coming out of his ugly mouth. He didn't single-handedly ruin the movie, but he certainly contributed to its failure.The plot. As opposed to what the critics say, this is NOT a children's film, based on the plot. It was muddled, confusing, and if I were a child I'd be sitting there without a clue of what was going on. Trade embargoes, taxation disputes, political fodder...it was all a mess. I don't know who Lucas was targeting with this movie. Little kids? No, they wouldn't understand the story. Adults? No, the action and humor were too immature and childish. It was like watching a cartoon, but mixed in with political wish-wash.The action. This movie tried way too hard to capture the magic of 'Return of the Jedi'. It shifted to several parallel battles, just as ROTJ often shifted from Lando's raid on the Death Star to the Ewok's battle to Luke's confrontation with Darth Vader. Unfortunately for Phantom Menace, none of the battles were very captivating or interesting. OK, maybe the lightsaber duel with Darth Maul was ultra-cool, but all the other stuff was just there to fill screen time. In all, the film moved VERY slowly. They tried associating everything too much with the latter films and I felt as if they were trying to desperately CONVINCE me that this mess was somehow connected to the whole Star Wars universe.About the only redeeming quality the movie had were its actors. Liam Neeson was a great Jedi Knight and Ewan McGregor nailed his performace of Obi-Wan Kenobi. But extra special kudos to Natalie Portman who absolutely stole the show! Man, is she a little hottie or what??!! Little Annakin Skywalker also did a formidable job and Samuel Jackson was fun to watch as Jedi Councilmember, Mace Windu. But despite the good casting, the acting in this movie did not do a single thing to save the mess of a movie this was.The bad guys. Darth Maul was a menacing figure, alright. But we don't really hate him at all. His character is so incomplete we have no real opinion of him. He has one or two lines the entire movie! The rest of his scenes are comprised of him wielding his lightsaber lance (which was pretty damned cool, but that's not the point). The Viceroys were VERY VERY annoying. They couldn't speak a word of coherent English and we're left to try and decipher their mutterings as the muddled plot speeds on by. In all, the character designs in this movie were horrible. Besides Darth Maul, there were no interesting new creations whatsoever.So without getting into the plot or spoiling the film for anyone, this is the most complete review I can do with this movie. Perhaps I'll get into it more when people have actually seen the movie, but for now, just know that this movie was perhaps the single greatest disappointment in my movie-going career. I was itching to leave the theater after the first hour, but the thing ran for over 2 hours. It was bad, folks. My review should NOT stop you from seeing it, however. You'll need to decide for yourself obviously, but if I could, I'd tell Lucas to recall every copy of this film and start over from scratch because EVERYTHING needs to be re-worked. It's sad to see the Star Wars franchise soiled by an entry like this.Oops...one last note. The special effects in the movie were AWESOME! Probably one of the most technically outstanding films I've ever seen. Unfortunately, the special effects also happened to be the main character in the film.",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
Beauty and the Beast," #1 Film of All-Time
","For me, all great movies are measured upon how they compare to Beauty and the Beast. In my opinion, this piece of magic is the very best that cinema has ever offered us.I was not a big fan of animated movies at all before I watched this movie. I found them to be childish, shallow, and detached. However, as I walked dizzily out of the theater for Beauty and the Beast, I was struck immediately with the sense that I had just watched the greatest spectacle of all-time. It usually takes me a good 2-3 days after I watch a movie to really appreciate it. I appreciated THIS movie even before the end credits showed up.Never before have I seen a movie so many times...28 times and counting. To me, this defines perfection in movies. There is no movie to date that can match B&B's splendor, from the beautiful music to the breath-taking animation, this film is chock-full of emotions. I could go on and on about this film, but I'll just leave it here with one grand statement. I've seen over 300 films in my lifetime and NONE have ever matched the magic and splendor of Beauty and the Beast.ps - The Academy has forever lost its legitimacy when Beauty and the Beast lost to Unforgiven for Best Picture.",Null,0,0,6 April 1999
Face_Off," Woo's Hollywood masterpiece
","For anyone who has seen 'The Killer' or 'Hard-Boiled', you probably will not be blown away by 'Face/Off'. As good as Face/Off may seem, we have to remember it is still given the Hollywood treatment. Less guns, less bullets, less death, and a happy ending. Of course, for the regular neutered American filmgoer, this seems like a GOOD thing. But for REAL hardened action fans, this Hollywood intervention is an unwelcome intrusion. For all the fireworks in Face/Off, it still does not even come close to matching up with even ten minutes of 'Hard-Boiled' or 'The Killer'. These two Hong Kong movies are John Woo's REAL masterpieces, not tied down by any ropes or watered-down to fit the standards of any major movie company.However, that being said, Face/Off is certainly a masterpiece in American standards. Woo manages to still offer us an energetic and eye-pleasing action movie despite being tied down by Hollywood. The plot in this movie, while comical, is very engaging. A little known fact about this movie is that it was originally meant to be set in the future. That would better explain the validity of the operation AND that wacky futuristic prison. However, Woo refused to do this, and the movie is much better because of it.The complications of Castor Troy turning into Sean Archer and vice versa are brilliant. Sean turns into the very man he has loathed and despised. He is reminded of him every time he looks in the mirror. Castor, on the other hand, turns into the man who has been chasing him with passion for years. This turn of events causes major psychological trauma for both characters (although Cage's character shows it a lot more). The extent of these emotions are limited on screen as Woo chooses to push that aspect of the story away and instead focus on the action. Good choice!Make no bones about it, this is not a psychological drama. It has John Woo behind the camera, so it's a full-tilt action film. As in his Hong Kong films, Woo manages to make EVERYONE look more cool than they really are. Case in point, has Cage EVER looked cooler than the opening scene when he exits his car and his overcoat goes flapping around in the wind?The most brilliant example of Woo's genius is the scene when Cage and Travolta are back-to-back with each other with only a mirror separating them. When they both turn away and point guns at each other's image, you can't help but get chills at how brilliant this is. They're both pointing their guns at the very man they hate, and even though it is really themselves, shooting at that image could kill the enemy. As complicated as it is smart, Face/Off has many scenes that envoke chills like this.And of course, the raw unorthodoxed action...the only moment that this film felt like a Hong Kong movie was the scene when Cage slides on the floor to shoot at the SWAT member breaking into their hideout. The camera follows Cage sliding on the ground while sparks fly all around him. This just screamed Hong Kong action all the while and it was beautiful! The final church shootout was ripped off from 'The Killer' (but severely diluted), and the boat scene was also something out of 'The Killer'. That being said, both were well-done and actually made the movie!The plot does seem a bit far-fetched, but it is as interesting as it is implausible. People need to stop looking at this film as a true-life action film and start looking at it like a sci-fi film (since that's what it was originally supposed to be). That is, keep your mind open and you won't be tied down by the physics and technology of today. Take the story as it is and breathe in the premise of the story and not the reality of it. Seen in that light, Face/Off is certainly an action masterpiece and one that John Woo should be proud of despite its lack of punch and flair that was present in The Killer and Hard-Boiled.",Null,1,2,5 April 1999
Dark City," All-time great movie!!
","Out of my personal top 5 list of all-time favorite movies, there are 2 comedies, 2 dramas, and 1 sci-fi film. Not being a huge sci-fi fan, I was SHOCKED at how brilliant and engaging Dark City was. It was simply one of the greatest film achievements of all-time. It was not just sci-fi....it was part mystery, part drama, and all heart!I first watched this film on my little 20-inch TV, and the visuals still managed to take my breath away. The biggest gripe I've seen by other viewers on this film was the confusing first 30 minutes. However, I thought this was one of the most brilliant aspects of the film. We basically lived the life of John Murdock. We know just as little as he knows and we experience things just as he experiences them. How can you possibly get more immersed into the story than that? Most people nowadays are used to mindless story telling where all the answers are revealed right away. We live in a short-attention span world. It's great to see a movie that doesn't conform to these standards.The plot and storyline of the movie were brilliant. I found it very easy to follow and instantly grabbing. I made my cousin watch it recently and she enjoyed every second of it. She too found the plot well done and easy to follow. I think in general, that people who hated the plot weren't paying too much attention in the first place and were spending most of the time in the theater thinking of how to make the moves on their date. The second category of people who didn't like the plot were just idiots who just watched 'The Waterboy' the other day.In all, I felt this to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It was as bold as it was beautiful. The ending was great! I loved the fact that Jennifer Connolley's character became re-programmed and was basically a new person that John had to woo all over again. It really embraced the concept of everyone having a fresh start.I give it an 11 out of 10!!",Null,0,1,18 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," overrated
","OK, so I was obviously not part of WWII, or ANY war for that matter. Even so, I have seen some GREAT war movies in my time that made me feel like I was actually there and going through the emotions and struggles that all soldiers experience in battle.So why am I calling Saving Private Ryan overrated when it's been touted as the most realistic war movie ever made? It just didn't have the emotion. Sure, it looked grisly on the screen, especially the first 15 minutes. But I never got a sense that I was there...that I was feeling what Tom Hanks was feeling. In fact, I felt as if I were sitting in a movie theater watching a movie. The special effects in the first 15 minutes were also very bad. I cringed at the corniness whenever they had a scene with a downed soldier playing with his innards. It looked more like spaghetti than intestines and was an obvious device for shock value (which did not work one single bit).The story itself was interesting enough. However, it was very limited, if you think about it. The movie transformed itself from a dramatic war movie to a simple action flick about searching for an ordinary soldier and then taking on an entire German unit with 6 or 7 soldiers. It reminded me more of Rambo than an Oscar-nominated movie.The two best war movies I have ever seen both came out in the same year. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket were REAL war movies. I absolutely fell in love with Platoon when I watched it. I actually felt like I was there in the jungle with Charlie company and I knew all the soldiers in my troop. It was an experience. Saving Private Ryan never really puts you there. Instead, it drags you along and makes you follow a bunch of guys walking around the whole movie looking for this private Ryan guy.The movie was 'important' because it was about WWII and because Steven Spielberg was involved. Spielberg has reached the status where he can do no wrong and everything he comes out with is considered a masterpiece. If he were to make a film about origami, everyone would suddenly embrace origami as the greatest lost art of our time and there would be conventions and books and tributes about how great origami is.Saving Private Ryan is a product of a well-respected director and actor making the best out of their reputations. As a film, it is certainly not the best movie I've seen, and even not the best I've seen last year (Life is Beautiful and Dark City takes the cake on that). It is more of an action flick than a human drama and mroe about making money than it is about war.While I still enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed it on the same plane as a regular action flick. If put next to a film like Life is Beautiful or Platoon, it certainly takes a back seat.",Null,0,1,25 March 1999
Life Is Beautiful," great expectations
","I watched this movie a few weeks ago before the Oscars. I heard all the hype about it and I've seen Roberto Benigni on various talk shows here in the US so I knew him to be as energetic and verbose as they come. So naturally I walked into the theater expecting to laugh my socks off!What I got instead was maybe only two or three roaringly funny moments while the rest of the humor fell short (like many of Whoopie Goldberg's many failed attempts at humor at the Oscars). However, it is not primarily the humor that makes this movie great...it's the message and the heart.This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder whether or not you should be laughing at any of the jokes because it's set in a brutal Nazi concentration camp. You spend the first few moments writhing uncomfortably in the theater as Benigni whips out joke after joke once they reach the camp. Then you can't help but suddenly burst out laughing at his mock translation of the German soldier. (the funniest moment in the film!)It's a scene that lifts the tension and makes the viewer realize that the whole point of the movie is not to make light of the situation, but to try and mask the situation through humor. The movie is so touching when you realize that all his efforts, all his energy, and all his thoughts went into protecting his son. Through the days of hard labour, he always comes back to his son wildly happy and full of anticipation that they will someday win their 'prize'.While I somewhat doubt that his son, who seemed very intelligent at the beginning of the movie, would fall for the charade for so long, I think the premise of the movie is very touching and effective. 'Life is Beautiful' is an appropriately named because it illustrates to everyone that life can be beautiful no matter what the situation or the backdrop. Horrifying moments and situations can take away certain aspects of life, but it can never take away from the human spirit. This is one of the many points to this film and while I did not laugh as much as I thought I would, I walked away from the movie theater with a smile on my face and a joyous outlook on life.Congratulations to Roberto Benigni to making such a fine film. I felt it deserved every award it has garnered and I even dare say it should have won for Best Picture. I enjoyed it far more than Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Shakespeare in Love.",Null,1,2,23 March 1999
Platoon," The GREATEST war movie ever
","I've seen them all. Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, Deer Hunter...and the list goes on. Platoon is, by far, the greatest war movie ever made. It affected me the very first time I saw it in 1988, and still affects me even today. Oliver Stone has created one of the great cinematic masterpieces of all-time.The praise for Saving Private Ryan is very distressing mostly because most of the good things being said of it are all done better in Platoon (perhaps that's why Platoon WON for Best Picture). While it wasn't as grisly or graphic as Saving Private Ryan, I felt utterly more appalled by the violence and reality of war in Platoon. For the first time, I felt as if I was actually IN the movie, experiencing war as the soldiers experienced it. And it was horrifying. I was constantly afraid that the next step would set off a trap, or there were Viet Cong soldiers lurking somewhere in the trees. It was the most nerve-wracking experience I've ever had in a movie. It scared me more than any horror film I've ever seen, yet, it's that very fear that makes the ultimate statement in the movie.Stone paints a gruesome picture of war through they eyes of one soldier. Charlie Sheen's subdued performance is perfect for this film. We can literally see his tranformation from a clueless green soldier to a gritty, experienced veteran of war. It's a transformation that we as viewers can follow and understand. We all experience his emotions, fears, and curiosity about war. And we are taken along for the ride without any veils pulled over our eyes.This film is far and away the greatest war movie ever. It illustrates both the good and bad about American soldiers and war in general. War can sometimes turn grown men into monsters. It can sometimes turn monsters into grown men. Oliver Stone does a brilliant job in illustrating this. his decision to narrate the story through Charlie Sheen's character is both effective and brilliant. It provides the audience with an understanding and a face to attach the horror to.In so many ways this movie is superior to Private Ryan. Its story is universal and broad while its focus is perfectly condensed and realized.Bravo to Platoon!",Null,0,0,29 March 1999
The Matrix," What is the Matrix?
","It took the movie a good hour or so before you had any real idea what the Matrix was. There's a lot of explaining by Morpheus and Trinity, but none of it actually becomes clear until halfway through the movie. Does this take away from the enjoyment of the movie? Not so, partly because we are drawn to the question AND because we can take solace in the movie's breath-taking visuals.In all, this was a solid piece of sci-fi filmmaking. There were elements of mystery, technological mutiny, questions about humanity...you know, the usual sci-fi stuff. However, the story was original enough to make it better than your avergae run-of-the-mill movie.Solidifying his reputation as Hollywood's worst actor, Keanu Reeves gives us yet another laughable performance, but as in Speed, he is fortunate to find himself in a very good movie which forces us to look past his performance. His supporting cast is rock solid, which is bad for him since it really makes him stand out as a bad actor. In particular, Laurence Fishburne does a wonderful Morpheus. He appears both invincible and vulnerable at the same time, omnipotent yet confused. His is the best performance in the film by far, but of course, we ARE comparing him to Keanu Reeves.The coolest scene in the movie has to be the lobby shoot-out. Granted, it's basically a rehash of every John Woo/Hong Kong action sequence ever made, down to the two-fisted gun play, flowing black cape, slo-mo action, and explosions galore. I guess I'm just a sucker for these scenes since it's a reminder of Mr. Woo's contribution to Hollywood action movies.In all, THe Matrix will likely grab you and make for a very entertaining movie experience. Like any sci-fi film, however, you will have to walk in with a VERY open mind and expect to concentrate on the movie ONLY (and not your date). If you don't pay attention, you'll miss the story and be left with some neat-o visuals to fill the time. Dark City still takes the cake as the best sci-film of the decade, but The Matrix definitely comes in a close third or fourth.",Null,0,0,5 April 1999
