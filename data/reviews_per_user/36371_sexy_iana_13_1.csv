","A+ For The Avengers I must say from the film 'The Avengers' I believe it is one of the best action hero movies ever made. I expected it to be a great movie for the simple fact that they had the Hulk , Thor , and several other big name heroes in it. But this movie really blew me away with how they constructed it. The way they brought all the characters together in the storyline , and had them all be able to connect and shows that each knew of each other already to me was amazing. The film also brought a lot of action and one on one fights. Which I believe everyone who is a fan of these films loved because the question is always asked who the best superhero is. But besides the fighting each other there were a lot of action in New York that just blows your mind, the nonstop adrenaline, anticipating what will happen next just have you on the edge of your seat, biting your finger nails. I believe the actors/actresses did an amazing job on portraying these characters. They really brought them to life and interconnect them. I personally never saw Thor the movie, but he brought it in this movie to where I didn't need to go watch that movie first. Thor and Hoki had a moment where it explains what they are and who they are. I like how they brought that out it really makes the film that much better. And also I like how when they go to recruit it shows a little about every person but not too much these characters were played at their best. Costumes and props where amazing, from iron man's new suits, to captain America actually still wearing his new suite in the current life. And Thors hammer that you believed was real from the sound effects. The Avengers brought there A game with this film. Creating a reflection, flying ship that looks invisible. The new technology they brought to this movie I would have never thought of. One last thing I liked how they showed the avengers departing and going back to their daily lives, but also leaves you to think maybe there will be another movie. Guess we will just have to wait and see for ourselves. But if so it also leaves you wondering just what will the second film be about since that just swept everything I've imagined it to be",10,2,6,19 November 2012
