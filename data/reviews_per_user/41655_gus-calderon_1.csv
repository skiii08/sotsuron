Skyfall," Why insisting in making an emotional James Bond?
","Once again they tried to have a more 'human' James Bond with feelings and all the crap... James Bond is not like that, he likes women, he kill bad guys, he does incredible things, he uses super high tech weapons, he always use the best brand new cars and he never shows emotions. In this film they tried to evoke the Sean Connery era with an emotional 007 with a very dumb story. At least he still likes women, tough he leaves open the idea that he might have tried other than women. All of that would be OK in a different movie, but it is James Bond. On the other hand, the theater was crowded and most of the people seamed to be very happy with the movie, it has a high rating at the IMDb, so I guess there must be something about this movie that people just loved it. I am sorry, but I couldn't find it.I usually never notice the goofs, but this movie has a lot of them. It is a shame, it looks like such an expensive movie with one of the current best directors and a wonderful cast, was not enough, they missed a good story and a good script.",5,2,9,6 November 2012
