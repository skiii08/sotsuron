Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it...
","It is clear to me now, after viewing The Phantom Menace, that George Lucas has completely and utterly lost touch with the magic that made A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back so special.  I did not like Return of the Jedi, because it was oriented too much toward slapstick and general cuteness, and hoped that George Lucas would have gotten it out of his system by now. Not so.  The Phantom Menace is a shallow, special effects extravaganza without an ounce of spirit.  There is so little dramatic impact in this film that I could barely muster enough interest in what was going on to even care. Not that it mattered, really, because you could sleep through a quarter of this film without missing anything important.  There are way, way ,way too many scenes that exist simply to showcase alien creatures doing silly things. Return of the Jedi was criticized for lacking substance and being cartoonish for over a decade, yet Lucas didn't seem to pay attention. He should have. By the time the big duel takes place between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights, I had to really force myself to be emotionally involved.  Though the fight is quite impressive, maybe even dazzling, the characters weren't developed enough for me to care.  I am vehement in my disappointment, and will gladly share it with anyone who is going to see this empty spectacle. I hope this movie fails, though I know it won't, so George Lucas might finally get the point.",6,1,2,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The film is lackluster, just accept it!
","The Phantom Menace is absolutely, positively NOT a good movie by any rational standard.  I've been reading some of the user comments and I am astounded at the complete lack of thought behind them.  It seems to me that many people are defiantly praising this movie just because they think that they're supposed to.  If  you were to judge The Phantom Menace by the same standard used for any other movie (acting, story, plot, dialogue... heard of these?), you simply could not consider it any more than mediocre.  No movie is immune to criticism, Star Wars or not.  As someone who is old enough to remember seeing the original trilogy at the theater, I was very excited to see The Phantom Menace.  Hype had nothing to do with it.  I wanted to enjoy it.  I was ready to enjoy it.  Sadly, instead of the prequel to a classic science fiction series, I was subjected to two hours of The Galaxy's Goofiest Aliens.  Anybody who has the audacity to say that this disappointing mess is equal to, or better(!), than the original movies is profoundly deluded or just has terminally bad taste.  Make no mistake-THIS MOVIE WAS BAD!  Special effects cannot save it, nor can a bunch of so-called fans offering unfounded praise.  I Give it a little thought and you'll know what I say is true.",6,0,1,24 May 1999
The Big Lebowski," An inspiration for those who don't want to do anything!!!!
","The Big Lebowski is a beautiful and empowering film, a film that an entire life philosophy can be based upon. Filled with human, though mentally challenged and/or psychotic, characters that anyone can understand, The Big Lebowski allows you to feel as though you are not alone in life, regardless of how pathetic yours may be.  The rollicking scene where one of the film's antagonists, Jesus, first appears is emblazened in my soul for now and all time.",Null,0,1,12 May 1999
The Fifth Element," This movie really irritated me!!!
","When I started watching the Fifth Element, I was impressed with the imaginative effects and setting.  But as the movie progressed, it became more and more cartoonish and obnoxious.  Mila Jovovich is way, way, way too cutesie for the importance of her character to the story and Chris Tucker serves absolutely no purpose at all.  And the ending is so artificial that I almost vomited.  It's one of those 'love conquers all' deals, but it's seemingly thrown together at the last minute.  The Fifth Element had promise, but threw it all away.",Null,0,1,14 May 1999
Event Horizon," If your imagination gets away from you, don't see this.
","My mind often kicks into overdrive whenever I see a disturbing movie, often analyzing the scenes repeatedly, which disturbs me even further.  I swear I dwelled on this movie for weeks.  Some of the scenes are REALLY unpleasant. Between the creepy hallucinations and unnerving violence, anybody who looks under their bed after seeing a horror movie will be petrified after seeing this.  I imagined some really terrifying things, and couldn't sleep well for quite some time.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
Titanic," One cliche after another
","The one thing that the Titanic contributed to our culture is the fact that the film managed to get a lot of giggly teenage girls to sit for three hours.  No small feat.  But after hearing so many people triumphantly declare that they sat through the Titanic twice, four times, ten times, ect., I began to get upset.  There are a heck of a lot of better three hour movies they could have seen.  The truth is, Titanic is loaded with cliches and has problems with historical accuracy. And did that old woman REALLY deserve a Best Actress nomination?  Still, to its credit, the love story was fairly well done, but if it wasn't set on the Titanic it wouldn't have been worth filming.",Null,2,3,14 May 1999
