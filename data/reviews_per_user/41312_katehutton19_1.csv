Catch Me If You Can," The Satisfying Ironic: A Critical Review of Catch Me If You Can
","This film is a thoughtfully arranged drama-biographical narrative based on the life story of Mr. Frank William Abagnale, Jr. that tag-lines as, 'The true story of a real fake'. Although this story lacks violence, blood, murder, and other stereotypical understandings of this genre, this film reinforces its true crime integrity through the criteria use of narrative style, the text at the finale, the explanation for the evil, and the psychological understanding of this true, blue collar crime. All in all, this 2002 film, Catch Me If You Can, directed by Steven Spielberg cleverly captures the loopholes found in the criminal justice system, not only in the police force but the Federal Bureau of Investigation, making this film a true crime reflection as well as an explanation as to why the accessibility of actual criminal minds is necessary in these judicial forces to ensure safety and justice. This film is not only well written, entertaining, and includes a star-studded cast, but it also has a deeper meaning, a real life application, and new ideas for the viewer to think about after the credible finale; therefore ultimately earning my vote of a full, ten out of ten production.",10,2,3,8 December 2013
