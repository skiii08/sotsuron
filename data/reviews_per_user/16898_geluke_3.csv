Ford v Ferrari," No words!!
","This movie is truly one of the biggest thing on 2019.
It's so accurate, sharp, so timely, interesting convos, it's beautifully made.
Cast is indeed another thing, I mean, who's not gonna love two legends on screen in such an awesome, action movie. Bale is our treasure and so is Matt too.
For those who have not seen this movie yet, even if you are not a fan of action genre, tou have to see it. It's not some kind of made up tale, it is a history.
Absolutely loved it.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Amazing work
","Honestly, this is the movie of an ages. I don't know why i missed it to see up to now. And can't believe Leo kissed an oscar for this fascinating work.",10,1,1,25 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Long and Kind of Boring
","I loved the trilogy, specially first two movies were revolutionary. Which I can't say about the this part. Movie itself was so long and i felt like it was boring sometimes. Batman was just so week, basically as a suited up regular human.
Cast was great as in all movies.",5,1,4,19 March 2020
