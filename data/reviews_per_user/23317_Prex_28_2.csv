First Man," A boring moon landing.
","I just rated this movie with a generous 6,because of costumes and the scenary.End.About the film, I find it extremely slow to see and too much claustrophobic. Neil Armstrong seems to be the most glacial astronaut of the world, showing no emotion, keeping the same face expression along all the film. Buzz Aldrin is forgotten and he's depicted as a moron played by Corey Stoll. Looks like that all the work about getting to the Moon was done by Ryan Gosling.I don't know what to say more...yeah, that's just a movie for real Ryan Gosling fan and even space junkies.This movie doesn't deserve an oscar, trust me.Not recommended at all.",6,0,1,6 May 2019
Bird Box," Too much hyped
","I've simply have seen this movie, because it was advertised pretty much everywhere. I think it's pretty hard, to genre it as an horror movie: yeah, we got some bloody part, but nothing scary at all.
It was too long and it could have last 30 min less.Watch just if you're bored.",6,1,5,10 January 2019
