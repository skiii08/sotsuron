Hereditary," Headache inducing movie
","I saw that this movie got good reviews so I decided to grab some snacks and give it a shot. I only managed to watch until they started with the spirits and ghosts, then I had to take a nap. I thought it was going to get better... It didn't. The actors and actresses are super unattractive aswell which might have contributed to the headache this weird movie gave me. If youre into ghost movies, watch the conjuring, if you're into psycho movies watch incident in a ghost land. But this? It just didn't make any sense and left me confused",2,0,4,16 February 2019
A Quiet Place," Should have been a TV show
","It felt as though the movie was made out of 10 long scenes. Don't get me wrong, they were all very intense and thrilling, it just didn't quite feel like a proper movie, it felt like an episode of what could be an amazing TV show. For example Spoiler warning!! They could have made episodes about the other families that survived and in the season Finale they could learn how to defeat the aliens. It is a good story but it just needs more developing and more details, we never really find out what the alien is and why it's killing things that make a sound",7,0,3,16 September 2018
