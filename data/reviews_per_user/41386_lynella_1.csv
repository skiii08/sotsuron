The Ring," Horse cruelty?
","Hmmmmm, does anyone else have nightmares about horses now!? What a sick, perverse way to shoot a scene. Yes, I know it wasn't REAL. But some things don't have to BE real to seem real. I went to see a scary movie, but what I saw was a true horror.",Null,0,0,20 November 2002
