Mission: Impossible III," A little schizophrenic about this one....
","Mission Impossible 3's trailers left me slobbering at the mouth. Hoffman seemed like a cunning, conniving (and emotionally intense) villain... juicy, given how well he does in other roles. There was the love interest which seemed to look credible in the few shots that it's presented... The action looked intense, and there was the good ol' music theme.What could go wrong? Well, first of all, I felt that it did go wrong. Secondly, all the cool bits in the trailer were the problems in the film. The first half hour shows so much of Ethan maintaining his double life with his fianc√©e, that I just wanted it to continue. There are some good scenes for setting up later events, but there's just too much there. The romance also could have been toned down.I normally like a movie to get into the details about characters and relationships, but it felt inappropriate here. Mission Impossible should be about Ethan Hunt completing an impossible mission, but it gets bogged down by the exposition. If it were released under a non-franchise name, it would probably have gone down better with me.Another detractor was Hoffman. He looked like a deliciously complex villain in the trailers, and a volatile one at that. But what you see in the trailers is not what you get in the film. Hoffman spends 95% of his screen time without facial expression or vocal intonation. It's supposed to convey that he is (likely) sociopathic... so is every other Hollywood villain. He has one great scene (the opening scene). His personal vendetta against Hunt seemed half baked, and we never learn anything about him.Other than Hoffman, the other performances were very good. Rhames rebounds with flair from his walk-in-the-park role in Mi-2. Cruise and his girlfriend seemed authentic on the screen, and Cruise even gets quite intense (again the topper is the opening scene). The characters share a lot of humorous banter (Luther criticizes Ethan's love life while on mission, while occasionally switching back to discussing the mission)...In my opinion, the film could have been absolutely superb, but it either tried too hard (the romance) or not enough (Hoffman).",6,7,16,3 May 2006
Avatar," Extraordinary? Yes! Revolutionary? No...
","Just came from the morning screening of Avatar on opening day in Brisbane...Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way first. The effects are completely photo real! The 3D is sensational! The Na'vi performances are scarily authentic! But let's not dwell on that because everyone else is gushing on those points. Let's talk about the problems, because they are there...First, the story. There's nothing really wrong with the story. Jake (Sam Worthington) infiltrates an alien race using his avatar to provide intelligence and to convince them to move as they rest on a valuable mineral deposit. He learns their customs and falls in love with one of them and is forced to choose between honoring his contract or defending his new friends. The story is well structured and well paced - despite running for three hours - but there are no surprises. You know that Jake's loyalty will be challenged and that gun-happy Col Quaritch (Stephen Lang) will declare war on the native tribe. It's great to watch it unfold but I can't help but wish for more suspense in not knowing what would happen...Second, the performances. Neytiri is a fantastic character and Zoe Saldana plays her perfectly. She is strong and wise, yet vulnerable and feminine. She is also surprisingly hot for a non-human. She is the heart of the film. Stephen Lang provides the balls as Quaritch. He is one tough son of a b*tch in this movie and Lang's great voice and physique really sell that this is a character you don't want to enrage. However, everyone else is only average. Sam Worthington was fine as a leading man and some of his awkward attempts to integrate into the tribe are great, but he's not very engaging on an emotional level. Sigourney Weaver doesn't really do anything to justify her casting - her role could have been played by any middle-aged woman.Third, the 3D... now for 99.5% of the film, it's beautiful and perfect. But every now and then, objects in the extreme foreground seemed to lose the 3D effect and become the 'I'm seeing double' effect you would get if you saw the film without the glasses. That was a little distracting... What was worse was the way we see the world. In wide shots, it's fine because we see the world in wide shots. However, in closeups where the depth of field is shallow, it looks unnatural. I think this is because we don't see the world in a telephoto lens or with such a narrow depth of field. And while the brain is convinced of the 3D effect, you can't get focus on the background and that irritated my eyes a little.Now this is by no means a bad film. It is a fantastic film. On a cinematic level, the world Cameron presents is so real and so organic that you can't help but get drawn into it. You are convinced that this world exists. For the first time since Jurassic Park, I actually had to pinch myself to remember that those exterior locations are completely computer generated because they didn't just look realistic... they actually were real in my mind.Lastly, I loved the themes in this film and how he depicts them in the story. I'm no Greenpeace activist, but I believe in generally keeping things natural and whilst I'm not religious, I do consider myself spiritual. James Cameron really impressed me as he deals with nature and spirituality-slash-mysticism in this film and manages to explain it through biology and chemistry rather than implying any sort of holy deity. For that I commend him as other films such as I am Legend have lost points for implying a specific religion when it should have been more generic... after all how do we know that it's God and not Allah or Buddha? Or Zeus? So kudos to Cameron for his decisions in the film.The biggest hype about the film was that it was going to reinvent the way movies are made. I disagree. While the 3D enhances the experience of seeing this incredible world, it isn't essential. It's still like any other film that uses shot choices and editing so it isn't really anything new. It's certainly a step forward for the industry, but it isn't the leap they were hoping for.",8,9,19,17 December 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the Sith vs The Rest
","I went to the midnight screening of Revenge of the Sith with unusually high hopes (positive reviews, but Episodes I and II brooding in my mind).Dialogue is a weak point as well as line delivery during the early scenes. But, Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor were somehow incredible to watch despite this, and I'm not even referring to their climactic duel. Hayden was able to find Anakin's depressing (and even confused, I think) anger within himself and portrays it epically. Ewan was equally as good at showing Obi-Wan's emotional stance when confronting Anakin and coming to terms with the failure of the republic.A lot of comment has been made about how dark this movie is compared to the rest of the series, but I think this is due to the comical nature of the opening act. R2-D2 shows some attitude in the opening battle, as well as some hilarious tactics. I think the dark aspect of the film The film is surprisingly dramatic, considering George Luca's dedication to audiovisual experience of film, as opposed to emotional. The fall of the Jedi, Anakin's betrayal of the Jedi Order and his father figure Obi-Wan. Even Mace Windu has a poignant moment.I felt that there are some flaws. As mentioned before dialog needed work, but also I felt that Padme and C3-P0 were reduced to plot devices for the other characters. C3-P0 was nothing more than the butler whose shoulder is just in shot. He could've been left out entirely and people wouldn't have noticed. The ending is a little overlong, but ultimately necessary to make things gel between the trilogies, and considering what has to happen, it's quite well done.So this is how I think the series pans out:Revenge of the Sith (the most emotionally powerful)Return of the Jedi (not quite the same emotional intensity, but up there)Empire Strikes Back (Very strong character development and great battle on Hoth)Star Wars (thought this was very flawed, but better than the other prequels)Attack of the Clones (cos it wasn't as bad as Menace, and it had Clone Wars)The Phantom Menace (cos it's Menace!)",9,2,4,19 May 2005
