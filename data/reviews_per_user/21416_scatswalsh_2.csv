War Dogs," War Dogs - A Different Movie the Second Time Around
","Some movies are exactly the same every time you see them. Todd Phillips's The Hangover is a perfect example. It is my go-to film anytime I'm blue and need a laugh. It is always the same stupidly funny movie that makes me laugh in all the same places ('Not you, fat Jesus..'). The same director does something very different with War Dogs. I loved this film when I saw it in the movies so I knew I'd enjoy it again recently on DVD. In the theater I thought it was funny - a great buddy film featuring two former middle school friends who reconnect and have an amazing adventure. Jonah Hill's character seems a brash, funny wheeler-dealer - the kid who always has big ideas. By the end of the film you see him for who he really is - a much darker, malignant personality - cunning and manipulative with no regard for others. And that is what makes War Dogs so different the second time around. The scenes he made funny and maybe a little endearing the first time you watch are much darker on second viewing as you see how he pulls people into his web. It was fascinating to see the same movie twice and get such a different feel the second time - if you liked War Dogs, it is definitely worth a repeat watching.",9,2,3,11 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Surprised and Delighted..... Not Your Typical Comic Book Hero Film
","I can't add much for die hard GOTG fans but for those who might be on the fence about seeing this or dreading having to sit through it with your kids - GO ! Full disclosure - I saw this film in the main auditorium at the Senator Theater in Baltimore, MD - and that makes any film better. In 2014 Men's Journal listed the Senator among the top 20 movie theaters in the world. I had low expectations for this - not particularly a sci-fi fan, not particularly a comic book movie fan - I expected to be by far the oldest person in the theater - but it was a rainy day, and it was the film chosen to entertain a young family member, so off we went. First, I was surprised by the make up of the audience - lots of family groups, and lots of older viewers - I was not sitting in a sea of teens as I expected. This movie was simply put great entertainment. The characters were well fleshed out, the acting was stellar, and it was funny - laugh out loud funny. You have to love running jokes about David Hasselhoff, and I'm still wondering exactly how they pulled off the 'Benjamin Button' reverse aging of Kurt Russell in the opening scene! Don't pass this up just because you aren't a fan of the genre - it is much more - fun and entertaining !",8,2,5,6 May 2017
