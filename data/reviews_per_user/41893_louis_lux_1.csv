Sucker Punch," Exactly what the trailers promised
","If you thought the trailer and plot summary seemed silly then by all means listen to the critics and don't go see it, but if you were excited by the trailers and thought the story might be interesting then I advise you to go see it.The first and third trailer and part of the second were not your average trailer, they had barely any dialog and you basically got that sick action to the sound of some wicked music. That's exactly what's in the movie, and frankly talking would just have ruined it, the action and music are all you need.From the trailer we can tell that Scott Glenn says the cheesiest lines and it's so cheesy compared to the other characters that there's just no way it's not intentional, but he actually does it quite well, the guys in the Expendables movie wish they could say cheesy lines so well.Like I said, the other actors are nothing like Scott Glenn's character, who resides in the imaginary, they are all flesh and blood and have deep emotions. The middle section of the movie is quite intense and I dare anyone to say anything bad about Oscar Isaac's performance, he was great throughout. The girls are very good too and honestly made some action stars look bad in comparison.Now I really have to mention again that the middle portion of the movie, that takes place in the train with the robots and what follows, is the highlight of the movie, if the rest of the movie had matched that part critics would be seeing the movie in a much more positive light. It features the best action, the stakes at hand are tangible and an already intense scene gets even more intense when Blue lays down the law, again incredible performance by Oscar Isaac.",6,5,12,25 March 2011
