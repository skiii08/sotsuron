Casablanca," Casablanca
","A Beloved American classic, Casablanca is well-renowned in the cinema world. Starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and his love interest, Ilsa Lund Laszio as Ingrid Bergman, Casablanca is a romance drama story taking place in Casablanca during the start of WWII. Rick runs a nightclub and also sells tickets of transit, allowing refugees to escape from the Nazis, when one day his former love interest Ilsa and well known rebel Victor Lazio (Paul Henried) enters his club, bringing back past emotions and rekindling their love. Aside from it's excellent story, Casablanca is also excellently made. Its dialog, despite being over 70 years old, remains fresh. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's acting is outstanding. The Photography is is perfect, every shadow and every light is expertly placed. Casablanca is one of Hollywood's finer moments to be sure.",10,1,2,9 May 2014
The Graduate," The sounds of silence
","I've always been a fan of comedies, and The Graduate is no exception. With its unique comedic sense, starting off strong with the awkward and shy Ben Braddock being seduced by the middle-aged Mrs. Robinson, The Graduate will surely bring laughter to viewers of all kinds (despite it's 60's focus). It's only real fault is that it isn't exactly believable at times, but it's to be expected from a comedy.Besides it's excellent comedic appeal, the soundtrack, The Sounds of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, is not only a phenomenal choice due to being a good song, but also fits the story perfectly. The Graduate is good for anyone who can appreciate a good movie or could use a good laugh. If there's any testament to the quality of this film, it's the quantity of parodies it has. Its wedding scene is one of the more parodied scenes, and for good reason. The Graduate is both genuine and original, with no reason not to watch it.",9,0,0,8 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Uplifting and fun
","The two critical elements of a musical is it's singing and dancing, and Singin' in the Rain does both perfectly. With memorable songs such as 'Good Morning' and 'Fit as a Fiddle' and without a single step out of place, Singin' in the Rain can easily be considered one of the greatest musicals ever. The problem with most musicals is that they can come off too corny, maybe because they try too hard or simply because of bad screen writing. Singin' in the Rain is, admittedly a little corny, but surprisingly engaging. The story, the characters, the song and dance, it all works quite well and leaves the viewers wanting to see what happens next. Singin' in the rain is a delightfully charming film and is good for a couple of laughs every time you watch it.",9,0,1,9 May 2014
Psycho," A Hitchcock Masterpiece
","Psycho is the thriller film to compare all other horror/thrillers. It has literally everything you could possibly look for in a thriller. Suspense, a phenomenal soundtrack, glorious cinematography, shocking twists, it has it all. Each scene in Psycho was created masterfully, from the into graphic to the ending dramatic monologue. To name a few aspects, the cop scene portrayed Hitchcock's fear of cops excellently, the shower scene terrified, and still terrifies it's viewers, and the iconic violins in the musical scores are simply flawless.Psycho is a cinema classic. Anyone who (somehow) hasn't seen Psycho should watch it immediately. Even if you don't enjoy horror films, Psycho is still worth seeing simply because it is a flawless film.",10,2,3,8 May 2014
