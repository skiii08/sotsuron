The Hangover," A slick, empty downer
","I was looking forward to this movie, based on some enthusiastic word of mouth from a couple of acquaintances. As I stared at the screen with my expression becoming blank, then black, and without ever laughing out loud, all I could think of was that some movies make you look differently at the people who recommend them. 'The Hangover' is a base, empty mess, wrapped in some slick packaging and hype.I know the party line, from some, but certainly not other, reviews: the movie is a wild, gross-out fun ride that goes down smooth. Quirky buddies try to reconstruct a wild bachelor party night in Las Vegas after they black out and wake up the next day in their trashed hotel suite, with their friend the groom missing. They are a supposedly likable bunch of a weird-acting stoner slob, a dorky dentist with a domineering, unfaithful long-time girlfriend, an irresponsible, self-centered hunk, and a dour boy scout. In their adventures, they encounter colorful characters, like smart-mouth cops, a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson (magically rich, no longer bankrupt, with some canned eccentricities added).The problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags -- either crude or violent or both -- that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow, phony, and cliché. The missing night reconstructed over the course of the movie, with any remaining graphic details gratuitously laid on thick over the end credits, is strikingly unimaginative. (Drunken time with hookers; the drunk, hen-pecked dork marries a single-mom hooker with a heart of gold and then falls for her for real; the awkward slob as genius at cards; the groom swearing renewed, undying devotion to his fiancé; trashing fancy and cop cars; stuck-up, rich parents of the bride, totally wasting Jeffrey Tambor.) As to the mattress tossed from high up down on top of the hotel statue, it is an embarrassing plot contrivance, conveniently to delay finding the groom, that no one investigates until the last minute the source of the damage (including the police or hotel staff, who would know better than anyone that it was a hotel mattress, that none of the hotel windows open, and that hotel cameras would have picked it all up). The rush back to L.A. and happy endings are pat, forced, and uninteresting.Like a self-indulgent child, the movie wants to have it both ways -- the buddies are supposed to be relatable, down-to-earth guys, yet somehow manage to reserve a $4500/night luxury Vegas 'villa,' come up with fancy clothes at will, and all have hot-looking girlfriends, wives, fiancés, or families. The movie goes for cheap laughs early on by having the slob say he has to stay away by law from schools and parks, yet later treats his carrying around a baby, even making lewd gestures with its hand, as all part of the fun. The same tendency is true of the film's use throughout of what it calls this 'fat man' as a pratfalling, publicly urinating punching bag; turning him into an instant genius at cards; his casual talk about using the drug ecstasy; and the film's use of slurs to describe the dorky dentist. The hunk, portrayed as a jerk and not in the least believable as a 'school teacher,' suddenly becomes a devoted family man at the end, hanging all over his wife and son and later even carrying his sleeping son over his shoulder while he leers at cell phone pictures taken by one of his buddies of nude women they made out with in Vegas, as well as of the dentist's bloody, stupidly smiling face after drunkenly pulling out one of his front teeth that night on a dare. The movie does not even manage to convey any genuine sense of joy to the adventures, even as it seems to glorify them, including lots of senseless destruction (like trashing hotel rooms and cars, someone getting shot, an effeminate, foul-mouthed Asian beating people with a tire-iron, the tooth-pulling, etc.).Add to this these points recently made by a print reviewer about the movie: 'I didn't think 'The Hangover' was all that funny. It was too choppy, too mean-spirited and too much of an ensemble that didn't fit together as well as it should have.' (As to the embarrassingly uncritical pass Roger Ebert gave this movie, like so many others, it only reminds me why I always liked Gene Siskel so much better.) Why sweat any of this? It's about drunken partying, right? Identify with it. Go with the flow. It's not about making sense or taking anything seriously. If that works for you, fine. Maybe this is one of those movies where someone likes almost everything or almost nothing. All a reviewer can do is explain why s/he feels one way or the other. For the reasons discussed, what is bad or weak about the movie so overwhelms anything good about it that the above excuses come across to this reviewer as just a convenient, lame cop-out. A cop-out here for failing to entertain in any meaningful sense of the word and in the process not merely disappointing, but spoiling the time of, plenty of people who were looking forward to a good time at the movies.",2,5,8,16 April 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Plays too fast and loose to amount to much
","Being new to the 'Ocean' movies, I did not know what to expect from Ocean's 13. Given the cast, especially Al Pacino, I was looking forward to it. My enthusiasm drained away pretty quickly. The friend who invited me and who had liked both the Ocean's 11 remake and Ocean's 12, had the same reaction I did -- disappointment with the relative lack of action and of spark to the characters here.Ocean's 13 has a light, glib flow and style to it. It has some pleasant, attractive actors and scenery. Pacino's electronic security system gives the movie some focus and challenge. But its choppy pace and frivolity are disappointing. When a movie, like this one, sets up a series of major and minor 'cons,' it should use subtle, clever strokes and should play fair. This movie plays fast and loose on both scores.Within minutes, Ocean has lined up countless moles in key positions in Pacino's casino. This occurs in flimsy and unbelievable ways, like simply dropping in and making an open-ended promise to a desk clerk that she will be made a manager, slipping a restaurant manager some fast cash, and catching a casino floor manager pawning fancy house silverware. The way Ocean infiltrates a man into the casino as a dealer is played more for laughs than believability, and it is left completely up in the air how later blowing the cover of that same man makes any sense for Ocean's plans. A quick, easy chat with one big-shot is all it takes for Ocean to get carloads of high-rolling 'whale' gamblers to up and leave Pacino's hotel.Very early on, Ocean's team seems to have free run of the casino's security and electronics floor. With ease, they repeatedly tramp back and forth across it, so that, for example, one of his men can relieve a guard at just the right moment. Details about how Ocean plans to fix Pacino's dice, roulette wheels, and slot machines, and use a gigantic drill to mimic an earthquake, are glossed over to the point they come off as amateur science fiction - not to mention 'the Gilroy,' some sort of magical love potion used to reduce the only mildly competent guest character in the film, Pacino's top manager Ellen Barkin, to jello.Particularly poorly handled is the way the team spoils Pacino's attempt to get a five-star rating for his hotel. The movie goes completely over the top in inflicting all manner of extreme, unbelievable, foul treatment on the implausible-acting visiting critic. Not content at depriving Pacino of five stars, the movie pounds the joke into the ground, not stopping even at one star. How, in the midst of all of the luxury and other satisfied hotel guests, are we supposed to think that the critic, or anyone else, would believe such an exaggerated, isolated experience? As if in recognition of the clumsy, near-sadistic, unfunny excess, there is a simple-minded, contrived scene at the end where the beleaguered critic is helped to win big at an airport slot machine.Playing fair not only means that the film cannot lift off completely from reality, but it also means that both the good and bad guys need to be up to the challenge. Here, Pacino does nothing but talk tough. He is given fair notice by Ocean at the start, but does not make a single smart move the entire movie, only mistake after mistake (such as being easily manipulated into allowing Bernie Mac to set up a game on the casino floor and generally allowing Ocean's men to swarm all over his hotel, completely undetected and undeterred). In one token scene, which the script comes right out and tells us is meant to show how savvy Pacino is, he taps into an FBI computer to search for the identity and known associates of a dealer who Ocean planted in the casino. But this incident only makes everyone look bad. It depends on Ocean confusingly blowing the dealer's cover, it nearly destroys Ocean's plans, and the way Ocean and his men get out of it is wildly exaggerated and far too convenient. Also way too easily, Ocean dismisses Pacino's threats at the end, confirming the character's total impotence.Indeed, the few adversities faced by Ocean are trumped-up accidents, either overcome too easily or too implausibly. As a result, there is a near-total lack of suspense and a diminished, anticlimactic sense of accomplishment at the end.The film has an overall slack pace, despite -- or maybe because of -- rapid cutaways between short, thin scenes. At times, it feels like slow-motion, which can be one of director Soderbergh's worst tendencies. This saps not only the drama but also the humor. There are so many characters that few if any have time to shine. As if to make up for this, Damon, Cheadle, and Bernie Mac get strained, far-fetched, show-boating scenes that only fall flat. Andy Garcia seems injected almost as an afterthought.The film evokes some sentimentality about the Elliott Gould character, including a short scene reminiscing about 'the old Las Vegas,' but much about this is superficial and unexplained. His end scenes, in which he shows up at and struts around Pacino's casino in fancy dress with a big cigar sticking out of his mouth, acting triumphant based on absolutely nothing that he himself has done, strike a false and ineffective note.Nothing could be easier with a movie like this than writing a canned, shallow, gushing review that ignores all of the problems, settles for the movie's famous faces and places and glitzy, smooth, and easy feel, and hides behind lazy labels like 'popcorn movie' or 'caper flick.' Of course, these qualities, and the talented people involved, give the movie some entertainment value. But not nearly enough. Any serious review has to come to grips with the failings that make this movie a disappointing missed opportunity even as mildly entertaining fluff.",4,2,5,1 August 2007
Bridesmaids," Likable but too thin and low-key to deliver bigger laughs or a serious point
","When I am in the mood for a fun, screwball comedy, it is nice to find a film by Saturday Night Live cast members. Over the years, I have missed a lot of these movies (all of Belushi, Adam Sandler, and Rob Schneider, much of Will Ferrell and Mike Myers and (fortunately) Bill Murray; plus Baby Mama, MacGruber, and others). And there have been some big disappointments (like Master of Disguise, Stuart Saves His Family). But I still look forward to the ones I am able to get to the theater to see. The latest was Bridesmaids, which generally received good reviews but which left me with mixed feelings. The plot is well summarized by other reviews, so I will not repeat it.There were some funny scenes. Stand-outs include the bridesmaids trying on fancy gowns while being stricken with food poisoning from a diner Wiig took them to; Wiig acting crazy on a plane, or to vent her frustrations at the over-the-top bridal shower, or to get a patrolman's attention. Although crude at times, the movie mainly came across as cute, sweet, and genuine. Overall, the acting was good. Wiig's down-to-earth, slightly cranky policeman boyfriend stole the show. The characters were quirky but had real humanity. Only the narcissistic pig who Wiig spent the night with at the start of the movie was a total loser, and he got some well-deserved comeuppance (but not enough, due to a too low-key Wiig). Otherwise, the movie avoided mean-spirited or over-the-top caricaturing. Even Wiig's nemesis, her childhood friend Maya Rudolph's glitzy, seemingly perfect new friend, ended up being portrayed sympathetically as a decent person. The characters' actions, even when exaggerated for laughs, mostly seemed to flow naturally from who they were presented to be. The movie suggested the larger themes that life is what you make of it and that tomorrow is another day.But the movie fell short. Qualities that made it endearing also held back and sapped its energy. It was too slight and understated, and its storytelling too choppy, slow, and uncertain (as, to some extent, was Wiig's acting; Rudolph was reduced to a totally straight role, with none of her normal spark). The film's scattered attempts to be serious and to send a message (including simply coasting on some easy-listening song lyrics toward the end) felt vague, superficial, and false.For example, at a low point for Wiig, when she is hiding out at her mother's home depressed, a loud, crass bridesmaid who is Rudolph's groom's sister and appears to have no prior relationship and to have spent almost no time with Wiig, suddenly shows up and starts wrestling with her on the couch (to get her to show some spunk, we are told). But this key scene (which also includes the sister trashing the groom to Wiig for no reason and with no explanation) comes out of nowhere. There is no preparation for it in the character of this other bridesmaid or any familiarity or rapport between the two women. It is uncomfortable, drawn-out, and phony. Wiig, again acting far too subdued (as she does too often in the film), does not even seem to get it, or to take it anywhere. To chalk this up to Wiig's character's self esteem problems does not make it interesting or effective. Another example, also a key scene, is when the new friend's plans for a flamboyant, extravagant wedding finally become too much for Rudolph, who goes AWOL, returns to her roots, reconciles with Wiig, and says the whole thing has gotten out of hand and out of sync, financially and otherwise, with her family and friends. Yet, the movie bulled right ahead, as if the scene had never happened, to exactly the overblown wedding that Rudolph supposedly had come to realize was not true to who she is, just to squeeze laughs out of all of the excess and to close on a flashy note.Nor did it help the movie that some of the gags did not flow naturally from the characters and story, but were gratuitous, silly, or pat. A small example was Wiig suddenly becoming childish after a serious scene with the policeman, giggling to him to run the siren, just to provide a light-hearted note to end on. A much worse example was the ill-fitting, baseless, tasteless scene about a sandwich that was tacked on to the end credits when it should have been left on the cutting room floor or for a deleted scenes disk.These problems dragged down a movie that I wanted to like a lot more.",Null,0,2,19 August 2011
Inside Man," A promising but failed movie
","I went into this movie with high expectations. The cast and director had done some outstanding work in the past. The plot sounded interesting, with ample chance for rich story and character elements. I came out more disappointed than in any movie in years. A borrowed 'bank heist' premise and a few gritty, stylized, or eccentric touches and small-scale human-nature observations do not add up to a good movie. This is true no matter how talented, intelligent, and otherwise successful the people involved. I cannot join in a chorus of empty praise for what is so clearly a failed film.The storytelling was slow-paced, uneven, disorganized, and uninspired. Long before the film finally dragged to an end and revealed the secret of the heist, I had stopped caring. When the drawn-out movie was not belaboring dense details that did not add up to anything larger, it was veering into thin, superficial subplots -- ones that were either boring or far-fetched and sensationalistic -- with even more superficial characters, dialogue, and interactions.None of the characters were worth caring about or had any depth. They were mere stick-figure plot devices. I have never seen Denzel Washington look bad until this film, or play a less coherent, less impressive character. Other characters were cardboard villains, perhaps with some shock-value traits pasted on for effect, even down to the gray-haired establishment type who appeared briefly to spew obscenities every other word. Jodie Foster made an interesting ice-cold, high-society 'fixer,' and Clive Owen a smooth, cool, wily robber, but their thin, flat characters were mere injected devices for unbelievable actions and story lines. Despite their talents, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were able to add nothing, with stiff performances in empty roles. An air of pseudo-sophistication threw a wet blanket on all of the performances.As a commentary on society or human nature, the film's observations seem trivial. As a crime drama, the police work could not have been less impressive or the dramatic presentation less suspenseful. The rushed attempt toward the end to tie together plot threads, finally create some dramatic momentum, and belatedly manufacture heroics was confusing, contrived, unrealistic, out-of-place, and ineffective.Quite frankly, the disparate elements of this uneven film did not come together to tell a meaningful or entertaining story on any level. It was a major disappointment. The movie does not deserve all the strained, lame, and sometimes outright embarrassing attempts to portray it as a 'masterpiece' or to make excuses for it.",3,1,5,21 March 2007
Shooter," Interesting set-up, technical skill, weak lead, unable to sustain itself
","This movie is imaginative and touches on some interesting ideas. The film creates a picture of how much power and trust a government can have when there is a terrorist threat and what might happen if a well-connected, corrupt organization exploited them to frame an innocent person for a crime it commits. The brave, serious-minded, determined hero faces the impossible situation of having not only the criminals but the entire weight of law enforcement and the public against him. With some grit and technical skill, the movie shows interesting, smart, tough, resourceful ways in which he might try to survive and strike back, despite the staggering odds.At the same time, the very imaginativeness of the movie made it hard to take seriously. This is why I was not bothered by the political cheap-shots others saw in the film. Consider the context. This is an action movie that fails to develop any serious themes, and if it is even trying to, it fumbles them so incompetently it discredits itself. And it is a shame if the film betrayed the book, but I was not offended because I did not even know there was a book.But, purely on the level of entertainment value, stacking the odds so high against the hero, which creates the interesting set-up, also makes it very hard to explain how such a thing could have happened and how the hero could overcome it. It also raises expectations that the movie cannot or does not deliver on for how it will all be resolved. So the movie presents an interesting, well-executed set-up but lacks the depth or development to the characters and story to pull it off in the end.The criminal organization -- superficially represented by a few colorful, stock characters -- is horribly ill-defined, as is any government role in it. The sometimes sinister-seeming actions or dialogue of FBI higher-ups and the frequent placement of the criminal masterminds in what look like government settings create the misleading impression that the villains are actually part of the FBI or another agency. If the movie is trying to imply that the criminals and the government are one and the same, then that is nothing more than a cheap gimmick because no attempt is made to credibly explain how they could be working together (a lone, grandiosely corrupt U.S. Senator from a relatively uninfluential wilderness state and an ex-Colonel are the only links?). The more details that are given, the more implausible the story becomes. The increasingly ineffective way the criminals behave during the movie takes a toll on the credibility of them having planned so masterful an initial crime.As a result of unexplained motivations and unlikely events, an FBI agent ends up teaming with the hero. But the agent is played as a confusing, unlikeable drudge, right from his very first annoying moments on screen. At times, he acts like an eagle-eye, encyclopedic-brain professional, at others like a dunce. Which is it? How does the hero possibly have the time to whip him into shape as a reliable, lean, mean fighting machine?The hero's ability to find out information and obtain resources while on the run are unbelievable. How, for example, does he know just when to show up in a boat with a high-powered rifle to foil an elaborate attempt to stage the suicide of the FBI agent (who has been investigating on his own and been abducted and beaten senseless by thugs)? The villains are careless in figuring out late the identity of the hero's other, first accomplice. The movie tries to explain this, and it could be excused as making the point that even the most technologically savvy, well-planned operations can still fall victim to simple human error. But less excusable is the failure of the hero (whose mind otherwise seems to work like a steel trap) to realize that his accomplice (who simply returns home after helping him) is in great danger. So at the expense of the hero's character, and of victimizing the accomplice, the movie has the hero do something stupid simply because they need it as a plot gimmick. Despite some attention to detail, the three supposedly climactic end scenes, including a stunt with a rifle to show his innocence in front of no less than the U.S. Attorney General himself, the destruction of critical, hard-won evidence for no good reason, and a crude, unimaginative final shootout scene, are a mess -- choppy, slow-paced, unexplained, implausible, contrived, and falling far short of a meaningful, dramatic resolution.The supporting cast includes actors such as Danny Glover, Ned Beatty, and Michael Sandor, who at least bring some zest to undeveloped material. But Mark Wahlberg is weak as the lead. His portrayal is flat and inarticulate, never more so than with the supposedly pivotal line, 'They killed my dog.' His line about working for but hating the government is supposed to be meaningful but comes across as mere smart-aleck cynicism. He acts grim and close-mouthed but not passionately intense. He is serious but not charismatic. He lacks the confident authority, command, and seasoning that Steven Seagal brought to the Under Siege films. The actor playing Wahlberg's FBI partner seems as unimpressive and out-of-his-depth as his character.So, while the movie has some interesting and entertaining elements, the characters and story skate by too much on the surface and come to too clumsy a conclusion to be satisfying.",6,12,25,20 April 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," An entertaining entry in a very entertaining series
","I am a fan of all of the Die Hard movies, and enjoyed this one, too. No matter how out-sized the stories and spectacular the visual effects, the movies remain grounded in the solid, distinctive John McClane character, so well played by Bruce Willis, and in the concept of a head-on conflict between him and a master criminal with a master plan.In Die Hard 4, the gritty, smart, resourceful attempts to fight back against the technological wizardry and sheer firepower deployed by the villains is authentic, priceless McClane. So is his banter, especially with the kung fu henchwoman. The character of the young computer nerd who is McClane's sidekick in the movie complements McClane's character well, without duplicating him, the problem to some extent with the otherwise interesting Samuel L. Jackson in the third movie. As did its predecessors, the fourth movie attempts to differentiate the various villains. Of course, there is a grand criminal scheme, even if it is more vague and abstract than that in the gritty, detailed third movie.That said, and although I always look forward to the next Die Hard movie, I have not liked the third and fourth Die Hard films as much as the first and second. There was something interesting, intense, and masterful about how the first two resolved a complicated, discrete problem in one rich, unfolding setting, with an urgent, direct personal stake by McClane in the outcome. The third and even more so the fourth are so far-flung and grand-scale that much of the sense of a real one-on-one battle in isolated, close quarters is lost. Something is also lost, in terms of accessibility and impact, when an action movie is as dominated as Die Hard 4 is by computers (and I do not mean computer-generated effects but a plot itself dependent on computers).The lack of familiar supporting characters in the third and fourth films hurt continuity and gave them a colder feel. In Die Hard 4, McClane does not even have around him his NYPD buddies from the third film, though taking him off his home turf does add variety and suspense. Adding the character of the daughter is okay but she is nothing special or familiar.The first and second films used music far better than the other two (who cares if Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is included in the trailer of Die Hard 4 if it or anything comparable is not in the movie itself?). Finally, the main villain was never better than in the first movie, and, although the second was more ordinary and Jeremy Irons was somewhat disappointing in the third, the unseasoned, one-dimensional man in the fourth movie probably ranks last. Still, the Die Hard movies may be the best series of action movies there is.",7,1,3,3 August 2007
