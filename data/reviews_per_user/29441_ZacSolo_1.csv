Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Star Wars Movie
","Ignore the hype.  Ignore the reviews.  Go in expecting a Star Wars movie and you shall be rewarded.  Excellent plot and storyline.  Acting is a bit lax at times.  Special effects do have a few holes if you're paying attention, but those are minor and overall quality surpasses anything seen to date. You know the end result, but you will find some unexpected twists on how things come to be.  If you liked ANH, ESB, & ROJ, you should like this one. If you loved them, you'll probably love this one.  If you hated them, well you'll probably hate this one too.  Whatever the case, you make your choice.",10,0,0,11 June 1999
