The Avengers," Don't make such a fuzz about it
","I mean, this is not a bad movie, but it's definitely not one of the best 250 movies ever made. Let's be realistic, it is not even one of the best superhero movies ever made. People totally overrate it because of the nice visual effects, audio, etc; but the plot is not that good and at one point it even becomes kinda dull. Let's hope more IMDb users realize this so that the rating is lowered a little bit. On the good side, it does have some funny moments and the cast is good, the mood is definitely a light one, you can watch this movie at any occasion and is, as we call it in Mexico, 'palomera' which means you only watch it one time and just to pass the time.",7,1,3,23 August 2014
