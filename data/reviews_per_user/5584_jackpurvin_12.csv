Walk the Line," reese witherspoon was the best
","this was a well prepared well produced docudrama about the life of the great johnny cash. the writers left out the trivial and got to the real meat of the june carter and johnny cash's life and their love. a triumphant country western film, which there are very small amounts of them. reese witherspoon played a great part, and she was great in the picture ,this movie is a ten all around. jerry lee lewis played by wayne payne was magnificent and captures a different era in American music. cannot leave out joqquin phoenix as a great compassionate johnny cash. buy the DVD lots of extras from 20 century fox.. worth seeing reese witherspoons other movies to see how she developed this great talent showcased in this movie.",10,0,0,28 June 2006
Training Day," great action,and great acting by denzel and ethan hawke
","a great story, great screenplay, and denzel washington deserves the academy award he got for this picture. ethan hawke is also great as new rookie narcotics cop under sergeant alonzo harris. both perform life changing acting appearances. great party by gang member smiley played by cliff curtis. this actor is really great, in the role as smiley..he adds color and tremendous ability to the part. the whole picture is a ten and deserves watching. and watch with feeling, you have to get into the whole picture from beginning to end to really enjoy. a real thriller with ebbs and tides of emotional roller-coaster give by outstanding class one performances. puts denzel with denero,pacino, Hoffman and brando.. denzel washington is outstanding and his portrayal is spiritual in nature.",10,1,12,4 July 2004
Rocky V," one of the best rocky films
","i would say rocky one , rocky two, and rocky five, are the best of the rocky movies. this is a pretty good movie to end the series. Rocky trusts morrison takes him into his house,teaches him the boxing business, and is shafted at the end.Happens everyday, and anyone who has really gotten ripped off in life;and we all have, can understand this movie. great street scenes in philadelphia.Stallone very good acting in this film..",Null,5,6,24 May 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," great story with great performances
","great screenplay and story based on the whole in the wall gang. based on true story. paul newman is great and teaming up with robert redford even better. some liberties taken with the whole in the wall gang,due to some better choices for the films ending. the bicycle scene and music involved is priceless and if you love movies and actors like newman and  redford can't be missed. good to rent and see over and over again.love and danger intermixed to bring reality to all the characters.",10,2,5,13 May 2003
Meet the Fockers," dustin Hoffman and ben stiller shine in meet the fockers
","after you have seen meet the parents, this sequel meet the fockers,is a great insight into the gaylord focker family(ben stiller).. seems like a quickly made sequel but of great entertainment value. what is striking is the poor acting and showing by robert dinero,who seems like he signed on for the cash. dustin Hoffman is very entertaining as is barbara streisand,as the quirky overly sexed Jewish focker in laws. the contradiction between the obvious wasp family and the Jewish fockers is a great step forward from the meet the parents confrontation..all and all the movie is very entertaining, but i would expect acting awards, just big paychecks for the actors. a moneymaker and made to be so.",5,0,1,22 February 2005
Caddyshack," funny movie especially if you like dangerfield.
","very funny and entertaining movie if you especially like dangerfield. chevy chase is good as ty webb,but, he is played out as a comedic actor. never really is that funny but, can be entertaining. rodney dangerfield is at his best, so is ted knight as judge smails. bill murray fits right in as kookoo groundskeeper. cindy morgan is very good, but sarah holcomb cannot carry part. all in all funny and entertaining.",7,0,0,13 May 2003
Titanic," great movie a little too long.
","movie was fantastic, sad and moving. about the true story of the white lines titanic. the ship that was unsinkable. kathy bates, and leonardo de caprio were excellent. i didnt go for kate winslet as rose. the love story was cleverly intermingled with the horrific sinking in the north atlantic,which changed shipping passenger line regulations forever. the class struggle was also exposed with the love affair of the two . and the damaging affect love has on your heart. great movie, but, a half an hour too long.",8,0,2,14 May 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," a real bomb with big shot names and bad movie
","s movie that insults the intelligence of most of it's audience. both brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie are beautiful to look at but they cant act, just turning out another box office money maker. afraid to attempt something new this is like a combination formula movie template of total idiocy, what a comic duo. Pitt and Jolie, i would rather watch burns and Allen or stiller and Meara. to combine these two into a team is ridiculous it makes you wonder about the publicity of their private lives cover-up a real film fiasco.. this is a picture you can avoid, paying for and avoid renting.. Pitt did a better job in Thelma and Luise. It a good thing the Beverly hills/ publicity club really stood behind this picture. the action scenes were brimmed with stupid clich√©s, the picture lacked anything redeeming and the fact that its Jolie and Pitt ,the Hollywood critics are afraid to really tell the truth about this picture a real bomb.",1,3,7,2 July 2006
Vanilla Sky," great bizarre entertaining movie.
","i thought this movie was excellent. the scenery was great and the acting was terrific. including star performances from tom cruise, penelope cruise and cameron diaz, who is sexy and very real in this flick. the mixture of the story and characters makes this a movie worth seeing. bizarre story line keeps you guessing and entertained, with tremendous sexual tension between cameron and cruise. and penelope cruise is also overpowering in her role.",10,0,1,12 May 2003
Bruce Almighty," jim carrey, jennifer aniston, and morgan freeman all great.
","morgan freeman plays a great god. jim carrey is fantastic and refreshing as a substitute god..and jennifer aniston is heavenly as his funny earthy girlfriend. like most jennifer aniston pictures, she is great in a substandard script,and story that has some real potential flaws.to the point of why was this picture made. the characters casted were great jennifer aniston and morgan freeman deserve better than this. to put class one actors and actresses in a substandard script and movie that goes nowhere,, is a shame. because jennifer aniston is one picture away from movie stardom.SHE DESERVES BETTER SCRIPTS AND ROLES. i mean some scenes bordered on disgustingly stupid..that diminished the comic effect.",9,0,2,4 July 2004
Bruce Almighty," jennifer adds to a somewhat funny movie..
","talented jennifer aniston should have had a bigger role in this somewhat funny. jim carrey is pretty good, but movie drags along at times. again jennifer aniston's addition adds to a movie that is slightly humorous, and brings a slight chuckle, not hilarious but good to see. aniston deserves larger parts in this type of film.",9,0,1,30 December 2003
Rock Star," Jennifer aniston great, movie boring.
","maybe one has to be a real fan of rock and roll to take this movie. I find mark wahlberg as very talented and extremely versatile to carry part off, but, story is stupid and weak. movie is very boring, i found and again, jennifer aniston shines in a boring,weak, and straight to video movie.Even the scenes showing rock groupies is so played and typical it makes the movie look like a television show brought to the movies, aformula fit movie. But, even in this weak picture, jennifer aniston is sexy,charming, and her performance sustains the picture and provides some redeemable qualities.Jennifer aniston is the only shining star in this movie rock fiasco.",Null,0,2,5 May 2003
