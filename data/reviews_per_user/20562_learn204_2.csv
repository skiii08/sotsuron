The Avengers," Take Nodoz
","Take a dozen writers and a dozen directors. Keep each in the dark. Refuse to allow any of them to talk to one another. Then have an intern collate all the scripts and hand a part of the script to each director. After each director has shot his or her portion, hand those portions to other interns and have them splice it together to make a film and try to convince the public that it is a unified film. It has too many story lines with far too much going on. I was almost cheering for the villains to win as I cared nothing for any of the heroes, and yes, I understand the concept of the flawed Marvel hero. It dragged more than Ru Paul and had more holes than Swiss Cheese. I could almost predict the dialog and the plot turning points. Dull, dull, dull. I'm a fan of all of the characters, and this film destroyed any greatness that they had. It all comes down to a script. It's like building a skyscraper on quicksand.Some of the special effects were cool, but that's not worth the price of admission.",2,15,30,11 June 2013
Puss in Boots," Sleepworthy for Adults; Enjoyable for Kids
","Let's face it. Any nicely animated film will entertain the children and this one does the task. The animation is well done and the voices are also well done. The children will recognize the characters from nursery rhymes--Puss in Boots, Humpty Dumpty, Jack & Jill, The Golden Goose, the Magic Beans/Giant, etc. They will be entertained and probably want to watch it again. It does the trick.Adults have also grown accustomed to seeing animated films that work on two levels since the days of Bugs Bunny. So many of these films have in jokes and double entendres and wonderful cultural references. The plot moves beautifully and the dialog keeps us entertained while we have to watch a children's movie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If I had to rate this solely from an adult's point of view, I'd rate it a 2. It's pretty painful. You can actually predict the dialog. There is little of interest. No bones thrown our way to acknowledge that we have to sit and watch this with the young ones. Well, there's some nice dance moves, but that's about it. So, watch it in the background and have some cards.",5,0,3,11 June 2013
