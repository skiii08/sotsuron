Walk the Line," Drama, Music, Love
","I don't usually watch biographical films but this one about a country music icon, Johnny Cash, is really worth seeing. Walk the Line follows Cash's early life, his ascent to the musical Olympus and relationship with June Carter, his second wife. Although the film is two and a half hours long, I watched it in one breath from the beginning till the end. The reason for that, I think, lies in the fact that in Walk the Line there is everything I need in a movie. First of all, there is drama. The brother's death, the abusive father, drug addiction - although these are sad and unpleasant moments in Johnny's biography, it is they that finally bring him to the place he belongs to and to the person he belongs with. Then there is music. As I listened to the songs performed in this film I forgot about all the dramatic moments, problems and difficulties that Johnny and June faced. I'm not a fan of country music but I couldn't prevent myself from tapping my feet to the music or singing along. I enjoyed it so much! And, of course, there is romance and love. Love that has to overcome many obstacles to finally have the right for a 'happily ever after'. This love story was especially interesting to watch because it was real. The director, the scriptwriters, the costume designers and all the talented people, who went out of their way to tell Johnny and June's story and allow us to become a part of it, deserve high praise and recognition. As for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, I have only one word to say: PERFECT. PERFECT chemistry between the two, PERFECT... I would write acting but they didn't act, they LIVED. For me Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon didn't PORTRAY Johnny and June, they WERE Johnny and June. They felt just like Johnny and June did, they thought just like Johnny and June did, they loved just like Johnny and June did. Outstanding! No more words are needed.So, do I regret watching this film? Not for a second.
Would I recommend it to other people? Absolutely.
Why? Because Walk the Line proves that the best stories, the stories that are worth telling, come from real life.",10,0,0,6 March 2018
