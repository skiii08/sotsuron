Iron Man 3," The problems with Iron Man 3.
",The problems with the movie were: Pepper says she worked with Aldrich years ago but there was no back story. Pepper wears the Iron Man suit in the beginning but doesn't get the suit she wears in the comics at the end. Tony has anxiety problems at the start of the film but just disappears in the middle for no reason. Rhodey says he prefers the War Machine suit to the Iron Patriot suit but doesn't get to be War Machine during the big fight at the end. Tony doesn't take Extremis so he doesn't get his powers to control machines. The Mandarin was not the incredible character he is in the comic with his magic rings. Instead he was a front that Killian used to steer the public eye away from him. Shane Black completely destroyed Iron Man's arch enemy. The Mandarin is to 'Iron man 3' as Deadpool is to X-men Origins. Despite the movie being called 'Iron Man 3' it was Pepper who beat the main villain. Tony mainly sent the suit into battle whilst he controlled it from a safe distant which is the same as a character going through an incredible adventure then we find out it was all a dream. After the final battle Tony sets all his suits to self destruct just to make a few fireworks. The film was supposed to be about Tony surviving on his own devices yet he gets help from a small boy. Tony makes the suit fly onto Pepper at the beginning of the film but says to Rhodey during the big fight that he can't put a suit on him because their only tailored for Tony. At the end of the film Tony has his Arc Reactor and the Shrapnel removed from his heart and then throws his Arc Reactor away after saying in 'The Avengers' 'It's a part of me now'. Tony doesn't get a main suit for the end fight he just jumps around in the ones he summons to him.Shane Black has truly ruined what could've been the greatest saga ever made.,3,1,3,10 May 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Review of 'Silver Linings Playbook'.
","When I saw 'Silver Linings Playbook' I thought great films like this make up for all the bad films ever made. I was amazed by the talent that the actors/actresses had shown in this film by bringing these characters alive. Jennifer Lawrence in particular showed incredible acting ability revealing the psychology of a grieving young widow who doesn't take the loss off her husband well. One scene is extremely insightful and that is where Jennifer Lawrence is in a diner with Bradley Cooper and she suddenly pretends to act completely crazy to spite Bradley, This is definitely Jennifer Lawrence at her best. As for the main character Bradley Cooper made his character special by illustrating his flaws so perfectly and thinking that he doesn't need to take his therapist's advice or take his medication. And finally Bradley and Jennifer's dance routine at the end was incredible, their routine perfectly portrayed the characters mood swings and wasn't unrealistic as they ruined their big finish. In conclusion I would recommend everyone to see this film.",10,3,5,1 March 2013
