Requiem for a Dream," Could scare anyone Sober...
","My brother recommended this movie to me, and one day as I was buying Traffic, I realized I had some extra cash and decided to take the risk of buying a movie I'd never seen.It was like putting down a million dollars on black 28 playing roulette and the ball actually landing on black 28.  I saw 'Pi' when I was less mature and not as into movies, so I didn't really have a great expectations of Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream,' but as I started watching, I realized that what I was getting was amazing.'Requiem' is one of those movies where you actually start to feel the characters.  I actually began to feel the pain that Harry (Jared Leto) experienced in this movie.  The film was exhausting to watch, but it was a good exhausting. Something that you look forward to when you're seeing a movie for the first time.Lately, as we've come into the age of movies that are set out to just entertain, and not set out to express someone's art, I've become a little disillusioned at film.  There are certainly films that are great, wonderful even, but it's not often that you get a film that means something.  A film that makes you think about it, and makes you think about your own life. This movie achieves that and then some.  See Requiem for a Dream right away, but make sure that you're in the mood to watch a movie that you could scare you by using reality.  You must not go into this movie with the idea that you're seeing a movie like 'Blow' where the ups and downs of drugs are pure entertainment.Watch this movie, and think.",Null,0,0,1 June 2001
