The Ring," Ring a waste of money
",If you want to see a not scary movie with a jumbled plot go see the ring. The movie was a big disappointment. I thought by the end of the movie they would atleast tie the plot that made no sense up. Instead they just made it even more confusing. From what it looks they are going to try to make a sequel to the movie. if i had it over i wouldnt have wasted my money to see the first one. No matter how many times you watch the movie you wont ever figure it out. Movies are fine that leave it open for you to make up the connections or to figure out but good luck on this one. No one can explain this one. This movie should be classified as weird and freaky. I dont reccomend it if you haven't figured it out.,2,0,0,9 November 2002
