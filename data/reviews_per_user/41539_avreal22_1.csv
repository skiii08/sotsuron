50 First Dates," Concept seems stolen.
","I actually paused a movie to write this. What movie you ask? Good Bye, Lenin. Which, ironically enough, was a recommendation from this website.I can't help but think of the fragile concept of someone in each movie (female) has to have the truth of the future hidden from them. Good Bye, Lenin came out in 2003 and 50 first dates came out in 2004.Granted Good Bye, Lenin is more creative and interesting then watching Adam Sandler act like a complete loser. And even though it is in a different language, it is far more understandable than why anyone would watch 50 first dates to begin with.You're probably asking why I watched [50 first dates] it. I ask myself that about a lot of movies I watch. But if I had never watched it, well then I guess I would have never thought the concept was stolen.",Null,0,0,20 September 2004
