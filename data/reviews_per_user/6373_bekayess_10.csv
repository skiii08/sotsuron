Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Seems like a remake. . .
",". . .of the original.  Nothing new story-wise, but more special effects, more strange beings, more unusual languages.  An oversized video game, if you ask me, without the interaction of the player (aka, audience).  Give the the original on DVD and I'll be in happy.  ;(",Null,0,1,19 January 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The 'Wizard of Oz' of my generation
","Too bad a few of you have given this film a 'sickly sweet' review.  E.T. is a classic, the 'Wizard of Oz of my generation.  Maybe it is a bit 'sentimental,' but there's nothing wrong with that.  Here are a few more 'sentimental' films which have (or should) become popular classics:  'Mary Poppins;'  'Peter Pan' (the Mary Martin TV version);  'The World of Henry Orient;  'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'   Even the original 'Planet of the Apes' has moments of sentimentality.  To quote a certain LITTLE MISS SHOWBIZ:  'Don't be a Grumpy Wumpy.'  In my own words: you sad, cynical SOBs should look inside and find the inner child--and the inner E.T.  What a better place this world would be if we could all be more happy and positive-and 'sentimental.'",Null,0,1,26 October 2002
Brokeback Mountain," Get over your bigotry of gays
","The homophobes and bible-thumpers who have trashed this film should just get over themselves and keep their bigoted opinions private. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a beautiful film of unrequited love in another era--an era that was caused by those same bigoted homophobes and bible-thumpers who are portrayed in another great film, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK. Bravos to the cast and director of BROKEBACK. And to those of you who are so prejudiced against gays, please take a really hard look at your own life--maybe you're a gay person like Ennis, whose parents--or religion--taught you all the awful beliefs that you'll be teaching your own children.",Null,12,45,12 April 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Okay film, but why the 'R' rating?
","Waiting for the film to begin and suffering through the interminable previews of coming attractions, I was joined in my row my three young men easily in their early teens (one may have also been only 11 or 12).  I wondered why and how they got into this R-rated film since theaters are supposed to be checking IDs and keeping those under 17 out of R films. Based on what I had heard about the film, I made a judgement that these kids probably shouldn't see it--but I chose not to exercise my civic duty and report them to the management for their having sneaked in (as I heard them discussing a few minutes later).  During and after the film, though, I questioned the wisdom of the MPAA rating on this film.  I would have given it a PG-13 at most.  *SPOILERS AHEAD--BUT ONLY IF YOU'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT THE FILM*The beheadings were frequent, but not particularly gory, nor was the body that was cut in half (had I not known about this scene from reading 'Cinefantastique,' I don't know it I would have picked up what was happening--the scene was so dark, and this was not as graphic as it could have been.)  Also, the spearing scene in the church has been done before in PG movies.  Maybe it's the over-sensitiveness of the times, but this is definitely a PG-13 film.  In fact, the historical references and use of language might interest our youth in history.  (By the way, there wasn't a profanity to be heard, that I recall, and no sexual situation beyond what is found on daytime soap operas.)  [For what it's worth, I'm not some kid complaining about the rating, but a 42-year-old man with a little more faith in the ability of our youth to distinguish between fantasy horror and violence and real world violence than the people who rated this film.]",7,0,0,27 November 1999
Judgment at Nuremberg," Compare the Germany of this film to the USA of today. . .
",". . .and can anyone truly doubt that there are powers in our country today who would try to destroy, through hate, fear and religious righteousness, many of their fellow Americans simply because we don't believe in their god and bible and president? Hitler destroyed jews, gypsies and homosexuals; these so-called christians in America who supported George W. Bush would like to do the same. Maybe some of those folks who compared 'King George' to Hitler weren't too far off the mark. Just watch and listen to this film and the similarities will become painfully obvious. I only hope my fellow Americans will wake and take action against 'W' and his administration in 2008--and please let's hope he doesn't do anything worse than he has already done to harm this great nation.",Null,7,13,25 November 2004
28 Days Later...," What a piece of sh...I mean, crap!!
","And I'm being polite, here. . .I've much stronger words to use for this awful mess of a film.  The hype was so great when it came into theaters, and I am SOOOO glad I chose to stay away. . . and wait until it was on video. But I was a sap to buy it on DVD.The premise has been done before--so much better in so many movies.All I can say is. . .eBay!  Item for Sale.  (I'm sure there's another sucker out there willing to buy it from me.)",Null,2,3,23 February 2004
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Good film, but. . .
",". . .not revolutionary as far as 'rock' musicals go.Among other films featuring rock music (rather than the traditional broadway style music) that have broken ground are:1.  PRISCILLA. . . 2.  HEAD 3.  J.C. SUPERSTAR and even 4.  Bye-Bye Birdie.I think this is a wonderful film, and one I thoroughly enjoy, but it's not earth-shattering or anything like that.  It's a movie that adds to the previous rock musicals of this genre.John Cameron Mitchell is EXCELLENT, though.",10,0,2,18 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," Effects: 10; Story: 0
","This follow-up to THE MUMMY (AKA, 'Quasi-Indiana Jones in the Land of Im-Ho-Tep') has great effects, but a plot/story that could have been told in about thirty minutes.  Not one of the better sequels. . .let's hope Universal puts this series to bed before we get 'The New, Computer-Generated Abbott and Costello Meet The Mummy and All His Comic Foes.'",Null,0,0,3 October 2001
Carrie," A Classic
","'Carrie' is a modern classic--okay, so it's 30 years old--and many recent horror films could take a few lessons from the story, style and substance of this wonderful adaptation of the Stephen King novel. The actors are all excellent, and the effects--pre-CGI--hold up today. Yes, there are deaths, but it is not about a bunch of teens who are picked off by some silly villain in a hockey mask, or with razors for fingers, or even Michael Myers in his mask. Every character has a believable motivation for his/her actions, given each character's background, history and involvement with Carrie. And again, the actors all give stunning, believable performances. 'Carrie' is a masterpiece of horror films. And Carrie herself, the victim, is totally believable - and we empathize with her.",10,2,3,23 May 2006
The Wizard of Oz," The best fantasy ever made
","I remember watching OZ on television at my great-grandmother's home in the very early 60s--maybe 62 or 63 (I was only 5 years old).  Grandma had the only color TV in our family, so my Mom and Dad brought us kids to her house to watch it.  Grandma (who was 43 when OZ premiered in '39) loved the film and wanted to share it with all her 'children.'  Anyway, I've just bought my third VHS copy of the film--the most recent release.  I'm so thrilled with how clear and clean the picture is--the sound, despite being touted as being 'digitally remastered. . .in true stereo, is okay, but not as good as the picture.  It's a true classic--and as I type this I realize that I am the same age now as my great-grandmother was when OZ was first released.  Our grand-parents always know what's best for us, don't they?  THE WIZARD OF OZ rules!!!",10,1,3,27 December 1999
