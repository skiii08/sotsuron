Casablanca," Chemistry at it's best.
","This film might have the best on screen chemistry in movie history.  Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart make you feel like they really are Rick and Ilsa.  From they way they look at each other to the way they talk to each other both men and women alike will fall in love with this film.I hope they never try to make a re-make of this film.  I don't think that anybody can duplicate the way Bogart and Bergman make you laugh, cry, and feel good about the world.Whether you are old or young, man or woman, with somebody or single, this film will make you believe in the goodness of the human spirit.",10,0,1,21 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Far ahead of it's time!
","When you think of movies that transcended time you think of 'Guess who's Coming To Dinner', or '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  Star Wars fits this bill to a T.  Nothing like Star Wars, with the exception of maybe '2001: A Space Odyssey', had ever been seen up to that point.  This movie has influenced more pop culture then any movie up to that time (with the possible exception of 'Planet of the Apes').  To have any movie influence a new set of movies (or prequels), is unheard of in movie making.  It really says something to see Star Wars more popular now then when it was at it's height in the late seventies and early eighties.An age-old, myth-like story, in a setting that had never really been explored in movie making.  If you are impressed with the space movies of today, see the one that started the space movie genre.Plus this gave Harrison Ford (Han Solo), his first real big break. What move needs to be said?  If this isn't a classic tell me what is!",10,0,0,22 October 2001
