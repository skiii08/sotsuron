The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Brilliant in nearly all ways
","To set the scene I try my very best not to watch trailers or see any spoilers to films so I can always review with my own eyes and mind. Today I have walked into 'Perks of Being a Wallflower' with no preconceptions or favouritism.Verdict: The film is brilliant in nearly all ways. It's fun but not, it's happy and sad, it's got a simple story but it's deep. The film is class.Directing wise, it was well shot and the film built brilliantly. The were scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of the city (I don't know where) which made me want to hop on a plane, and I have just heard he wrote the book which makes me feel he was the only guy with the vision to truly make this film come alive. Director (I am sure you would never read this) - Please do this again.Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller ..well everyone. I think the casting choices were spot on – give the team a cigar, the casting was nearly faultless.Just one other final point Paul Rudd plays a great inspiring English teacher – which I don't know if it was just me but the lack of true communication between the Charlie really worked – it gave the edge this film more into the world of Dead Poets Society than say something like .... well I don't want to say.Boomskanka – Respect Paid to everyone involved. It's an ace film.Also for anyone younger than me wondering what the song was after watching the film – it was Lord David Bowie - Heroes",9,1,2,11 October 2012
Legend," It's not a classic but ...
","First some facts about the film (not these are not spoilers) Facts 1 : Tom Hardy's performances as Ronnie and Reggie Kray are amazing. His acting, coupled with clever effects meant that within minutes you completely forget that these two characters are played by the same man. My partner thought that both Tom Hardys were very handsome – so I am presuming this will give the film a couple extra stars for the ladies.Fact 2: The film should have been advertised as The Reggie and Frances story. This film centres on Reggie and Frances' marriage and is told by Frances. However, it fails to grip you into this turn of events. Frances is not overly likable as a character and the film fails to show the thrills that must have made someone fall in love someone such a Reggie Kray and while it shows the lows it doesn't overly play them. Yet the majority of the two hours was spent developing/reviewing this love story, it had the potential to go further but didn't live up to it.So what about the film – is it any good? It was shot well, it had a feel of an Instagram account to it, which gave a sense of ease and comfort to watching.My main complaint is the structure and tempo of the film. The Kray's have so much background material. If I were the director I would have built a trilogy for this story, there's a good cast coupled with a rather British fascination of the Krays which could have been developed well over time. Brian Helgeland's focus on the Frances and Reggie story seems to have missed an opportunity. The bad bits weren't bad enough, the glory bits weren't glorifying enough and the black parts were beyond obvious. The Krays have become a Legend over time, I am not saying that they are people who should be admired but they have none the less gone down in our history, this could and should have been utilised better.The focus on Frances means that the violent and dark parts of the East End in the 60s don't come across. The voice-over by Frances could have been brilliant at implementing this but it barely scratched the surface.The disappointing thing is that this isn't a bad film, it is actually quite good. It isn't boring, but it gives you a sense that it is growing into something that basically never appears - a climax than never happens.It's not a classic, it's too long yet too short at the same time but it is worth a watch.",6,0,1,12 October 2015
Life Is Beautiful," Life Is Beautiful - years on still class.
","I recently noticed that I have scored a lot of films extremely high (on IMDb). The first time I had watched these films was many years ago. I thought out of respect to them films I should put finger to keyboard and comment.My comments are: Firstly if you watch this film and it's not a movie that will have a lasting effect on you, then maybe film is not your medium. I suggest this could be the most perfect balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama ever made in film.Secondly can any three words highlight a films content so strangely, Life if beautiful? The focus given to the strength of human nature in adversity but somehow delicately handling the Holocausts content.Thirdly, the film could stand alone on the acting. Roberto Benigni incredible, the doctor who loved puzzles, the wife's portrayal of pure good nature – they could have all won awards.Laugh and cry in the same moments is something that special – this film did it. As a farther in times of stress and panic - Guido is still a role model in the back of my mind years on. LIB Respect Paid.",10,2,3,7 December 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Make a film not the book.
","The opening of the film is positive – I felt it had a strong definition and a good tempo. The early stages of the movie did a good job building motives and some of the confusion in the character development really did help build the plot. The film got to a critical point where something great could have been unleashed. Then just when you thought it was about to get good, that something was really going to kick in it didn't. Firstly, the introduction of the other districts characters seemed rushed. Secondly, the fight scenes totalled a couple of minutes, the biggest fight scene with some monkeys (I know baboons) was poorly lit. I enjoyed the concept of Amanda Plummer's character discovering the time zones but this was never developed in the plot (I think the director just wanted her to act a little Pulp Fiction). I did think Jeffrey Wright's character was interesting and needs a little spin off series- how to kill people by science. However, the ending was lazy - the cliff hangers only purpose was to sell the next film in the series. I actually got to the point during the tournament where there were a few little yawns – did anyone actually care when someone died? I wasn't even sad when the nice old bird got cannoned by the gas. In summary – the film starts with good tempo then moves into scenes which are disjointed and unorganised, most running at double speed during important moments. The film could be just so much better if Francis Lawrence had made a film and not tried to make the book.Note, I do still recommend watching the film as its entertaining – and no disrespect to the book is intended in this review.",7,2,17,27 November 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Mythology Continued
","I felt the brilliance of the first film was found in the under lying mythology of the Continental Hotel, the coins, the laws/culture between the Reeves and some of the smaller parts (police official / bartender etc). As such I hoped that in the second film this would be continued; I wasn't disappointed.The film continues from the first film with a great level of balance. Respecting the first film and allowing a 2-hour film to have its own identity without dragging was a challenge that was met well. The Laurence Fishburne element and the subsequent ending allow a great opening for another film.Another strength of the movie is that the John Wicks character (like Neo i) is so well suited to Keanu Reeves. He is the strong-silent type and it feels Chad Stahelski, the Director, glorifies this and uses it to move the story forward. He gives you the same in an enhanced but similar format.Loved : Lance Reddick as the Hotel Manager / Ruby Rose and the signing stuff Note: If you don't like people being shot in films – this is not the film for you!",8,17,28,14 February 2017
