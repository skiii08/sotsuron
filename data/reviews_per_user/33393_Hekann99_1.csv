Requiem for a Dream," A great and terrible view on addiction
","This movie had me shivering!Aronofsky shows with terrible intensity and with a sense of unstoppable momentum how a group of people, through their various addictions are thrown closer and closer to the gaping maw of the abyss. After I'd watched this movie, I felt if I had stood in front of a locomotive. I enjoyed the film PI, and Requiem had the same intense, almost suffocatingly claustrophobic sense to it.",10,0,1,18 January 2004
