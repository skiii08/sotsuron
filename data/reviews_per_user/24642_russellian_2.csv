It," People on this site are missing the point
","The reason there is such childish humor is because the characters( spoiler alert) are kids!! They say stupid stuff and make bad jokes. That's to flesh out the characters. These are hormone filled, dirty teenagers who want to say bad words and make mom jokes. This movie was beyond my expectations. I think this movie is great. People who give it a 1 Star obviously don't understand.",8,1,3,1 June 2018
Watchmen," A good looking and Cerebral experience with mind numbing action but some clunky acting
","The effects in this film really went it its favor. The characters that had some of the least backstory were eventually the best developed, such as Rorschach and The Comedian. Dr. Manhattan's effects and Billy Crudup's port rail is spot on to what Id think Manhattan shouldn sound like. Where the movie falls is in it's Female lead. She was one of the most developed in the comic but she comes of as cold and whiny. Malin Ackerman has the most shoddy line delivery in the movie, right next to Matthew Goode, that may be because he had to do an American accent with his very British one. Ultimately the movie comes down to a solid 90% for me.",9,0,0,27 May 2018
