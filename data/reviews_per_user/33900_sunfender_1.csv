Skyfall," conspiracy theory
","I think all those reviewers who gave the movie a 10, and a WOW, were paid. This is getting ridiculous. Organizing paid reviewers is probably where the budget for plot-writing went. As pointed out by so many genuine reviewers, the movie plot contains so many holes that it has nothing to get the audience excited about. Right from the beginning, when Bond and the bad guy were on top of the train, and Bond climbed into the earth-mover, the bad guy just stood there shooting at the machine, when he could have gone inside the train and taken someone hostage or tried to escape by parachuting like other movie spies do. And what about the shot by the MI6 sniper at Bond, she only had one bullet? after shooting Bond all she could do was stare at the villain? the call made by M was of course totally idiotic. there was equal chance of Bond winning the fight and the bad guy getting shot. The emotional burden of shooting your own agent would surely tip the scale towards letting Bond fight it.There were many more bad plots, like the whole thing in the casino. why the casino bouncers wanted to kill him, and why inside the casino when they try to run a business? these kinds of plots would of course be forgiven if there were other attractions, such as good special effects (none) or action sequence (not so great). I understand the plot with the exotic girl was just an excuse to put a shower scene in the movie, so I can overlook the otherwise lack of reason for that subplot, but the worst plot was the bad guy getting himself captured and jailed in MI6. The reason for doing so? so that he could shoot into a committee room in Westminister, when the scheduling of which would surely be a piece of cake for a genius like him to find out in advance. Oh, but he wanted to look her in the eyes in MI6 jail to tell her how much he hated her. My bad.",1,14,26,22 January 2013
