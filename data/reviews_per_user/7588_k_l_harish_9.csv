Blade Runner 2049," Sloth Runner 2049
","Went to BR 2049 after critics put the movie on the throne of greatness in film making. But, after nearly 3hrs I felt this movie should have been named as 'Sloth Runner 2049'. Actually even sloths will yawn to this abomination. The acting was one of the most expression less I have ever seen and can't believe the high ratings. But the box office did justice though. This movie is not art, it looks like a kid randomly painting few orange and pink hues that too being blindfolded and left the viewers to watch it dry. Save your time.",1,6,10,7 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Worst Avengers Film. Infinity War was 14 million Times Better!
","Well, was hyped to the max for this movie but in the end, Avengers Endgame was as bad as its name and was the worst Avengers movie. Story was disconnected and dialogues were cliche. Thanos and Avengers doing hand to hand combat was beyond ridiculous.Utmost focus on Cap and Iron Man. Unimaginable nerfing of Thanos, Thor and Hulk. Time travel was handled extremely badly. Humor was overused and movie felt like Gotg-3. Power of Avengers and Thanos was not visualized properly and battle/fight scenes felt bland. I need to re-watch Infinity War to forget this abomination.",1,185,345,2 May 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Good Movie. Critics are too harsh on this.
","I always loved x-men idea and powers. So was excited for this one. Did enjoy the 3 trailers (Except for the wolverine spoiler). Before watching the movie I did read the critic reviews and was thinking how bad the movie must be to get such a low rating.Anyway, enter IMAX, and movie begins: First part where Apocalypse being buried and power transfer was really good (Background music was nice here). His awakening was also kind of good but not as great as the previous scene.Magneto in Poland as a steel worker felt little meh. But the scene where his wife and daughter gets killed and he holding them was very emotional. Fassbender acting was great here.Apocalypse recruiting horsemen felt little rushed without any depth. Angel getting metal wings was badass. Apocalypse disarming the world from nukes was neat.Oscac issac/Apocalypse felt badass but script around his powers and intentions was very bad which makes us less attached. James mcavoy/professor was damn good as usual. JL/Mystique felt lame. Nightcrawler had his moments. Quicksilver was an extended version of DOFP which was cool. Cyclops/Havock were okay. Olivia munn had few good moments but overall was underused. I felt jean to be okaish tough I enjoyed the phoenix form.Wolverine cameo was pretty good but involves gore. Climax felt underwhelming considering the scale of destruction Apocalypse wanted to unleash. There was no explanation why apocalypse just disarms quicksilver/Cyclops when he could have killed them with a wave of his hand.Magneto switching sides in the middle of world destruction based on few emotional words from mystique felt lame.Overall its a good movie don't believe the critics. It has nice wow moments. It does have bad stuffs but it's worth a watch in theatre.",8,12,23,27 May 2016
Avatar," James Cameron Matches God in Creativity and Imagination!!!
","I watched the trailer of 'Avatar' just a week before and i was impressed but when i saw the movie in IMAX-3D...I was Speechless...i wish the movie had never ended...till yesterday 'LOTR' and 'King Kong(2005)' - both by 'Peter Jackson' and his own 'WETA' were my best Special Effects Movies...but from today its 'Avatar'...'James Cameron' proved that he is one of the top 3 filmmakers of Hollywood along with 'Peter Jackson' and 'Spielberg'...Watch Avatar not just because reviews are good, not just because it is directed by James Cameron, not just because it has amazing special effects, not just because its one of the most expensive movies.....Watch 'AVATAR' because It's an Out Of The World Experience!!!...and Please if possible, watch it in IMAX-3D if you want to have the complete experience and to give justice to the Special Effects...'Avatar' makes me feel Why Earth is so Dull????!!!!'James Cameron', you Matched God in Creativity and Imagination!!!",10,5,11,19 December 2009
Sicario," Incredibly Directed movie
","Sicario is a kind of movie that pull you into it by the pure brilliance of Acting, Direction, Cinematography and Sound. Story Is decent but other elements is top notch and you will be hooked till the end. Del Toro is incredible as emotionless hitman. A scene near the end which shows his Ruthlessness is unique.",10,0,0,5 October 2018
Joker," Incredible Acting, Screenplay and Cinematography!
","Joaquin Phoenix take a bow. Astonishing for him to match Heath Ledger as Joker.On the actual movie - Screenplay, Cinematography and Bgm are incredible. But the extremely depressing tone of the movie was a little off for 'my taste'.",8,3,5,14 January 2020
Inception," Nolan's Imagination defies both Reality and Dream!
","Inception is the Best movie i have seen till date. It pushed LOTR trilogy to 2nd place in my Top movies list. After seeing the movie, more than anything else, i was amazed by the incredible imagination and direction of Nolan.This is without doubt the most complex script i have ever seen. In-spite of its complexity, Nolan has directed and presented so brilliantly that it is understandable to the viewers.In short, after July-16, Nolan has set a benchmark in imagination and direction through 'Inception' in world cinema. Watch it to believe it and to go into the Dreamworld of Nolan!",10,2,5,26 July 2010
Black Panther," Black Void
","This movie was over much hyped by critics due to reasons nothing to do with the actual film. This film is a trash. Story which is cheesy, cliche dialogues, poor casting and bland acting makes this movie an abomination. There is no panther in this but just a Black Void.",1,0,3,7 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Forget Nostalgia - This is one of the worst movie of the year
","Went to see this movie with lots of hype, but wow can't believe it was so bad and on top of it can't believe the high rating. Acting was bad with none of the actors look involved, setting was bad with the same old Death star stuff droid having the clue, Pacing was very slow as there was no surprises with lame dialogues and silly comedy in between and during climax we were forced to watch for 5mins the expected to occur - ren kill han, CGI and action were ordinary compared to current trend of action movies and script was the worst and its better to not talk about it. Finally JJA, please leave star wars. I feel that the main reason for such a high rating is just nostalgia of hardcore fans. Nostalgia is good but they can't make a movie just for that sake. Keep nostalgia aside and watch,it is a pure bad movie. I am done with Star wars. This is by far my worst movie of the year.",1,76,123,25 December 2015
