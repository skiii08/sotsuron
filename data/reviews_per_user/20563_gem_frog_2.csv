Blade Runner 2049," Doesn't hold a candle to the original.
","The original Bladerunner was a sci-fi noir classic, it had a mysterious and magical aura about it. Everything from the plot, sets, the classic Vangelis score and the meticulous level of detail was just sublime. This *cough* sequel *cough* is not even in the same ball park stylistically, story wise or in any other way. It felt cold and lacked the originals ambiance and magical tone,moved like molasses and the overly convoluted and sleep inducing story made me stare at the walls and other patrons to see if they were still awake. Hollywood has lost the plot literally and figuratively and it just goes to show that bigger budgets and fancier CGI do not make a superior film.They just don't make em' like they used to.",3,57,120,5 October 2017
Interstellar," Why oh why did I not listen to reason?
","Was almost not going to give this movie a pass, having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess.And oh my what a bloated, drawn out, rudderless and boring bloated mess it was!I have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted, it was that bad.The story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and clich√© dross thrown in for good measure.It didn't feel like a sci-fi, more like a soppy drama with a few sci-fi elements thrown in and the special FX where nothing special, a few OK scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland.I thought it was going to be an innovative, trippy Kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes, aliens, strange technologies, Otherwordly Gods!Instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members.
