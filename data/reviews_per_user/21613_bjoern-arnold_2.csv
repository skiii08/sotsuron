Catch Me If You Can," A different Walken
","I don't want to comment much on the film which I liked. It is a very light drama/comedy that is fun for the moment. But nothing more than that. I think diCaprio gives a satisfying performance-the best his limited range allows. He's very charming and likeable. Hanks on the other hand, who even would get an Oscar nod for playing a dead body, is wasted. I have never been a fan of his acting (highly overrated) even though he had great movies (since he can choose from the best material, it's no wonder). The one who shines here is Christopher Walken, with the only touching performance in the entire movie. He provided the needed depth and delivered a character description nobody thought he would be able to do (after all his maniacs-roles). His Oscar-nomination in the supporting category is well deserved. I hope he will win after Ray Liotta ('Narc') and Dennis Quaid ('Far from heaven') got neglected by the academy. Anyway, go see the movie. It's a pleasant opportunity to kill 2 1/2 hours.",7,0,1,12 February 2003
Mystic River," Great drama, great cast!
","I got to see this atmospheric and dark drama at a test screening in Hamburg. It must have been the final cut since it had already been showing at the Cannes festival. What can I say: it is Eastwood's best movie since The Unforgiven! A great script by Brian Helgeland, an outstanding ensemble cast and a magnificent direction is combined into a complex and interesting tale that will keep you guessing until the end. I won't give away anything about the plot nor any spoilers. But it is a story with characters that you care for right away.The acting is superb! But that was no surprise. Especially Kevin Bacon gives a tremendous performance as a cop. It's another memorable role in his impressive career that should get the recognition this gifted actor deserves. Tim Robbins is superb as well as a man haunted by terrible memories he experienced as a child. All I can say: go see this movie, even though it's fairly slowly paced. It is a pleasure to see that classical story telling has not died yet. The film is definatley a candidate for Best Movie at the Academy's in 2004.",10,5,9,1 July 2003
