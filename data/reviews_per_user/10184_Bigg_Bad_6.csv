Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Terrible and disappointing
","I was actually looking forward to this film after having read and enjoyed the book, However what I was expecting and what I got were two completely different things. The movie has practically nothing to do with the novel, the stories are very different and not for the better. The movie constantly jumps many years ahead, leaving important questions unanswered, it's as though the producers knew the movie was terrible and just wanted it over with as soon as possible. As I said this leaves many questions unanswered, you are never given any real reason for the different characters motivations besides some very shallow reasons. You never really care about the characters because the movie does not spend any time developing them. And even the main character mr. Lincoln himself is not given much motivation for going in to the vampire hunting trade, nor for becoming a lawyer, politician or president. What the novel did so well making all the characters so human and making you feel that all the sacrifices that Abraham makes through his long and lonely life, are worth it in the end. Instead we get a shallow and stupid movie that has nothing to do with the book and trades a great story for ridiculous action and a super hero like Abraham Lincoln.Take my advise, don't ever waste your time watching this piece of garbage, but pick up the book instead because that one is actually good.Just a final note, no I would not have liked the movie any more if I had not read the book first, but I probably would have never read the book afterwards, which would have been a shame.",3,2,5,13 October 2012
Captain Marvel," A watchable movie that could have been great
","Maybe Brie Larson really is the world class actress people keep saying she is, but she sure does not show it in this movie.The movie has an interesting story at its core, but it just fails to deliver on it due to the wooden performance by Brie and the often hollow execution.The biggest problem is that the movie tries to make Captain Marvel a feminist icon instead of just an incredible character that men and women alike can look up to. She has no personality to speak of, no flaws of weaknesses you can relate to like all the other great Marvel characters. The feminism propaganda is so heavy handed it often feels like it is literally being shoved down the audiences throats and it really takes you out of the movie. Sam jackson plays his part well, but it feels like he is playing a completely different character. Sam Mendelson, Anette Bening and Jude Law for the most part do a great job.The makers of the movie are also pushing Captain Marvel as the 'end all, be all' of the MCU that it is devaluating all the other characters. A couple of scenes really screw up what was built up in previous movies.I makes me sad that this movie could have been so much more, but ended up mostely being a forced political statement that hurts female leads more than it helps.Here's hoping Scarlet will set things right with the Black Widdow movie and that Hollywood realizes that great female leads comes from great acting and a good story, not by trying to force a message",3,1,4,9 March 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," 1 step forward, 5 steps backwards
","I am a big Spider-man fan, but never really felt like any of the movies really hit the mark, but Spider-man 2 came closest.I'm really disappointed with The Amazing Spider-man 2, most of all because it had so many good things going for it, but ultimately ends up feeling like a bad movie because for every good thing, there are 5 bad things.First the good: Most of the casting choices are very good, especially for Peter, Gwen and Harry. The costume looks awesome (most of the time, some times it's waaay to shiny) The relationships between Peter and Gwen and also between Peter and Harry, feel real. Interesting visual palet. The Gwen climax is pretty good.The Bad: The Max character is just plain stupid, and feels like something straight out of Batman and Robin. The Electro character lacks any real personality or motivation. The Rhino character is perhaps even more stupid than the Max character. Both before and after becoming Rhino. The romance between Peter and Gwen can be a bit too much at times and almost feel like a twilight movie covered with a little Spider-man paint. The doctor Kafka character is also insanely stupid. The movie is so busy building up to the sinister six movie, that this movie forgets to have a plot of it's own and all the interesting story lines that are started in the movie, never reaches a fulfilling end. The little kid in the spider-man costume, feels ridiculous and annoying. People constantly lining up right next where Spider-man is fighting the villains, with no concern for their own safety, and the villains never attack them...apparently because they are standing behind a safety railing...and who the hell puts up all these safety railings so fast every time Spiderman fights. All of the sinister six characters are just some equipment created by Oscorp, essentially making all the characters behind the villains completely irrelevant, as anyone can be the Rhino or Doc Ock. Peters mother and father flee and leave Peter behind to protect him, which makes no sense as in more danger left alone.The worst part is that I could easily keep listing bad things.The movie gets some things right, but also takes hugs steps backwards towards the stupid campy superhero movies like Batman and Robin.5 out of 10",3,3,8,13 May 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Good movie, but nothing more
","The Dark Knight Rises is the final chapter in Chris Nolans Batman trilogy. I will not go in to details, just in case you haven't seen it yet.As Nonal has said from the beginning this was the last movie in his Batman universe and therefore he has tried to tie up every loose end, and close the movie of without a cliffhanger or the sense that there will be more to come.I will avoid spoiling anything, but the ending is most likely the part of the film that will split peoples views of the film the most. I personally didn't really like it all that much, but it also didn't, ruin the movie for me.This is more of a Bruce Wayne movie than a Batman movie (much like the Amazing Spider-Man movie), as Bale is only in his cape and cowel for maybe like 30 mins. of the movie. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I would have liked just a little more Batman as this is the last chance to see him in this line of Batman movies. There are tons of amazing set pieces and big money shots, but nothing that will really blow you away like The Dark Knight did. Unfortunately they way too often show Gotham from camera angles, from which anyone in the world can clearly see it's actually Manhatten, NY, it's a little thing but it sadly ruins the illusion that Gotham could be a real place.All in all it's a very good film, that captures the feeling of the previous films very well, it moves along at a little slower pace, but that doesn't matter. I wasn't absolutely in love with it and I'd suggest people don't listen to the ones calling it 'the greatest movie of all time' and such, because you will most likely be disappointed if that's what you're expecting (unless it's the only movie you've ever seen, then you may agree ;)",7,1,5,23 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," So much potential, but ultimately so disappointing
","I'm so sad to have to say this but unfortunately this is not a great movie it's not even a good movie, it's a passable movie and that is just not good enough for a story of this caliber. Here is a summation of the best and worst things about the movie.The good:Affleck is great as Batman, and I look forward to seeing a sole batman film with him.The scenes with Wonder Woman in civilian disguise are very intriguingHenry Cavill is still well cast as Superman.Jeromy Irons is a good Alfred.The bad:There are so many interesting story lines and ideas in the film, but none of them are seen to a satisfying conclusion, if they even receive one at all.The doomsday fight is shallow, you have no emotional involvement in the scene and you don't care about the stakes. Unfortunately he seems completely unnecessary as he himself is not the actual threat, but the pulses he emits feel like the only real danger.No of what Lex Luthor does makes sense. He actes like the Joker from the Dark Knight, just wanting to create chaos with no real point to it all. That's no the way Lex should act.The Justice League stuff is just awful, it seems so cheesy and stupid especially Cyborg and Aquaman.The movie wants to do so much, but ultimately does so little and what it does do ends up feeling unfulfilling and as a wasted opportunity.",5,2,6,25 March 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," No spoilers
","The title of this review is 'no spoilers' not only because I won't spoil anything for you, but also because you should definitely go into to this movie, knowing as little about it as possible.What you need to know is that this movie is WEIRD and it will divide people, some will love it for being so different and crazy, others will hate it and just think it's stupid.If you want to get the most out of this movie, don't label it a horror, Slasher, comedy, thriller, adventure film, because it is none of these and yet it has elements of many different genres.You get a feeling of classic Whedon with this movie, and if you like what he's done in the past, you will most likely like this one as well. It often feels like one of the crazier episodes of 'Buffy the vampire slayer' if it had been a full length movie, that is all you need to know.This really is a great movie, but you have to be able to let the movie step out of the box you normally define genre movie by, and just accept the weirdness of this tale. If you do then you might just love it as well.",8,1,5,21 August 2012
