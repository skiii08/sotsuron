","I am typing this, while watching the original TV movie. I was excited and nervous to watch the new version..I finally saw it a few days ago and boy I was impressed! I was impressed at how directors, writers and editors can really miss the mark and destroy a film. In my opinion this movie,if you want to call it that, was a mess.The pacing was off and rushed.I did like the first few minutes. The build up was nice, but after that it was overwrought with laughable CGI, and characters I didn't really 'get'. These kids were supposed to be 'losers' and band together to conquer Pennywise. The film failed to reach down and give us an in depth look at fear and how each of these kids were tormented. Pennywise was only creepy in the beginning when he was talking to Georgie in the sewer..There was no CGI and Skarsgard nailed the scene with subtlety. After that they CGI'd him to death which made his scenes laughably bad. How they came together and confronted IT was not executed in the right way. There were some good moments, but the bad outweighed the good, in my opinion. If you are fan of CGI in horror movies,underdeveloped characters and a hodge podge of scenes that destroy the story, then you will love this.",4,4,9,16 September 2017

","Wow.This has to be one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It was unsettling , challenging, depressing, bizarre and brilliant..A movie that really makes you think. Lots of symbolism and metaphors. If that's not your thing, then you might hate this film. On the other hand, if you start to figure out what is going on, it may just suck you in, wanting more. It's a film you will talk about and remember after viewing it, even if you despised it. Haven't seen one of those in a while. Loved the style of the film, with the camera angles, tone and very minimal music/score. This movie literally had minimal to no music, which added to the unsettling feeling. When things start to really get crazy in the second half , I felt uneasy, in a good way. Kudos to the main actors and background extras. There were some scenes that were downright crazy and intense. Overall, I thought this was a great film. Actually, it was more like an experience. It was a nice change from all the mediocre, lame brain , re-hashed, unoriginal crap that has come out recently. I will probably watch it again!",9,0,2,20 September 2017
