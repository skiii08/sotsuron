The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Life is paradoxical, but not that much.
","It is no wonder that it was hard to Kieslowki to find a suitable title for this movie. In fact, the double life of Veronique is the leading, but not the main theme of the work.Consider the two halves of the movie corresponding to the lives of the two Veroniques. The second half of the film is mostly devoted to the strange and failed love encounter of the French Veronique. By making her lover a puppet player who can't resist manipulating or taking advantage of Veronique, either for his books or his plays, Kieslowski seems to hint to the idea of Veronique being no more than a puppet of life. This now becomes the main theme, in which the double life is but another product.
But it was not essential to Kieslowski to simply hint at the mystery of life, so paradoxical as to produce the strange events shown in this film. As he later proved in RED, there IS an order of life, even if paradoxical to man's mind; an order capable of transcending - and transgressing - our rational perspectives. The only problem for Kieslowski - as for the puppet player/writer - was to make sure that these transgressions occur and are in fact possible. And it is here, IMHO, that the film fails: I couldn't really believe the 'metaphor' of two women being the same, at the same time, one feeling like the other, or one following the other's story. It is not like the (true) story of the journalist finding himself in a novel by Cortazar, who never knew him. This fact often quoted by Kieslowski, revealed to him the strange symmetry of life when rightly perceived by man and was the sort of rationally-twisting life symmetries that he wanted to show in his movies.But in this work these rationally-twisting symmetries are  too 'worked-out', too artificial to be credible. Given that this was the stuff of the color trilogy, the Double Life of Veronique may rightly be considered as a first approach to such major artistic and visionary problem.",6,8,18,5 March 2002
