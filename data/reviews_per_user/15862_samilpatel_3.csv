Hereditary," A true Horror Masterpiece
",I went into Hereditary with my guard firmly up. It has to be to be one of the most hyped horror films of recent years and when expectations are raised it is almost inevitable that disappointment will follow. For once the hype is justified. Hereditary is a flat out Masterpiece. Not since watching The Shining on the big screen many decades ago have I been so mesmerized. Hereditary has been compared to the equally classic The Exorcist but I would go as far as to say it's an even better film than that classic. Not that it's a competition of course! Just an indicator of how good this film is. The direction and cinematography is superb. Ari Aster has come out of the gates with one of the most impressive debuts imaginable. The sense of dread he creates from the first frame to the last is palpable. What truly sets this apart from the vast majority of horror films is the level of performance. Every cast member is brilliant but Toni Collete should win every award going. I can't imagine seeing a better performance in 2018 by any actor and will surely be looked back upon as one of the iconic roles of the genre. If you like proper adult horror that demands your full attention you simply have to watch it. Not only the best horror of the year but the best film of the year.10/10,10,3,7,11 September 2018
The Machinist," Maybe Bales best performance?
","The Machinist is most famous for Christian Bale's remarkable weight loss. While his disturbingly emaciated frame undeniably acts as a striking visual metaphor for the notion of 'guilt eating the soul', the film is much more than an exercise in extreme method acting. Bale could of played this role 20 pounds over weight and I suspect it still would have had the same haunting power.Bale is wonderful here. As a horrifically sleep deprived, guilt ridden man slipping into psychosis this may well be his most memorable and complex performance. I can only speculate that Bale wasn't Oscar nominated because this type of genre film making is simply not recognized by the academy. This is a shame because the Machinist is the rare marriage of a superlative central performance meeting exceptional film making. It is no mean feat to make a film that is thrilling, unsettling and that also packs an emotional wallop but Brad Anderson has somehow managed to pull it off.",9,0,1,6 September 2018
Cube," Low budget Sci-Fi Classic
","Taken completely objectively and one could certainly argue that Cube is a little rough around the edges. The acting can be inconsistent, the dialogue occasionally stilted and the SFX somewhat representative of it's evidently low budget. It is also undoubtedly one of the best Science fiction films of the 90's as well as being one of the most impressive directorial debuts in cinema. This low budget gem has more intelligence, originality and invention than 95 per cent of the Science Fiction regularly churned out by Hollywood studios with a 100 times the budget at their disposal. A group of people wake up in a cube shaped room that is rigged with traps...and that's all you want to know going in. If you like inventive, original and tightly wound cinema then watch it. You wont be disappointed.",9,1,2,5 September 2018
