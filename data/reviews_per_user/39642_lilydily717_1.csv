Iron Man 3," Horrible Plot / Contrived Storyline
","WARNING... WARNING... WARNING... Don't waste your valuable time seeing this poorly written movie.Story relies too much on the special effects rather then character development and acting. Final Fight scene seems to drag on... and on and on... which seems like an eternity, just wished the villain would die already! Couldn't keep track of the action sequence, way too much going on with the 100+ 'ironmen' suits flying every which way. Don't think this story had anything do do with the original comic series, horribly written and thought out.Good thing I didn't pay a dime because it's not even worth a nickle. Guess Hollywood is a sequel factory now just trying to churn out the next sequel as fast as they can to make a fast buck... it's a sad day for movie making with actual content this summer!",1,3,8,31 August 2013
