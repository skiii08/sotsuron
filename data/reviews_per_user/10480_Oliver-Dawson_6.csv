First Man," Super
","From my eyes, the movie was great.
Great in a sense that how it gave spaceflight history knowledge to ordinary people. It teached the life of Neil, how dangerous Apollo missions were and what
it took to become a astronaut who went to the moon.
Story might have felt boring, but you cant make real life that interesting always when you are using facts.
I think what alot of people are getting wrong about this was the fact it wasnt made to be crazy action movie or so, since it is biography.
I think Neil was too robotic in the movie, felt bit like Spock from Star Trek.
He had emotions but most of the time he was just there with a plain face doing his job. But still i liked Ryan playing Neil.I give my 9 stars to CGI ,Story , Characters and the fact it was one of the best movies of 2018.",9,1,3,12 February 2019
Aquaman," Go watch it
","Now im fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC's aswell.
Problem with both of those is that only few of their films are good, everything else they make is only for money.
but this, this was gold.StoryHonestly i expected this to be crap and have same old story, but no.
When tsunami came, i though Aquamans dad would die, but he didnt, so it didnt give that usual superhero story vibe, it felt better. Aswell the part that he didnt want to rule the kingdom or have anything to do with it.CharactersYou cant have better Aquaman than Jason Momoa, he literally borned for this part. He looked perfect, his acting was on point and boy, that golden aquaman suit made my day.Mera aka Amber Heard, aswell good acting and looked perfect for the part.Vulko, was 5/10 character, same old family friends who helps out the Prince.My 8 points go to good CGI,Story,Characters and for being one of the best superhero movies of this decade.",8,0,0,7 February 2019
Downfall," Super!
","Just wow, the movie realy grabs the accuracy of the events that happened in 1945.
Watching the people who were around Hitler at the time change their minds or be true to their country is realy interesting.
Directors and writers realy knew what they wanted the audience feels and see.",10,0,0,18 February 2019
Black Panther," Politics + Marvel = horrible
","Anyone reading this review, this movie aint good.
This movie wasnt made for real audience to enjoy, it was more motivated or used to power the politics. Atleast if not either of those then it was certainly full of controversial topics.
Also this was overhyped and still is.
It is as bad as Captain america Civil War or Iron man 3.Story was predictable and boring.Chasing, Fight, searching, chasing, death, revival, fight.
Thats my summary for the story.CharactersT'Challa was good for most of the part but he died and then wow, he came back alive.
We had angry man named Erik who wanted revenge for his dads death, thats realy new (sarcasm)
Ulysses Klaue, thief and murderer who screwed over everyone when time was right and in the end he got screwed over, talk about karma.
Everett K, well he realy did not have much point in the movie did he.My 2 stars go out for good CGI and okay acting.",2,11,18,7 February 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Hilarious
","I didnt check out what the movie was about before i watched it and i must say it was a good choice.
I havent seen anything this funny for years.
My two favorite characters were Fraulein Rahm and Adolf.
Best line in the movie for me was ' Go give americans a hug '
U gotta watch this",10,1,1,15 February 2020
Godzilla," Watch it in cinema
","Big gigantic monsters fighting among humans, hell yeah!Godzilla is a excellent movie, but theres a problem.
It isnt made for home viewing, if you happened to watch it in cinema and later on home then you understand.
In cinema everything is bigger, louder and gives more chills.
In home if you dont have a home theater system and turn up the volume, you wouldnt still get that exact feeling, its just made for cinema watching.Story is good, specially i like how Ford Brody moves around in the movie, how he isnt lingering in one place, he has a goal, but he does everything that it takes to reach that goal.CGI is on point with the sound effects, hearing how the Godzilla charges up to shoot out the flames, just gives you the chills...
Super movie, if you watch it in cinema",7,1,2,17 February 2019
