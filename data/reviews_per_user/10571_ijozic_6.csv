Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A total disappointment (and I liked the first movie)
","While the first movie was a bit unorthodox regarding its portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, it functioned because of the good performance of the main actors, a very convincing villain and a good plot which had more than a necessary amount of mystery for an SH plot, made even stronger by toying with the elements of the occult. Occasional action scenes, though sometimes overdone, were rather original and few and far between to annoy.The sequel though seems to be written by a different set of writers. There is no plot whatsoever above the basic premise which can be told in a sentence or two. The only mystery present was what actually connects all too many random and overly long action sequences and dispensable characters together. And though the main actors might still be pushing hard, their lines rarely work, being written poorly as they are. To accommodate for the weak script, Robert Downey character's eccentricity seems to be simply pushed much too far this time that it becomes annoying rather than fun. Jude Law repeats the first role as much as possible with the lines he's been given and is a rare memento to what worked well in the first movie. Rachel McAdams was a rare miss in the first movie, so the fact she doesn't play a larger role in this one can only be a plus. I'm still puzzled by the gypsy woman character's purpose in the movie, but it only underlines the weak script as this character is actually one of the main ones. And the villain himself leaves an impression of a low-level local gangster given to play with higher stakes (selling weapons to opposing countries, rather than illegal liquor) which, unfortunately for the script writers, doesn't automatically create a character of a top criminal mastermind. As there was no secrecy about him or his plan or his ulterior motives even, the 'game of shadows' being played between him and the SH is reduced to running around the Europe at seemingly random locations, fighting (in the most direct sense of the word) the forgettable villains alone while trying to save the world. And if that might sound more like a James Bond script to you (as mentioned in some other review), you would not be mistaken.Just avoid it. It made for a very tedious experience and the only thing I cared about while watching was that it finishes as soon as possible so I can forget about it.",3,7,12,16 January 2012
U-571," Hollywood war at it's most stupid ever
","I can't believe I actually really looked forward to see this flick. I thought it would be a new Das Boot and I made arrangements with the people in the cinema to give me the big poster afterwards. What a load of bulls***. I have seen bad movies, but this is unbelievable. Maybe some average viewer who just want to see some action and some evil Nazis killed might find this piece thrilling, but for anyone even remotely interested in history (and good war dramas), this movie is a complete disaster. It's just one pathetic and thrilling scene after another. Admittedly, I have seen it some time ago so I don't remember all of the flaws, but I remember that if I was not laughing, I was crying. So just keep the damn poster!",1,1,4,30 August 2001
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Dreadful. Terrible script and editing. Do not waste your money.
","Don't buy the overwhelming positive reviews. To put things into the context, I liked the first Mission Impossible which had a cool atmosphere as a throwback to the original series presumably (which I didn't watch). The sequel was a typical John Woo action vehicle with a few MI touches added (like masks) - hated it. I really liked the rather realistically done MI3 and loved the main character's chemistry with his wife, but then it was all wasted in the 4th installment which was rather generic and boring (hated the Simon Pegg addition to be a comic relief in yet another movie).Reading the reviews I had high hopes, but the movie is too long, boring with too many plot holes to comprehend, presumably due to terrible editing. There is a love interest (albeit rather one sided, it seems), but it's not developed in any way. There is a potentially interesting anti-IMF organization, but it's not developed in any way. The main infiltration seems to copy the one from the first movie with some ridiculous additions, but it's used up rather quickly leaving you to wonder what was the point of including it. I can't escape the feeling that the script was either too long or incomplete and many scenes were just improvised and tacked on as the shooting went on. I actually intend to watch the hated MI4 just to see which one made less sense.",3,9,20,18 August 2015
Django Unchained," Expectedly disappointed in unexpected ways
","Tarantino seems to have been running out of ideas lately and relies on shock and gore rather than on a good script to make his movies stand out.I really disliked Inglorious Bastards as, except for two brilliant scenes (the first scene with Christopher Waltz and the dialog in the basement pub seemingly inspired by a scene from Where Eagles Dare), the movie was just juvenile, stupid and just plain disgusting occasionally. Now, Django fares a little better as there is not so much stupidity in the script (and no characters like Brad Pitt and his squad from Inglorious Bastards), but there is little worthy of mention, either.(SPOILERS ahead) The movie starts on a good foot with Waltz setting Django free to help him identify three former slave farm supervisors. Now, for a western revenge movie, hunting these three guys to pay for what they have done to him and his wife would have been the central plot of this movie. Django would have time to slowly develop his relationship with his German 'owner' from distrust to even some kind of friendship (not to mention his weapon skills). Instead, they instantly become friends and Django, seemingly a born gunslinger, kills those three guys on the first farm they visit. The movie drags on unnecessarily after that only to finally switch to a search for Django's wife (who is alive and mostly well, as it turns out, thus nullifying any potential revenge factor). She is located on DiCaprio's farm where Django performs his fake slave-owner character unexpectedly (and illogically) well, but surprisingly, the experienced German head-hunter, who otherwise kills people without a second thought with a mathematically cold logic, somehow fails to hide his shock and disgust of a few (admittedly gruesome) slave deaths. I was at least hoping that it would turn out that he was playing some double game and that he will turn on Django, but that was just wishful thinking. Surprisingly, the cool German fails to keep his cool once more and shoots DiCaprio's character, gets killed and with him what little coherence was there in the movie. After an unnecessarily long and blood bursting firefight, Django is taken alive (why?), but instead of being tortured (why?), he is sold to some miners to face a fate worse than any gruesome death itself (supposedly, as all we have are words by Jackson's character). But, somehow he convinces the miner's men or whoever they were as the movie doesn't bother to explain (nor did I care by that point) to let him go (wtf?) and even give him a gun (WTF?); then he spares no thought in killing them for some reason (why?) and runs back to the farm where previously dozens of armed men were holding guard, but for some reason none remain. He shoots the totally unused James Remar character, plus the unused lawyer and Candy's sister characters while releasing the unnecessary Candy's mistress character. Also, underused Samuel L. Jackson's character is shot (didn't really find him mean or anything, but more like a semi-stupid old fool). Django then shows that he's handy with dynamite, too, and leaves the farm with a cartoon-like explosion in the background (Candy must have been holding a dynamite storage there) and rides into the sunset with his rather bland and unconvincing wife character. The end. Notice how there's so many times I mention the words 'for some reason' and 'unused', as somehow the movie of some two and a half hours fails to find any space for development of most of its characters or to cater us with some logic behind its characters' actions.I ended up liking some of the music used and DiCaprio's character - not that it was a memorable character, but DiCaprio did a great job with a lousy script at hand. Waltz was OK, but kind of predictable as his character is rather similar to the character in Inglorious Bastards in his overdone slow and meticulous explanations, but ridden of any menace and thus, any powerful impact. Jackson was good, but his character was criminally limited by the script. Disappointing and very unnecessary. Oh, sounds like my review! Wait..",3,8,12,19 February 2013
Drive," Worth your while if you're into such movies
","I thought it was a solid movie in general, with a nice Michael Mann movie kind of a style of music and atmosphere throughout it, so if you're into that, you might want to check it out. It was finely crafted with the highlight of the movie being the car chase scene at its beginning.Main actors put on rather convincing performances for a movie where the dialog is very sparse (Carey Mulligan fits her role very nicely), though Ryan Gosling was maybe limited by this as I found myself expecting a bit more out of him. The standout miscast would definitely be Albert Brooks whose character definitely talks too much and his act on it seems more suitable for a Seinfeld episode or some low budget wannabe deep crime drama. The final showdown is also a big letdown as there's too little suspense about it and it's done in a way totally unconvincing for most crime movies let alone a movie with driving in its name.Still, I think they pulled a rather enjoyable movie considering the thin and unoriginal script and what seems as a limited budget, especially compared to other movies being on offer this summer.",Null,0,1,21 October 2011
In Time," Worst movie I've seen in quite some time
","I can't remember the last time I watched a movie THIS bad in cinema. I saw some of the trailers and expected some sci-fi action movie between some P. K. Dick stories and Logan's Run, but what you actually get here is some cheap teenage entertainment TV-series pilot only with no entertainment part. The script is the worst part here and the entire story can be told in a few sentences. Any deeper social messages it tries to push are so contrived and shallow that they bring tears to your eyes (but in the good way). The dialog is bad and clichéd and definitely is somewhat to be blamed for the allover atrocious acting in the movie as the characters are thinner than in Marvel comics. With such few and lousy lines and amateur directing, all traces of any character developments depend solely on the charisma of the particular actor. All this makes this pile of garbage very painful to watch till the end and if there was ever a movie I should walk out from, this would be it. Fortunately, the cinema was empty so some beers and commenting with a friend who found his only interest in watching the main actress in mini skirts and high heels. Oh, the dressing of all the characters was very slick so I'm starting to think if the movie was not sponsored by some brand of clothing and all this is nothing more but a bad commercial gone worse..",Null,0,2,4 November 2011
