Raiders of the Lost Ark," one of my favorite movies of all time
","I was 13 at the time Raiders came out (1981) and I will never forget seeing this movie. My father took me on a vacation that summer to Yellowstone National Park and Jackson Hole WY. One of the best weeks of my life. We went on a rafting trip on the Snake River, saw the geysers in Yellowstone and other fun interesting things.One night we went out to dinner then went to an old movie theater in Jackson Hole to see Raiders. What a great movie for a 13 year old boy, full of action, great storytelling, and at the time state of the art special effects. I wanted to be INDY.Now i am middle aged, my father has passed away. If I would see this movie today for the first time I probably give it an 8. Still a great score. But for me every time I watch it, I can become that 13 year old boy in Jackson Hole WY.Great movies bring out emotion. It is what makes them great. For me Raiders brings me back to a better time when life was pure and simple and my father was still alive. Pure emotion.Why this movie will always be a 10of10 for me. A great fun movie if you haven't seen it do so. There is a lot worse ways to spend 2 hours of your life",10,1,2,10 May 2016
The Revenant," Bears hibernate
","One of the worst movies I have ever saw. Complete boredom and pure stupidity.Spoilers!!!!! Started off well, beautiful scene where Leo and his son out on a hunt and a river running through foggy trees. Then a nice battle scene with the Indians trying to take the trappers pelts. Then it went downhill from here into movie hell.Hugh (Leo) then gets mauled by a female bear who has her cubs. Its winter Bears hibernate. Bear cubs come in the springtime, not winter. They usually are grown at winter time. After Hugh Glass kills the bear he falls down a hill where the dead 500 ilb bear falls on top of him. It doesn't kill him. DAMN the bad luck could have saved 2 hours of boredom.Tom Hardy kills Leo's half American Indian son in front of him. Setting up the original plot, revenge. Then Leo gets buried alive, still survives. Goes floating down whitewater rapids after getting mauled by a bear. He has a bear skin on, Wouldn't it fill up with water an drown him. No of course not, be to logical for this completely stupid film. Damn the bad luck. Washes ashore completely wet and lights a fire. More stupidity. Once again damn the bad luck, he doesn't die from hypothermia.At this point I lost all interest in Leo's character. He's obviously immortal and will get his revenge.So the villain better be good. Tom Hardy was the villain. He tried to talk with a Texas accent. You couldn't understand him. He mumbled his lines. Horrible villain. Tom was just a stupid man trying to make a living stealing and killing whoever crossed him. Nothing interesting in his character either. He's also a rapist.After Leo rides a horse off a cliff into a huge pine tree, he still survives. He got mauled by a bear earlier. Lives inside a gutted horse for a while the crawls and grunts his way to the Army barracks.Inside the Army barracks is Tom Hardy. But Tom robs the barracks and only 2 people (Leo and the captain) look for him. Why wouldn't the whole barracks look for him? More stupidity from a stupid movie.Finally a mauled Leo, who can barely walk, fights Tom. Wounds him and leaves him for some random Indians to kill him. Getting his revenge and this 2:30 minute bore-athon to finally end.After the movie ended I stood up and said 'wow an overrated piece of garbage.' Everyone sitting by me agreed. Guess wasn't the only one bored by this dull movie. Surprise the director gave us Birdman, the worst movie ever to win best picture.In real life Hugh Glass had no wife or children. He also got mauled in August and made it back to the barracks in early October. When bears get ready for their long nap.2 stars due to the amazing cinematography. Amazing looking film. Just boring watching Leo grunt, crawl and sleep in the snow. Living when logic says he should be dead.",2,3,5,13 May 2016
Jaws," I have no buttons on my shirt anymore
","I was 9 or 10 when I saw this movie for the first time. My mom wouldn't take me to it at the theater. She said it was to scary for me at the time. Good parenting. I believe it was 1977 or 1978 Jaws was on HBO and my parents where going out to dinner. My neighbor Dwight came over to watch. When they got home a few hours later they found 2 terrified young boys. I think I pooped my pants and had bitten off every button on my shirt from pure fear. I never have been that scared my entire life.Now I am older, but still love this movie. I know the shark kinda looks dumb with today's computer special effects. But it looked plenty real enough to a 9 year old with no buttons on his shirt.The movie was an introduction to Spielberg. It had great acting, storytelling, character development and was brilliantly directed and written. The thing we expect from him, and why I love most of his movies. My favorite scene of all time is when they are below deck and telling their scar stories, and Quinn wins with his USS Indy story. He was so horrifying telling that.I still see my friend Dwight from time to time. Over a beer we still talk about the night we watched JAWS. He gives me hell today for biting off all my buttons. But this movie was more to me then that, it piqued my intelligence. How many movies can say that. Now I got a masters in History and love studying about WWII. I love shark week on the discovery channel. The best week of TV every year. I wish I would have taken up marine biology, but hard when you live in Wisconsin.Great movies spark emotion. JAWS brought me to the most scariest place I have ever been. JAWS brought out pure fear in me. A great emotion. But it also molded me and my interests. How many movies have done that for you? This is why JAWS is my favorite movie of all time. And why i watch it every chance I see it on. A 10 for me is too low of a score. I give it a 20.",10,1,2,10 May 2016
