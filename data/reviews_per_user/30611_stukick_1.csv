The Blair Witch Project," With repeated viewings.....
","When I first saw this movie, I thought to myself, I hope they're giving refunds at the door as I leave. But after I returned home and had a chance to think about it, I realized how original this movie was. I recently received a copy on DVD and after viewing it for a second time, it was much better the second time. I think that sitting in the comfort of my home added to the enjoyment. For those who didn't like it, I can understand your complaints. However, you need to look at this movie like it really happened, like you were there, and use your imagination. I promise it does get better with repeated viewings.",10,1,2,29 October 1999
