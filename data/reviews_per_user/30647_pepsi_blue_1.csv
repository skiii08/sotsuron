The Ring," I was so scared I couldn't leave!
","The ring portrays the true meaning of wetting your pants. This movie scared me for days. To tell you the truth I was hearing weird sounds from my T.V. YIKES! I especially loved the mystery around the Morgan family, and their psycho daughter...Samara. The part I thought was most interesting was the tape. It was kind of like a chain letter, except your life was at stake.I was trying to think of happy things during the movie!I thought I loved horror movies, thats what I thought, then I saw the ring. It was hard for me to say the name of the movie of even talk about it.If you watch this movie, I hope you have a strong stomach!",Null,0,0,1 November 2002
