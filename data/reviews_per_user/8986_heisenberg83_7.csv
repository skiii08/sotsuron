Alien 3," See the Special Edition - it's great!
","Wow - just watched Alien 3 for the first time since I was about 12 years old. Blew me away how much I enjoyed it! After re-watching Fight Club and Se7en recently, I remembered that there was an Alien movie directed by David Fincher and thought holy cow, I gotta re-watch that one. Alien 3 definitely gets way better when you're older. As a kid, I just remember it being dark, gloomy, slow and boring compared to Aliens. It matures with age. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I was surprised how unpredictable and surprising the kills were! Some bits really surprised and shocked me as people were picked off. Ripley looks so hard and cool with the shaved head look too, you don't see female heroes like that anymore, just women like Angelina Jolie in 'Salt'. It also reminded me of the dark, gritty, gloomy graphic novels I like - it looks like a living breathing graphic novel. I only realised after watching it that I'd seen the Special Edition that restores extra scenes that David Fincher wanted in there - I must recommend the Special Edition, without these scenes ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alien+3+scenes&aq=f ) I can imagine the film would feel shallower and rushed.**spoiler**I also liked the idea that the Alien wouldn't touch Ripley because it knew she was breeding the Queen. It is an extremely dark film though especially how we have to sit through an autopsy of Newt within the first 15 minutes! The way the countdown is happening to the arrivial of the Weylon-Utani 'rescue team' reminded me of the plot of the recent Sam Rockwell film 'Moon'. **end of spoiler**Wow, all I can say I really enjoyed it a lot, and surprised at the dreadful reviews on IMDb. I think Fincher takes way too much stick for this one. Compared to the Alien movies that followed, this is easily a masterpiece. You're gonna hate me for saying this but I haven't enjoyed Aliens as much when I've seen it recently, I found Alien 3 had more depth to the characters!",9,12,12,23 September 2010
The Longest Yard," Really odd tone for a Happy Madison flick
","Such a weird weird movie this one. I was so surprised it was actually a Happy Madison Production as it's so unlike any other movies by them & Adam Sandler. It took me a while to realise but this movie is actually trying to take itself fairly seriously. And so is Sandler. He's actually attempting to play a straight dramatic role. But then they try to throw in the odd bit of typical Happy Madison Adam Sandler humour but it feels forced & flat. The movie can't decide if it's a stupid comedy or a seriously dramatic sports flick. The worst thing about this movie is that they COMPLETELY waste Hollywood Legend Burt Reynolds. He literally is given nothing to do or say even remotely interesting or comedic. He has zero character & zero chemistry with Sandler. If he was supposed to be a sort of Mr Miyagi inspirational mentor type of character, it missed the mark hugely. Eveytim he's onscreen I hoped Burt would have something interesting or funny to say. But nothing. It's a very weirdly under written role for poor Burt. Courtney Cox is totally wasted too. Thankfully Happy Madison & Adam Sandler went back to their usual slapstick humour / formula after this one which was a big relief for their hardcore fans. Recently I watched 'Just Go with It' for the first time & it was excellent, a million times better than this tripe.",3,1,3,15 August 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction - I absolutely loved it.
","Just come out the cinema and felt the need to review this fabulous movie. I really didn't enjoy Tarantino's last movie ('Deathproof') so I didn't enter this one with high expectations. But it was phenomenal. From the opening scenes, I could see Tarantino had taken the Sergio Leone formula ('The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly') and cleverly transposed it into the WW2 era in Nazi-occupied France. In fact, the opening scenes at the milk farm are incredibly similar in tone and feel to the opening scenes of Leone's GBU. Every scene of this movie is beautifully shot and wonderful to watch. Tarantino has returned to form here and works the camera like a master. I was reminded of the kind of suspense you get from Alfred Hitchcock's best suspenseful scenes. Much of this movie is like that, an ever increasing build-up of suspense taking the audience to cracking point before letting off the steam. Brad Pitt's performance as Aldo Raines is terrific and leaves you begging for more, and the guy who played the main Nazi villain, and the cinema owner girl. All terrific. Even Eli Roth didn't bother me in his role which I thought he would. The use of movie music was great (especially BATTLE OF ALGIERS in the prison break scene) and moments of typical Tarantino humour made me smile throughout. I didn't know what was going to happen next and that's what makes a great movie for me. He has made a really top World War 2 movie here, without resorting to barely any clichés or action at all. I don't wanna give anything away but this has gone straight into my top 10 favourite movies of all time. Even the use of contemporary music (David Bowie for example) doesn't seem as odd as it sounds and works really well. I'll be getting the soundtrack and the DVD. Oh, and thanks for letting the Jews wins this one Tarantino, good man!",10,65,129,23 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful images but painfully dull plot & pacing
","This film is beautiful to watch - like looking at a wonderful photo album of a fantasy world. But it is PAINFULLY slow and dull. I gave it a second watch recently and after about 1.5 hours into it I was playing with my iPHONE instead. The trouble is the protagonists are invincible and you know they're always going to be okay. And even worse, the director throws at them stupid number of baddies which is totally unrealistic, and there's no real sense of danger. The battle scenes are too CGI obviously, and go on too long.Watch the original 'Clash of the Titans' instead.",6,3,7,18 December 2009
District 9," Terminator 4 / Transformers 2? Eat your heart out!
","Ace movie – loved every second of it! Influences are: Doom, Half-Life, Robocop, Aliens etc! I honestly went into this movie TOTALLY cold. Glad I didn't read Total Film review (just read it now and it is spoiler city). The trailer (which I did see) really marketed the film differently. It didn't give anything away which was great. The comedy vibe in the first 15-20 minutes really threw me – but I was laughing loads. The main actor was GREAT. He reminded me very much of a South African Bruce Campbell (replace chainsaw arm with alien arm). Also, the humour was very reminiscent of that South African comedy movie Gods Must Be Crazy. Well impressed with how he flicked from geeky patronising comedic character to Daniel Craig style action man. I laughed out loud in loads of bits. Didn't expect it to get so touching. Loved the Alien that helped him and was really worried he was gonna get killed. Honestly didn't have a clue how the film was going to progress from one scene to the next. Couldn't help thinking how much this film totally blitzes recent robot/alien movies I've seen like Terminator 4 and Transformers 2. They're so bad compared to this.**spoiler**The tone of the film really switched from uncomfortable comedy to disturbing/violence when they were experimenting on him with his Alien hand, and got him to shoot the Prawn. And then were gonna split open his chest. I wanted to look away there, but was so glad when he fought back and I realised we were in for a Doug Quaid/Half Life esquire breakout from the Lab.The Alien weaponry at the end scenes were fantastic. Loved the Robocop II esquire suit that froze all the bullets shot at it, and then fired them back at people. And the way people got splatted by the weapons like a frag in a deathmatch. That captain grunt looked just like Michael Ironside. Blows away Starship Troopers to, don't it?**spoiler finished**Definitely one I'll be buying on DVD.",10,1,4,25 September 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Bit too much action and not enough witty dialogue
","Started off REALLY well. I loved the fun dialogue between Watson and Holmes. But quickly descended into a non-stop sequence of fight scenes, edited so tightly you can't see what's going on. I wish there had been more of the banter and dialogue seen in the early scenes of the movie, like the restaurant scene with Watson's lady. Robert Downey Jr is very enjoyable as Holmes. I think perhaps Guy Ritchie used a lot of influences from Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone (listen to the score - sounds like Once Upon a Time in the West, and the hanging scene as well). Still, it is enjoyable enough and I was glad to see Holmes' detection techniques highlighted well. I think Conan Doyle will be spinning slightly in his grave mind you!",6,2,5,2 January 2010
X2: X-Men United," Feels 'flat'
","Worth seeing just for the incredible opening sequence with Nightcrawler in the White House...otherwise... ...this 'superhero' movie failed for me for several reasons:1 - it's all set in warehouses and underground complexes...there's no 'city feeling' (like Spider-Man, Batman etc).  No civilians to save or interact with (the first X-Men movie had this a bit). 2 - mutants are 2-dimensional (Wolverine is moody and grunts, guy with shades moans a lot, Jean Grey is just a 'nice' person, Storm is 'caring', Professor X is Captain Picard) 3 - the action/fight sequences suffer from choppy MTV-style editing (like Lord of the Rings) - don't sit near the front or you'll feel ill by the end. The camera shakes and chops every second. 4 - two huge plot holes I've described below (to avoid spoilers)Spider-Man was far more enjoyable.  This one wants to be an epic on the scale of Star Wars, but feels like you're on a set.  There's no feeling of wonder or scale.  The first X-Men movie was better - seeing how the humans react to the mutants.Roll on Hulk!If you've seen X-Men 2, here are the two plot holes I noticed:
**SPOILERS**
a)  When Jean-Grey sacrifices herself for the team.  Nightcrawler blatantly could have teleported out, grabbed her, teleported back into the ship. But when asked to do this, he replied with a really duff line: 'She won't let me,' - and Wolverine was like, 'Oh, okay, then.'  He should have nagged him a bit more!b)  This was a biggie.  Wheelchair-bound Jason (son of Stryker) is a mutant. So when Professor X is concentrating on 'all mutants', it should have affected Jason as well!  It was loop-back feed and would have destroyed him too.  And if you argue that Jason was not a mutant, he was human, then he should have been affected when Professor X was 'switched' by Magneto to think of 'all humans' instead.  Perhaps the X-Men devotees will correct me on this somehow?",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
