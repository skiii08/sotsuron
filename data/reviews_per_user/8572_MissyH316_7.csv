Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Since seeing 'The Last Jedi'...
","...I can no longer say that 'The Phantom Menace' is my least favorite Star Wars movie. There's still a lot about TPM that I don't care for, but at least it felt like it belonged in the Star Wars Universe. 'Ruin' Johnson's TLJ film reflected his audacity and abuse of carte blanche (no thanks to Kathleen Kennedy and Disney) to just make it up as HE wanted with no respect for the Star Wars continuity and canon.",4,3,5,19 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Now THIS is a REAL 'Star Wars' prequel!!
","This was just excellent all around!! I was literally on the edge of my seat, more and more as the film progressed, right up through the end. I also was in complete awe of how WELL this tied into (and definitely had the FEEL of) the first 'Star Wars' trilogy (Eps. IV-VI)! It sure did this long-time 'Star Wars' fan's heart good to see maybe the BEST 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back' - and it was about time! How anyone can say this movie isn't part of the 'Star Wars' canon is beyond me - but in the long run, I don't care because *I* will always consider 'Rogue One' an INTEGRAL, canonical 'Star Wars' story. Jyn was probably the best female protagonist I've seen in an action film since Princess Leia and Ellen Ripley (of the 'Alien' series). Also loved seeing a certain Sith Lord kick some SERIOUS butt, even though he's the 'bad guy' - didn't matter to me - it was awesome! Lucasfilm & Co., thanks for FINALLY giving us the prequel we've been wanting so badly to see for a VERY long time!!",9,4,10,23 April 2017
Watchmen," An Excellent Adaptation of the Seminal 'Cerebral' Graphic Novel
","The packed-house midnight premiere audience I was in (amidst mostly 17- to 30-year-old fanboys) watched in reverent awe (with, of course, shouts of exclamation during the more shocking scenes) of what this 'fangirl' calls one of the most well-done movie adaptations to film of ANY novel I've read to date. Certainly no movie is perfect, but I'm not going to bother nit-picking here as I deeply feel Zack Snyder & Co. gave it their all to do proper and faithful justice to the original 'Watchman' graphic novel - and for that they have my utmost respect and appreciation (are you listening, Joel Schumacher?). Another cast & crew may have done it differently and perhaps equally AS well, but I dare anyone else to try and do it better. I think Alan Moore's missing out... oh, well. This is not going to be for everyone's taste, especially those who are expecting a smash-'em-up, explosive action film with well-known, mainstream superheroes. Oh, yes - there's literally some great 'bone-crunching' action, sometimes quite disturbing, delivered with wicked intensity (and daresay occasionally a little amusement) by equal-opportunity butt-kickers. There are also some erotic scenes, and one main character is often nude (true to the original story). But what you have in total is a dark, epic emotional story of powerful but disenchanted protagonists who are still trying to do the right thing for their fellow Americans - at least in their own eyes.For those unfamiliar with 'Watchmen': before you see the film I'd recommend you either just familiarize yourself a little bit with its basic plot and characters, or at least go in with an open mind and no preconceived notions. Its 'R' rating is well-deserved; 'Watchmen' is no children's tale. But to me, all of the more 'adult' aspects of the story were handled within good context of the characters and the storyline, not with immature, gratuitous excess for shock value alone. My recommendation: go see this intriguing, intelligent, dark and disturbing story of fallible superheroes versus the world. Fans, if nothing else I think you'll appreciate the filmmakers' efforts to stay respectfully true to the original story - others, expect the unexpected and enjoy the ride. :-)",9,1,6,6 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Captain Jack IS Back!! :-)
","Well, I'm so glad I avoided reading any reviews before seeing this movie so I could decide its merits (or failures) for myself, because I thoroughly ENJOYED it!! Heck, I was so enthralled that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen even to enjoy the refreshments I bought (most unusual-lol)!Anyway, to me this was far superior to last film ('On Stranger Tides'). It has a better blend of the action, drama, comedy, eeriness, the supernatural, and interesting characters for which the POTC franchise became known. The story brings some things back around full circle with old and new faces alike, and it has a few small nods / in-jokes to earlier films that us hardcore fans in particular would appreciate.To sum it up, I thought it was a dark, thrilling ride that I'm sure I will watch repeatedly and snatch up the DVD when it comes out. Welcome back, Captain Jack!! :-)",9,1,4,13 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE WITH MARK HAMILL!
","*** There be spoilers ahead! ***With the first scene of Luke and Rey - picking up exactly where TFA ended - I KNEW this movie was in trouble and definitely 'had a bad feeling about this'. So I'm in complete agreement with what Mark Hamill and many of my fellow reviewer have expressed: Rian Johnson got the characterization of Luke and some of the others WRONG.Did Johnson ever (even care to) watch and study the earlier films, the original trilogy in particular? Or even Rogue One which, immediately after I saw it, I considered it a GENUINE 'Star Wars' movie and an excellent prequel to 'A New Hope'. In fairness to this movie, it WAS good to see Luke, Leia, Chewy, C-3PO, R2-D2 and even BB-8 onscreen again. Heck, I even sorta liked the Porgs! Here's my overall take-away from this film: What Luke immediately did with his old lightsabre forewarned the ever-downward trajectory of my hopes for TLJ the movie. But in the big picture - i.e., the 40-year history of the Star Wars iconic, canonical lore - it showed me that apparetly the Star Wars franchise baton has been wrongly passed onto incompetent and flippantly disrespectful 'leaders' who don't deserve it. George, you shouldn't have sold out. :-(",1,2,3,21 December 2017
The Dark Knight," Excellent Use of ALL Characterizations!
","Batman has always been my favorite comics superhero, so of course I was delighted at how well done and how well received 'The Dark Knight' was and has been thus far! I feel it not only more than lived up to the hype, it well exceeded expectations. Director Christopher Nolan did a wonderful job keeping together a record-setting blockbuster that could've easily been a block-BUST mess in the wrong hands.Most surprising to me of all, however, was how well all the main characters - not just The Joker - got good amounts of screen time appropriate to their importance in the overall story. As much as I was looking forward to seeing the late, beloved Heath Ledger's incomparable 'Joker', I was glad that the others - Batman, Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon, Lucius Fox, Alfred, and Rachel Dawes - were also kept in the forefront of the story in an intricate dance of balance and plot pacing. Much like spice in a good recipe, we saw enough of The Joker to make us wish for more of him, but without him totally overpowering the movie as a whole.Whlle it looks like (and I'm hoping that) there will be more 'Batman' movies from Mr. Nolan & Co., I doubt we'll see The Joker as a main character again anytime in the foreseeable future. Really, who'd want to follow Ledger's impeccably entertaining, disturbing, and complex portrayal? The film also had a few other nice surprises for me, such as some great moments of dark humor - plus not all the amazing special effects were of the 'big-bang! explosive!' kind; Harvey Dent's transformation was awesome.So, by all means go see The Dark Knight - again, and again! My friend and I saw it twice Friday night (7/18); he went all decked out as the Joker which just added to our fun evening! He was the only one we saw dressed up in two theaters in Louisville - I guess the 'competition' got wind of it and chickened out. lol Nine (instead of ten) out of ten stars only for what I thought was some plot convolution in the first one-third of the film; otherwise, I heartily recommend it for kids of all ages 10 and up!R.I.P. and God bless Heath Ledger 1979-2008",9,3,8,19 July 2008
The Wrestler," Well done!!
","As someone who's a fan and who has actually worked behind the scenes in pro wrestling, I can tell you that Randy 'The Ram' Robinson's story is a very respectful and realistic portrayal of the toll pro wrestling takes on its stars' lives. Certainly not everyone in the biz ends up as destitute and lonely as Randy was - some do, definitely - but those who end up well-off in every sense of the word (like Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock, for instance) are VERY, VERY rare. Most end up somewhere in between.Interestingly, as precarious as Randy's health became, however, if he were in his mid-50's (as was Mickey Rourke at the time), he still had a longer pro wrestling career than many others who abused their body likewise. Randy still was made up of some very tough stuff and in fact beat the odds with his career length.When asked 'is pro wrestling fake?', I always answer, 'only where it needs to be' - i.e., the story lines and SOME of the action. No one deliberately sets out to end another one's career, but like any other contact sport such as pro football, the athleticism and subsequent pain & injury are all TOO real. There's no 'off season' in pro wrestling, and certainly no astronomically high salaries as other pro athletes make - not by a long shot. But in pro wrestling you'll find the best athletes in the world.Bottom line: It's a brutal business and an extremely hard way to make a living - period. That's why the men and women who stick with it and suffer all they do is for one reason only - because they love it. May God bless them all. :)",8,16,17,31 July 2011
