Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Summary of a film that went wrong beyond belief.
","This film is a very poor result of months of hype of which it is worth about 1/100th. Only Star wars nuts should see this. The Only quite good thing about it was George Lucas' special effects, which deserve some credit. Bring back the days when you concentrated on acting, not hype.",1,21,41,16 July 2000
