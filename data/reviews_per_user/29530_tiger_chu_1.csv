The Blair Witch Project," Should not be seen in the theatres
",I first saw this film on vcd before it came out in the theaters and i didnt realise it was fiction. Ive never heard about the film and didnt see any promos of it anywhere and therefore i thought it was a genuine documentary.But then the promos came flying in and everybody went crazy about it which really ticked me off cause a film like this should not be shown in front of a mass audience. I then went to see it in the theatres and felt that the whole creepy atmosphere that i first felt when i first saw it at home with a couple of friends was just gone and i was very disappointed by it cause it was really good when i first saw it.I wasnt disappointed by the fact that it wasnt real I still love watching it because the whole concept of the film is so original and i have never seen any film like it before. So in conclusion its great film and i advise everyone to see it.,Null,0,1,25 August 2002
